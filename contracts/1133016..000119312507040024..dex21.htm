each other Section or subsection thereof to which the relevance of such
information is reasonably apparent) or (y) as disclosed in the SEC Reports
(excluding (A) any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, (B) any
disclosure constituting forward-looking statements, (C) any other disclosures
to the extent such disclosure is in the nature of a cautionary statement to

expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries or their financial condition, results of operation, revenues,
expenses, cash flows, liquidity or businesses and (D) only with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.8 and 3.10,

standing has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all corporate or similar powers
and authority required to own, lease and operate its respective properties and
to carry on its business as now conducted, except in the case of the

character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or

Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and

Company.

Section 3.4. _Non-Contravention_. Except as set forth in Section 3.4 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene or

Plan (other than any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of ERISA Section
3(37)) and all stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change
in-control, fringe benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and other
material employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other
arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA, whether formal or informal,
oral or written, legally binding or not, under which any Company Employee has
any present or future right to benefits, maintained or contributed to by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any present or future liability (the "Company Benefit
Plans"), no event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there
exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability (other
than a claim for benefits or other event in the ordinary course of business)
that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated, funded
and administered in compliance with its terms and with all applicable
requirements of Law, including ERISA and the Code, except as would not subject
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability that has had or would
be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material

Plan that is subject to ERISA, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trust
created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a
nonexempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code). Except as has not had and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, no "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such
term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code (whether
or not waived)) has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

(b) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Company Benefit Plan that would increase materially the annual
expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred
therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Except as set forth in Section
3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter and except as contemplated by the
Plan of Arrangement (as such may be amended in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement), no Company Benefit Plan or Company Stock Plan exists that
could (i) result in the payment to any Company Employee of any money or other
property, (ii) accelerate or provide any other rights or benefits (including
funding of compensation or benefits through a trust or otherwise) to any
Company Employee, or (iii) limit or restrict the ability of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to merge, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, in each
case, as a result of the execution of this Agreement or otherwise related in
any way to the transactions contemplated hereby; and no such payment would
reasonably be expected to constitute a material parachute payment within the
meaning of Code Section 280G.

material Company Benefit Plans. The Company has made available to Parent true
and complete copies of all material Company Benefit Plans.

Plan is so qualified and each trust established in connection with any Plan
which is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it
is so exempt, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter or letters from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified
status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

(e) Except as has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably believe that they have properly
classified their consultants and independent contractors as non-employees for
purposes of withholding of Taxes, employment Taxes and employment Law, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, and no
circumstances exist under which the Company or any such Subsidiary would
reasonably be expected to incur, any liability arising under the Fair Labor
Standards Act.

(f) All Company Options have been granted in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan and applicable Law. All Stock Options

such grant, except for such failures, if any, to be so granted which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise subject to, any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union
contract. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no organizational effort
currently being made or threatened by, or on behalf of, any labor union to

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has and maintains in full force
and effect, and is in compliance with, all Permits and all orders from
Governmental Authorities necessary for the Company and each Subsidiary to
carry on their respective businesses as currently conducted, except as has not

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as has not had,

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, to the Knowledge of the
Company, each officer, employee, agent, independent contractor or other Person
employed, supervised or controlled by the

necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances in which they are made.



 

31 Section 6.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all
documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary or appropriate filings, consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental Authorities or other
Persons. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and to make, or
cause to be made, the filings and authorizations required under the
Competition Act, the Investment Canada Act or otherwise required under
applicable Law as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
and to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, the
Competition Act, the Investment Canada Act or otherwise under applicable Law
and use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other
actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 6.2 to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, or
receipt of required authorizations or approvals, as applicable, under the HSR
Act, the Competition Act, the Investment Canada Act or as otherwise required
under applicable Law as soon as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing,
the parties shall request and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act.

(b) Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.2(a) to obtain
all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated
hereby, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with
any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Competition Bureau Canada, Industry Canada or any
other Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to
review any filing, submission, communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ, the
Competition Bureau Canada, Industry Canada or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, the Competition
Bureau Canada, Industry Canada or such other applicable Governmental
Authority or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.2(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or if any suit
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ, the
Competition Bureau Canada, Industry Canada or any other applicable
Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Law or which would
otherwise prevent, materially  



 

32  impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including in order to resolve such
objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no party
shall be required to, and the Company may not (without the prior written
consent of Parent), take any such actions to resolve any such objections or
suits which actions would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(d) Subject to the obligations under Section 6.2(c), in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or private party challenging
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement
contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts
to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prevents, materially delays or materially impedes consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as
promptly as reasonably practical after the date of this Agreement, the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in Schedule 6.2(e)(i) from
the investor set forth in Schedule 6.2(e)(ii).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
Parent determines in its reasonable judgment that any approvals
from Governmental Authorities required for the change of control of any of
the premium finance company Subsidiaries of the Company are reasonably likely
not to be received prior to the anticipated Effective Time, or if Parent
determines in its reasonable judgment that applying for or obtaining any of
such approvals will be unduly burdensome to Parent or its Affiliates, then, if
requested by Parent, the Company shall cause the applicable premium finance
company Subsidiaries designated by Parent to surrender their respective
premium finance company licenses and take such additional steps, including the
sale or other transfer of the servicing of, and each such premium finance
company Subsidiarys respective economic interest in, any applicable
outstanding premium finance contracts, all as necessary in the reasonable
judgment of Parent so that any such premium finance company Subsidiary will
not need to be licensed as a premium finance company at the Effective Time in
the jurisdictions designated by Parent. The parties will cooperate and use
their reasonable best effort to give effect to any such license surrenders,
transfers and/or other actions as close in time to the Closing Date as
reasonably practical. 

Section 6.3. _Access to Information_. (a) Subject to applicable Law, the
Company will provide and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to provide Parent and its respective authorized
Representatives, and Parents potential financing sources and their respective
Representatives, upon reasonable advance notice, (i) such access to the
offices, properties, books and records, management and other personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (so long as such access does not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) as Parent
reasonably may request and (ii) all documents that  



 

33  Parent reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, Parents potential financing sources or their respective
Representatives shall have access to any books, records and other information
the disclosure of which (A) would, in the Companys good faith opinion after
consultation with legal counsel, result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege with respect to such books, records and other information; or (B)
would result in the disclosure of any trade secret of a third party or violate
any obligation of the Company to a third party with respect to
confidentiality, if the Company shall have used commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such disclosure. The
parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(b) No investigation by any of the parties or their respective Representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
other parties set forth herein.

(c) All information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.4. _Solicitation_. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date hereof and
continuing until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 19, 2007 (the "No-
Shop Period Start Date"), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents, advisors,
affiliates and other representatives (each of the foregoing, together with the
Subsidiaries of the Company, the "Representatives") shall have the right to
directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage, whether publicly
or otherwise, Company Acquisition Proposals, including by way of providing
access to non-public information or Company Employees pursuant to (but only
pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements (provided that
the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries, and access to any
Company Employees, that is provided to any Person given such access and which
was not previously provided to Parent) and (ii) enter into and maintain
discussions or negotiations with respect to Company Acquisition Proposals or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such
inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or the making of any Company
Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement" shall mean a confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains
provisions which are no less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that,
a confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains a standstill
agreement that is of a duration of not less than one year but less than two
years and provisions which are otherwise no less favorable to the Company in
the aggregate than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to be an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement if the Company promptly
(within one Business Day) acknowledges and agrees in a writing delivered to
Apax Partners, LP that the Confidentiality Agreement has been modified so
that the duration of the standstill provision contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be the same as the duration of the standstill provision
contained in such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

34 (b) Subject to Section 6.4(c), and except as permitted below in this Section
6.4(b) with respect to any Excluded Party, from the No-Shop Period Start Date
until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VIII, none of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives shall, directly or indirectly: (A)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing or
making available information or providing access to its properties, books,
records or personnel) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers
that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect
thereto or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly assist or
participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations, or furnish or disclose to any Person (other than
Parent and its Representatives) any information in connection therewith, (B)
terminate, waive, amend, release, modify or fail to enforce any provision of,
or grant any permission or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or
similar agreement entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of or in contemplation of a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (C)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, a Company
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, amalgamation
agreement, arrangement agreement, plan of arrangement, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
providing for or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach
its obligations hereunder or propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Subject to Section 6.4(c), on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any potential Company
Acquisition Proposals and, if not already so requested, request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to
such Persons or their Representatives; provided, that, with respect to any
Excluded Party, the Company and its Representative may continue to take any of
the actions described in clause (A) above (or clause (B) above solely to the
extent necessary to permit the Company and its Representatives to take the
actions described in clause (A) above) from and after the No-Shop Period Start
Date and prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote. As used herein,
"Excluded Party" means any Person that submitted to the Company prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date a Company Acquisition Proposal (x) for which the
requirements of Section 6.4(c)(i) have been satisfied and (y) that includes
aggregate consideration payable in respect of the Shares, Company Options and
Company RSUs that the Board of Directors has determined in good faith to be of
a comparable level of consideration (regardless of form of consideration) to
the aggregate consideration payable by Parent in respect of such Company
Securities pursuant to the Arrangement; _provided_ , that, if the Company
Acquisition Proposal made by any Excluded Party shall have expired or
been withdrawn as of 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on April 10, 2007, then
from and after such time the Person making such offer shall no longer be
considered to be an Excluded Party for purposes of this Agreement. With
respect to any Person submitting a Company Acquisition Proposal prior to the
No Shop Period Start Date, the Board of Directors of the Company shall make,
in good faith as promptly as practical following (and within 48 hours of) the
No-Shop Period Start Date, a determination as to whether such Person meets
the requirements to be an Excluded Party for purposes of this Agreement.



 

35 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(b), but
subject to Section 6.4(d), if at any time following the date hereof and prior
to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, (i) the Company has received a
written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party not solicited in
violation of this Section 6.4 that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
and (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that the Company (x) will not, and will not allow
its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person
without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will
promptly provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and access to any Company Employees, provided to
such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(b) or this Section 6.4(c),
prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, the Company shall be
permitted to take the actions described in clauses (A) and (B) above with
respect to any Excluded Party.

(d) No later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on March 30, 2007, the
Company shall notify Parent of the number of Excluded Parties (identifying
each Excluded Party as either a strategic or financial acquirer and not by
name) and provide Parent a summary of the material terms and conditions of
each Company Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded Party, including
a description of the material terms of any related proposals made to the
executive officers of the Company in relation to compensation and rollover of
Company Securities. No later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on April 11,
2007, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice identifying the
Excluded Parties by name (together with copies of the written proposals
delivered by such Excluded Parties). The Company shall keep Parent informed on
a current basis (within one Business Day) as to the status and any material
developments, modifications, discussions and negotiations concerning all such
Company Acquisition Proposals from Excluded Parties. From and after 11:59
a.m., New York City time, on April 10, 2007, the Company will provide Parent
copies of all material documents (promptly within one Business Day of
receipt) relating to Company Acquisition Proposal made by Excluded Parties.
From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly
(within one Business Day) notify Parent in the event that the Company or any
of its Representatives receives (i) a Company Acquisition Proposal from a
Person or group of related Persons other than an Excluded Party, (ii) any
request for information relating to any potential Company Acquisition Proposal
other than from an Excluded Party or (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal other
than from an Excluded Party. Any such notice required by the preceding
sentence shall include the identity of the Person making such proposal,
request or inquiry and the material terms and conditions  



 

36  thereof (and shall include a copy of any such written proposal, inquiry or
request, including a description of any related proposals made to the
executive officers of the Company in relation to compensation and rollover of
Company Securities). The Company shall keep Parent informed on a current basis
(within one Business Day) as to the status and any material developments,
modifications, discussions and negotiations concerning the matters referred
to in the two preceding sentences (and shall include a copy of any written
modification or other material documentation relating thereto). Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall promptly (within one Business Day) notify Parent in writing if
it determines to begin providing or making available information or to engage
in negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal received on or
after the No-Shop Period Start Date from a Person or group of related Persons,
other than an Excluded Party, pursuant to Section 6.4(c). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.4, (x) the Company
shall not, and shall not authorize, direct, cause or permit any of its
Representatives to enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement except an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement as permitted or required pursuant to this Section 6.4, and (y) the
Company and its Representatives shall provide confidential information only in
compliance with the requirements of Schedule 6.4(d) and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be party to any agreement that prohibits the Company
from providing or making available to Parent any information provided or made
available to any other Person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement.

(e) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall directly or indirectly (i) modify in a manner adverse to Parent
or withdraw, or publicly propose to modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
withdraw, the Recommendation, (ii) approve or make any recommendation to the
Company Shareholders in connection with any tender offer, take-over bid or
other Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a recommendation against such
offer) or (iii) take any other action in connection with the Company Meeting
or make any other public statement inconsistent with such Recommendation (any
of the actions referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii),
whether taken by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof,
a "Recommendation Withdrawal"); provided, that at any time prior to obtaining
the Requisite Shareholder Vote, if (x) the Company receives a Company
Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in
good faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisors)
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Board of Directors of the Company may (A) make a
Recommendation Withdrawal or (B) terminate this Agreement in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; provided,
however that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 6.4(e), and any purported termination pursuant to this Section 6.4(e)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such
termination the Company pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section
8.2(a); and provided, further, that the Board of Directors may not effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to this Section 6.4(e) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.4(e) unless the Company shall
have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least 72 hours in advance
(the "Notice Period"), of its intention to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal
in response to such Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, which
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior  



 

37  Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior
Proposal), together with a description of any related proposals made to the
executive officers of the Company in relation to compensation and rollover of
Company Securities, and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior
Proposal and other material documents. In the event of any material revisions
to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.4(e) with respect to such new written notice, except that the Notice Period
shall be reduced to 36 hours.

(f) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.4 by any Representative of the Company, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 6.4 by the Company.

(g) As used in this Agreement, the term:

(i) "Company Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act) other than Parent or its Affiliates relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, of a business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues,
net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
20% or more of any class or series of Company Securities, any tender offer,
take-over bid or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
or "group" beneficially owning 20% or more of any class or series of Company
Securities, or any amalgamation, merger, plan of arrangement, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 20% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); and

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determines
would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Company Shareholders (solely in their
capacities as Company Shareholders) than the transactions contemplated hereby
after receiving the advice of a financial advisor (who shall be a nationally
recognized investment banking firm in the United States or Canada) and after
taking into account any other relevant factors permitted by applicable Law
(including the likelihood of obtaining financing and regulatory approval for
such proposal and the likelihood of consummating such proposal);
provided that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the
references to "20% or more" in the definition of Company Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to "a majority".

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or under Canadian Securities Laws or (ii)
making any disclosure to the Company Shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after  



 

38  receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel, such disclosure is
required by applicable Law; provided, that neither the Company nor the Board
of Directors (or any committee thereof) may make a Recommendation Withdrawal
except as permitted by Section 6.4(e).

Section 6.5.  _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall to the greatest extent permitted by Law (and
notwithstanding any limitations in any existing indemnity or similar
agreements or the By-laws of the Company) indemnify and hold harmless (and
comply with all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing obligations
to indemnify and hold harmless, including obligations to advance funds for
expenses) (i) the present and former officers and directors thereof against
any and all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts
paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative ("Damages"), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, the approval of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or
pertaining to the transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) such persons
against any and all Damages arising out of acts or omissions in connection
with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any
entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have purchased, and, following
the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, a tail
policy to the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained on the date hereof by the Company (the "Current Policy"), which
tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through
and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at
the Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same
coverage and amount as, and contain terms and conditions no
less advantageous, in the aggregate, than the coverage currently provided by
the Current Policy; provided, that the Company shall not be required to pay
any amounts in respect of such coverage prior to the Effective Time and
provided, further that the cost of such tail policy shall not exceed 300% of
the Companys current annual premium for its Current Policy (which the Company
represents and warrants to be $823,700 (the "Current Premium") (it being
understood that if the cost of such tail policy would exceed 300% of the
Current Premium then the Company shall purchase a tail policy that contains
the highest level of coverage that can be obtained for such amount). Subject
to the foregoing limitations, Parent agrees to pay, or cause to be paid, the
premium in respect of such tail policy on a timely basis following the
Effective Time.

(c) This Section 6.5 shall survive the consummation of the Arrangement and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their
respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Parent or the Company, as applicable, and their successors and assigns. In the
event that the Parent or the Company, as applicable, or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or  



 

39  surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Parent or the Company, as applicable, assume and honor the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.5.

(d) The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or former director or
officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release,
waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 6.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any
such policies.

Section 6.6.  _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any
Recommendation Withdrawal or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance
with, Section 6.4 or Article VIII, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the
parties will consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public statement as
may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the New York
Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the consent of the other
parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

Section 6.7. _Employee Matters_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time ("Current
Employee") may have under any Company Benefit Plan, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain
for each Current Employee (i) his or her salary or hourly wage
rate, commission structure and opportunities, and/or target cash bonus
opportunities under annual programs (collectively, "Compensation"), that in
the aggregate are no less favorable than the Compensation and benefits, as
applicable, maintained for and provided to such Current Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) severance, retirement and welfare
benefits provided under the Company Benefit Plans that in the aggregate are no
less favorable than the Compensation and benefits, as applicable, maintained
for and provided to such Current Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that subject to Section 6.7(c), nothing herein shall
prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plans or
interfere with Parents or Companys right or obligation to make such changes
as (i) are necessary to conform with applicable Law or (ii) are approved by
the chief executive officer of the Company. Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall
limit the right of Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate
the employment of any Current Employee at any time in a manner consistent with
any applicable Laws and any applicable Company Benefit Plan.



 

40 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to, give each Current Employee full credit for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes,
except for purposes of vacation and severance) under any Employee Benefit
Plans and any other employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit
(including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements, in each case
maintained for the benefit of Current Employees as of and after the Effective
Time by Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Plan") for
such Current Employees service prior to the Effective Time with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities, to the same extent such
service is recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time under comparable plans. With respect to each Parent Plan
that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and any
other similar plan (whether or not subject to ERISA), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) cause there to be waived any
pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations or exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements with respect to the Current Employees and their
eligible dependents and (ii) give effect, for the year in which the Closing
occurs, for purposes of satisfying any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, Current Employees and their eligible dependents under similar plans
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries in which such Current Employees
and their eligible dependents participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor, in accordance with
their respective terms, (i) each existing employment, change in control,
severance and termination plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any officer, director or
employee of that company, on the other hand, (ii) each bonus plan, program or
agreement and (iii) all obligations pursuant to existing benefit restoration
plans, equity-based plans, programs or agreements, bonus plans, programs or
agreements, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits under any
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and
agreements in effect as of the Effective Time, in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), to the extent legally binding on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on and
after the date of execution of this Agreement, the Company shall not make
any matching or discretionary contribution to its 401(k) plan in the form of
Shares and, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to effectuate the removal of the investment fund that holds
Shares from such plan. In addition, (A) nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Company to grant, following the Effective Time, any equity or
equity-related compensation to any employee under any equity plan and (B) the
Company shall take all actions necessary so that the Company Stock Plans, and
the provisions in any other Company Benefit Plan providing for the issuance,
transfer or grant of any Shares or other Company Securities or any interest in
respect of any Shares or other Company Securities shall be deleted as of the
Effective Time, and the Company shall take such actions necessary to ensure
that, after the Effective Time, no participant in any Company Stock Plan or
other Company Benefit Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any
Shares or Company Securities or any interest in respect of any capital stock
or other equity securities of the Company or any affiliate thereof (except for
rights of holders of Company Options and Company RSUs issued under the
terms of any Company Plan prior the date hereof that are legally enforceable
as of the date hereof).



 

41 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are for the sole benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any Company Employees), other than the parties hereto and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or
other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this
Section 6.7) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 6.8. _Financing_.

(a) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII,
the Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives,
including legal and accounting, to provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including
(i) participation on a timely basis in meetings, presentations, road shows,
due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies,
(ii) assisting Parent and its financing sources with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses, offering
circulars and similar documents required in connection with the Debt
Financing; provided that any private placement memoranda or prospectuses in
relation to high yield debt securities need not be issued by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and
security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company
or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents of accountants
for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing) and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral (including
obtaining third party consents and estoppels), in each case effective on or
after the Effective Time, (iv) furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing
sources as promptly as practicable with all financial statements, pro forma
financial information, financial data, audit reports and other information
regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
businesses and properties as required in the Debt Financing Commitments, as
are customary for the financings contemplated thereby and as may otherwise be
reasonably requested by Parent, including all financial statements and
financial data of the type and form, and for all periods, required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act for registered
offerings of debt securities and of the type and form, and for all periods,
customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities
Act to consummate the offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments at the time during the Companys fiscal year such
offerings will be made, together with all other financial and other
information required for the underwriters, placement agents or initial
purchasers in connection with the Debt Financing to receive customary comfort
from the Companys accountants on the information contained in any offering
document, private placement memorandum, prospectus or similar document,
including customary negative assurances comfort and change period comfort
(the information referred to in this clause (iv),



 

42  the "Required Financial Information"), (v) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain accountants comfort letters and legal opinions as reasonably
requested by Parent, (vi) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A)
permit the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the
Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing
collateral arrangements and (B) effective on or after the Effective Time,
establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing, and (vii) taking all corporate
actions, and other actions that are reasonably requested by Parent and within
the control of the Company or its Subsidiaries, to satisfy any requirements
necessary to consummate the Debt Financing and the direct borrowing or
incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Debt Financing, including any high
yield debt financing, by the Parent or the Company, as applicable, immediately
following the Effective Time; provided that the corporate actions described
in clause (vii) shall be taken subject to the occurrence of the Closing; and
provided, further that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay prior to the Effective Time any commitment or other similar
fee or incur any other cost or expense in connection with the Debt Financing
that is not promptly (within three Business Days of delivery of reasonably
acceptable documentation evidencing such cost or expense) reimbursed by
Parent. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation (such
reimbursement to be made promptly and in any event within three Business Days
of delivery of reasonably acceptable documentation evidencing such expenses)
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information
provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries). The Company hereby consents to
the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt
Financing, provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and its or their marks. All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.8(a) shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that Parent and its
Representatives shall be permitted to disclose information as necessary and
consistent with customary practices in connection with the Debt Financing so
long as Parent and its Representatives reasonably cooperate with the Company
in order to permit the Company to comply with its obligations under applicable
Law relating to the disclosure of such confidential information.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions in the Debt Financing Commitments as promptly as
practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained therein or on other terms no less favorable to Parent and (ii) to
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such
definitive agreements that are within its control. In the event that all
conditions to the Financing Commitments (other than in connection with the
Debt Financing, the availability or funding of any of the Equity Financing)
have been satisfied in Parents good faith judgment, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing
such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the Arrangement
on the Closing Date.  



 

43  In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms no less favorable to Parent (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. For purposes of Section 6.8, the term
"Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include any such alternative financing so
obtained or arranged by Parent and the term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall
be deemed to include any commitment with respect to such alternative
financing to the extent such commitment is then in effect. Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating to the
Financing.

(c) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other material provision under the
Financing Commitments without the consent of the Company if such amendments,
modifications or waivers would impose any new or additional condition or
otherwise amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing, in each case in a manner that would be reasonably likely to cause
any material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
VII (it being understood that Parent may, without the consent of the Company,
amend, restate, modify, supplement or replace the Debt Financing Commitments
to add and appoint additional arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, agents,
lenders and similar entities, to provide for the assignment and reallocation
of a portion of the financing commitments. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, one or more Debt Financing Commitments may be
superseded at the option of Parent after the date hereof but prior to the
Effective Time by new debt financing commitments (the "New Financing
Commitments") which replace existing Debt Financing Commitments; provided,
that the terms of the New Financing Commitments shall not (A) impose new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Financing as set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitments in any material respect or (B) be reasonably
likely to cause any material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article VII. In such event, the term "Financing Commitments" as used
in this Section 6.8 shall be deemed to include the Financing Commitments that
are not so superseded at the time in question and the New Financing
Commitments to the extent then in effect and the term "Debt Financing" as used
in this Section 6.8 shall be deemed to also include the financing
contemplated by the New Financing Commitments.

(d) In no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of
this Section 6.8(d) shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect
investor or potential investor in Parent, or any of Parents or any such
investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other
Representatives) (i) award any agent, broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other firm or Person except Morgan Stanley and Co., Incorporated any
financial advisory role on an exclusive basis (or until the No-Shop Period
Start Date, any additional firm or Person on a non-exclusive basis), or (ii)
engage any bank or investment bank or other provider of financing other than
Morgan Stanley and Co., Incorporated and its Affiliates on an exclusive basis
(or otherwise on terms that could reasonably be expected to prevent such
provider from providing or seeking to provide financing to any third party in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries), in
the case of clauses (i) and (ii) in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided, however, following the No-Shop Period Start
Date, Parent may engage one additional provider of debt financing and one  



 

44  additional financial advisor, in each case, on an exclusive basis. Until the
No-Shop Period Start Date, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
seek or obtain any equity commitments or equity financing in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or provide any information in respect
thereof to any potential investor in Parent, or any of Parents or any such
investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other
Representatives who have not been provided any such information prior to the
date hereof. Parent shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the foregoing
covenant.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.8(d) or anything in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, Parent and its respective Affiliates may enter
into discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understanding with respect to
equity financing or equity financing commitments in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Person listed on Schedule
6.8(e) (or an Affiliate thereof), and provide information in connection
therewith. No action shall be taken pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence that would violate the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.9. _Actions with Respect to Existing Debt_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the receipt by the Company of a written request by Parent
(and a reasonable period of time in advance of the anticipated Closing Date,
as determined by Parent), the Company shall, in accordance with the directions
of Parent, promptly cause Hub International Limited Partnership, a Delaware
limited partnership and wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (the "Existing
Notes Issuer"), to assist Parent or one or more of its Affiliates in the
commencement of third party offers to purchase (or commence cash offers to
purchase, in the event that a tender offer by the Existing Notes Issuer is
deemed by Parent in its reasonable discretion to be materially advantageous as
compared to a third party tender offer) and/or consent solicitations with
respect to the Existing Notes Issuers outstanding (a) 5.71% Series A Senior
Notes due April 4, 2011, (b) 6.16% Series B Senior Notes due June 15, 2013 and
(c) 6.43% Senior Notes due April 4, 2016 (the notes referred to in clause
(a), (b) and (c) being referred to herein as the "Existing Notes") in order
to effect the repurchase or prepayment of the Existing Notes at, but subject
to and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Closing, all on the terms and
conditions specified by Parent. Each such offer to purchase and/or consent
solicitation shall be structured at the direction of Parent in a manner so as
to best accommodate the Debt Financing and the other transactions provided for
herein and in the Plan of Arrangement. In connection therewith, the Company
shall cause the Existing Notes Issuer to take all actions, deliver all
notices, certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents and execute and
deliver all agreements and instruments as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or required by the terms of the Existing Notes (or the related note
purchase agreements and other documents governing the Existing Notes). In
addition, in the event Parent has determined in its sole discretion to
discharge any other existing Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries
on the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent, in order to take all
actions necessary to effect a satisfaction and discharge of such Indebtedness
and termination of related agreement and to obtain on a basis reasonably
satisfactory to Parent "payoff letters" and lien release documentation in
connection therewith. Parent shall (i) promptly (and in any event within
three Business Days of delivery of reasonably acceptable documentation
evidencing such costs and expenses) reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries
in complying with this Section 6.9; and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its



 

45  Subsidiaries from and against any and all losses, damages, claims and
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with taking the actions
required by this Section 6.9 and any information utilized in connection
therewith, except to the extent that such losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses, directly or indirectly, resulted from or arose out of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 6.10. _Confidentiality Agreement_. Parent acknowledges on behalf of
its Affiliates, Representatives and each investor in Parent that Parent, its
Affiliates, their respective Representatives and each investor in Parent is
bound by and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if each
such person was a party to the Confidentiality Agreement, and the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not in any manner modify
or limit the Companys rights under such agreement. Parent shall cause its
Affiliates, their respective Representatives and each investor in Parent to
comply with the foregoing covenant.

Section 6.11. _Management_. In no event shall Parent or any of its
Affiliates, Representatives or investors in Parent enter into any arrangements
with any member of the Companys management or any other Company Employee that
prohibit or restrict such member of management or such Company Employee from
discussing, negotiating or entering into, any arrangements with any third
party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries or seek to do so; provided that this Section 6.11 does not
prohibit the entering into of any rollover agreements in substantially the
form previously provided to the Company. Parent shall cause its Affiliates,
Representatives and each investor in Parent to comply with the foregoing
covenant.

Section 6.12. _Section 16(b)_. The Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.13 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of any litigation
brought or threatened against the Company or its directors by or on behalf of
any holders of Shares, Company Options or Company RSUs relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company
shall not agree to any such settlement without Parents prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

and that any terms and conditions attached to any such advice shall be
acceptable to Parent acting reasonably and either the Commissioner shall have

hereby; provided, that representations made as of a specific date shall be
required to be so true and correct (subject to such qualifications) as of such
date only.

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall have performed in all

Arrangement and other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned
at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any prior approval
of the Arrangement by the Company Shareholders):



     | (a) | by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; 
---|---|--- 



 

48 ---|---|--- 

(i) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on September 7, 2007 (the "End Date") unless the failure of
the Effective Time to occur by such time is the result of, or caused by,
the failure of the party seeking to exercise such termination right to
perform or observe any of the covenants or agreements of such party set forth
in this Agreement; provided, that Parent may extend the End Date to the last
day of the Marketing Period, if the Marketing Period has commenced and such
last day of the Marketing Period would be a later date and the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) until the
expiration of the Marketing Period;

shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement is the principal cause of or resulted in the application or
imposition of such Restraint; or

satisfied, and such breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date or has
not been cured prior to the 30th day after the giving of written notice
thereof by the Company to Parent; provided, however, that the Company is not
then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1, 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied; or

(ii) prior to obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Vote, in order to enter into
an definitive acquisition agreement relating to a Superior Proposal in

49 (ii) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than its obligations
under Sections 6.1 or 6.4) shall have occurred which would cause any of the

breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date or has not been cured
prior to the 30th day after the giving of written notice thereof by Parent to

7.3(a) or 7.3(b) not to be satisfied; or

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (A)

to Section 8.1(d)(i) or 8.1(d)(iii), then the Company shall pay the
Termination Fee as directed in writing by Parent, at or prior to the time of
termination in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or as
promptly as possible (but in any event within two Business Days) following
termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant
to Section 8.1(d)(i) or 8.1(d)(iii).

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company,
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) (or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a
different section of Section 8.1 at a time when this Agreement was terminable
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i)) or pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) (or is
terminated by the Company pursuant to a different section of Section 8.1 at a
time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) (or is terminated by the Company
pursuant to a different section of Section 8.1 at a time when this Agreement
was terminable pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)) and, at any time after the date
hereof and prior to the End Date (in the case of a termination pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i)), after the date hereof and prior to the Company Meeting
(in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)) or after the
date hereof and prior to the breach giving rise to the right of termination
(in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)), a bona fide,
written Company Acquisition Proposal involving the purchase of not less than a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company shall have been
(x) publicly announced or publicly made known, in the case of termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) and not publicly withdrawn at least two
Business Days prior to the Company Meeting or (y) made known to the Company or
publicly announced or publicly made known, in the case of termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) or Section 8.1(d)(ii) and not withdrawn at least
two Business Days prior to the End Date (in the case of a termination pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i)) or the occurrence of the breach giving rise to the
right of termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii)), and, if within twelve months after such termination pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i), Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(ii) the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries  



 

50  enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, such
Company Acquisition Proposal involving the purchase of not less than a
majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Company (whether or not
the same as that originally announced or consummated), then, on the date of
such execution or consummation, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee as
directed in writing to Parent, less the amount of any Parent Expenses
previously paid to Parent by the Company.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) (or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a
different section of Section 8.1 at a time when this Agreement was terminable
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii)) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii)
(or is terminated by the Company pursuant to a different section of Section
8.1 hereof at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(ii)) but only under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not
payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall pay as promptly as
possible (but in any event within two Business Days) following receipt of an
invoice therefor all of Parents actual and reasonably documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses and
fees and expenses of accountants, financial advisors, consultants, lenders and
other agents and advisors) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates
on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and the related financing transactions
("Parent Expenses") as directed by Parent in writing, which amount shall not
be greater than $6.0 million; provided, that the existence of circumstances
which could require the Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall not relieve the Company of its
obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.2(c);
provided, further, that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant
to this Section 8.2(c) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) except to
the extent indicated in Section 8.2(b); and provided, further, that if the
Company has paid the Parent Expenses and is subsequently required to pay the
Termination Fee, the Termination Fee shall be reduced by the amount of Parent
Expenses previously paid by the Company.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
(i) Section 8.1(b)(i) (or is terminated by the Parent pursuant to a different
section of Section 8.1 at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(i)) and at the time of such termination the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) have been satisfied, or (ii) Section
8.1(c)(i) (or is terminated by Parent pursuant to a different section of
Section 8.1 at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(i)) and at the time of such termination there is no state of facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) not to be satisfied on or prior to
the End Date, then Parent shall pay the Company the Termination Fee as
promptly as possible (but in any event within two Business Days) following
such termination by the Company.

(e) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 8.2(a), 8.2(b), 8.2(c)
or 8.2(d) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the party entitled to receive such payment.

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and  



 

51  that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 8.2 do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay as
directed in writing by Parent any amounts due to accounts designated by Parent
pursuant to this Section 8.2 within the time periods specified in this Section
8.2 or Parent fails to pay the Company any amounts due to the accounts
designated by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2 within the time periods
specified in this Section 8.2, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay
the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
incurred by Parent or the Company, as applicable, in connection with any
action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Companys
right to receive payment of a Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to this
Section 8.2 or from the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantees shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company, its Affiliates and its
Subsidiaries against Parent, the Guarantors and any of their respective
former, current, or future general or limited partners, stockholders,
managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents (or any other
Related Persons (as defined in Section 3 of the Guarantees)) with respect to
this Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement or any agreement or document referred
to in this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated, under any theory or for any reason,
and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, the Guarantors or any of
their respective former, current, or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents (or
any other Related Persons (as defined in Section 3 of the Guarantees)) shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement, any agreement or document referred to in
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (except
that Parent shall also be obligated with respect to the second sentence of
Section 8.2(f)).

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but except as
provided in Section 9.12 with respect to equitable remedies, Parents right to
receive payment of a Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.2 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and its
Affiliates for money damages against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective former, current, or future shareholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates or agents with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including for any loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated,
under any theory or for any reason, and upon payment of such amount, none of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current, or
future shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that the Company
shall also be obligated with respect to the second sentence of Section
8.2(f)).

Section 8.3. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there
shall be no liability  



 

52  or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent, or their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except that the Guarantees referred to in Section
4.8, the indemnification and reimbursement provisions of the third to last
sentence of Section 6.8(a), the last sentence of Section 6.9 and second to
last sentence of Section 9.5, and the provisions of Section 6.3(c), Sections
8.2 and 8.3 and Article IX will survive the termination hereof; provided,
however, that, subject to Sections 8.2(g) and (h), nothing herein shall
relieve a party from liabilities for Damages incurred or suffered by the other
party as a result of any willful and material breach by such party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3, as applicable, not to be
satisfied.

or such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify
by notice to the other parties hereto. Each such notice, request or other
communication shall be effective (i) on the day of sending, if sent by
facsimile prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on any Business Day or the
next succeeding Business Day if sent by facsimile after 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on any Business Day or on any day other than a Business Day or (ii)
if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this
Section 9.1.

Section 9.2. _Non-Survival_. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, except
for those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein which by their
terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time and then only to such
extent. Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement,
(a) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties
relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) no person has been authorized
by any party to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its
businesses or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be
relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates,
projections, predictions, data, financial information,
memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or
addressed to any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be
deemed to be or to include representations or warranties unless any such
materials or information is expressly the subject of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement.

Section 9.3. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Sections
6.8, 6.9 and 8.2, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

Section 9.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the
Arrangement by the Company Shareholders; provided, however, that after
approval of the Arrangement by the Company  



 

55  Shareholders, no amendment may be made which under applicable Law requires
the further approval of the Company Shareholders without such further
approval. Subject to Section 9.5, this Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

Section 9.5. _Certain Proposed Structure Modifications_. In addition to the
transactions contemplated in the Plan of Arrangement as of the date hereof,
Parent may from time to time hereafter propose to the Company modifications
to the steps, actions and transactions that constitute the Arrangement as set
forth in the Plan of Arrangement or propose additional steps, actions or
transactions as part of or in connection with the Arrangement, in each case,
as necessary to achieve a Canadian tax "bump" under paragraph 88(1)(d) of the
Income Tax Act (Canada) or as otherwise necessary to achieve a structure for
the Arrangement that Parent deems to be optimal under the circumstances for
its tax planning and financing purposes ("Proposed Structure Modifications").
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in the
implementation of any Proposed Structure Modifications and the Plan of
Arrangement shall be amended accordingly, in each case, to the extent the
same (A) does not reduce the amounts of cash payable to the holders of Shares,
Company Options and Company RSUs pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement and (B)
are to be completed immediately prior to, contemporaneously with, or subject
to, or after, the Effective Time. If the Company effects any such Proposed
Structure Modifications at the request of Parent prior to the Effective Time,
and the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, Parent shall
indemnify the Company and its Representatives for any costs, expenses and
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) resulting therefrom and from steps taken
to restore the Company and its Subsidiaries to the same position they were in
immediately prior to the implementation of any Proposed Structure
Modifications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.5,
Parent shall not propose, and the Company shall not be required to assist
Parent in the implementation of, any Proposed Structure Modifications if such
(x) would require recirculation of the Company Proxy Statement after it has
been mailed to Company Shareholder or (y) would otherwise reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and, in the case of each of (x) and
(y) as a result thereof, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby would no longer reasonably be expected to be consummated prior to the
End Date.

Section 9.6. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party hereto
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained for the benefit of such party contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The
failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights or remedies.

Section 9.7. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the consent of the other party hereto (and any



 

56  purported assignment without such consent shall be void and without effect),
except that Parent may assign all or any of its rights and obligations
hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent; provided, however, that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.8. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL ACTIONS ARISING IN WHOLE
OR PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION HEREWITH SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED,
PERFORMED, GOVERNED AND ENFORCED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAW RULES THAT
WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW (EXCEPT FOR THE MATTERS SUBJECT
TO OR CONTEMPLATED BY THE CBCA (INCLUDING THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF
THE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY (WHETHER STATUTORY OR AT COMMON LAW OR EQUITY)
AND THE PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT), WHICH SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED,
PERFORMED, GOVERNED AND ENFORCED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CBCA AND/OR THE
LAWS OF THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO AND FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE THEREIN).

Section 9.9. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective only when actually signed by each party
hereto and each such party has received counterparts hereof signed by the
other party hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder or with respect hereto, except as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 6.5, and except that the Guarantors and the Related
Persons are express beneficiaries of and may enforce Section 8.2(g).

Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any Law, or
due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including to the extent
referred to herein, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Financing Commitments
and the Guarantees) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto
with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all oral or written prior
agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject
matter. In entering into this Agreement no party is relying upon any promise,
statement or representation made by or on behalf of any party except as
expressly set forth herein.

Section 9.12.  _Equitable Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur, monetary damages would be difficult to
determine and would be an  



 

57  insufficient remedy and no other adequate remedy would exist at law or in
equity, in each case in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached by the Company (or the Company threatens such a
breach). It is accordingly agreed that in the event of a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement by the Company, Parent shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Company
irrevocably waives any defenses based on adequacy of any other remedy, whether
at law or in equity, that might be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific
performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof or injunctive relief in
any action brought therefor by Parent. The Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions against Parent to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 

Section 9.13. _Jurisdiction_.

(a) The parties hereby irrevocably submit, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
New York and the Federal courts of the United States of America, in each case
located in Manhattan, in respect of any action, suit or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, the documents referred to in this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for such matters that
are exclusively subject to the jurisdiction of a Canadian provincial court
pursuant to the CBCA or the terms of the Interim Order, the Final Order or the
Arrangement), and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense, by
motion or otherwise, in any such action, suit or proceeding that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced
in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that it is the
intention of each such party that all claims with respect to such action, suit
or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a New York State or
Federal court.

(b) Parent agrees (i) that within 2 Business Days from the date hereof, it
shall irrevocably appoint Corporation Service Company 80 State Street,
Albany, New York 12207-2543 ("CSC") (or such other Person reasonably
acceptable to the Company), as its authorized agent upon whom process may be
served in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby which may be instituted in
any New York State court or any Federal court of the United States sitting in
Manhattan and (ii) that service of process upon such authorized agent shall
be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon Parent in any
such action, suit or proceeding.

(c) The Company agrees (i) that within 2 Business Days from the date hereof,
it shall irrevocably appoint CSC (or such other Person reasonably acceptable
to Parent), as its authorized agent upon whom process may be served in any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby which may be instituted in any New York
State court or any Federal court of the United States sitting in Manhattan and
(ii) that service of process upon such authorized agent shall be deemed in
every respect effective service of process upon the Company in any such
action, suit or proceeding.



 

58 (d) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.13.

Section 9.14. _Authorship_. The parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that
any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

2 ARTICLE 2

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

OF THE SHAREHOLDER

The Shareholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

2.1. Valid Existence

The Shareholder is duly organized, validly subsisting under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation.

2.2. Authority Relative To This Agreement

The Shareholder has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and
validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Shareholder, enforceable against
the Shareholder in accordance with its terms.

2.3. No Conflict



     | (a) | The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Shareholder do not, the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
(i) conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or
decree applicable to the Shareholder or (ii) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under contract to which the Shareholder is a party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Shareholder do not, and the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any court or arbitrator or any
governmental entity, agency or official, except for applicable requirements of
the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  
---|---|--- 

2.4. Ownership Of Shares

As of the date hereof, the Shareholder is the beneficial owner (within the
meaning provided in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the United States Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended _)_ of the Owned Shares set forth
opposite the Shareholders name on Schedule A hereto, free and clear of all
pledges, liens, proxies, claims, charges, security interests, preemptive
rights, voting trusts, voting agreements, options, rights of first offer or
refusal and any other encumbrances or arrangements whatsoever with respect to
the ownership, transfer or other voting of the Owned Shares, other than as
created by this Agreement. Shareholder does not beneficially own or exercise
control or direction over, directly or indirectly, any securities of the
Company except as set out in Schedule A hereto. Other than as provided in this
Agreement, Shareholder is not, and no Subsidiary of the Shareholder that owns
any Covered Securities is, currently obligated to grant and  



 

3  none of them has granted or has outstanding, any proxy in respect of any of
the Owned Shares and none of them has entered into any voting trust, vote
pooling or other agreement with respect to the right to vote, call meetings
of shareholders or give consents or approvals of any kind as to the Owned
Shares. None of the Owned Shares held by the Shareholder or any such
Subsidiary is the subject of any commitment, undertaking or agreement, the
terms of which would affect in any way the ability of such Shareholder or any
such Subsidiary to perform its, his or her obligations as set out in this
Agreement or, once acquired by Parent, affect the ability of Parent to vote
or otherwise enjoy full rights of ownership thereof. As of the date hereof, no
proceedings are pending which, if adversely determined, will have an adverse
effect on any ability to vote or dispose of any of the Covered Securities.
None of the Shareholder or any Subsidiary of the Shareholder that owns any
Owned Securities has appointed or granted any proxy inconsistent with this
Agreement with respect to the Covered Securities. All Owned Shares are owned
directly by Shareholder, or indirectly through Subsidiaries of Shareholder as
set forth on Schedule A hereto.

2.5. Shareholder Has Adequate Information 

The Shareholder is a sophisticated investor with respect to the Covered
Securities and has independently and without reliance upon Parent and based
on such information as the Shareholder has deemed appropriate, made its own
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the
Shareholder has full knowledge of and access to information concerning
the Company and its Shares. Any factors peculiar to the Shareholder,
including non-financial factors, that were considered relevant by the
Shareholder in assessing the consideration offered under the Arrangement did
not have the effect of reducing the consideration that would otherwise have
been considered acceptable by the Shareholder. The Shareholder acknowledges
that, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms, the agreements contained herein with respect to the Covered Securities
by the Shareholder are irrevocable.

2.6. Reliance

The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the
Arrangement Agreement in reliance upon the Shareholders execution and
delivery of this Agreement.

or permit any Subsidiary of the Shareholder to, (i) grant any proxies or enter
into any voting trust or other agreement or arrangement with respect to the
voting of any Covered Securities or (ii) sell, pledge,  



 

4  assign, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of (including by merger,
consolidation or otherwise by operation of law), or enter into any contract,
option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the direct or

appropriate Subsidiaries of Shareholder that own Covered Securities) and
Parent shall deliver joint written instructions to the Company and to the
Companys transfer agent stating that, unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Owned Shares may not be sold,
transferred, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, tendered or otherwise disposed
of in any manner without the prior written consent of Parent or except in

Securities are acquired after the date hereof by the Shareholder or a
Subsidiary thereof, the foregoing instructions shall be delivered upon
acquisition of such Covered Securities. 

3.2. Dissent Rights

Subsidiary thereof to) exercise any rights of dissent provided under the
Arrangement, any applicable laws (including the _Canadian Business
Corporations Act_ ) or otherwise in connection with the approval of the
Arrangement or any other corporate transaction considered at the Company
Meeting.

3.3. Notification

5  taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the Company and Parent in doing, all things necessary, proper

possible, the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by the
Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement, and to carry out the
intents and purposes of this Agreement. Subject to Section 3.8(b)(ii), the
Shareholder agrees that it shall not enter into any agreement or understanding
or make any commitment with any person that would violate any provision or
agreement contained in this Agreement. 

3.7. Post Transaction Ownership

Schedule "B-1" in respect of Sponsor 1 and Schedule "B-2" in respect of
Sponsor 2 attached hereto (those persons identified on Schedule B-1 and
Schedule B-2 together, the "Sponsor Related Parties").

(b) From and after the date hereof, and for a period of 24 months following
the Effective Date, Shareholder shall, and Shareholder shall cause any person
to whom the Shareholder is "related" (within the meaning of subsection 251(2)
of the Income Tax Act (Canada) the "ITA" as it currently reads) and in
respect of which the Shareholder owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of
the voting shares (such "related" person being a "Related Person") to use
commercially reasonable efforts not to (A) own, purchase or acquire, directly
or indirectly an Investment in any of Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries
listed on Schedule "C" attached hereto, Sponsor 1, Sponsor 2, or the Sponsor
Related Parties or (B) make any Investment in an Affiliate of Parent that has
made a direct or indirect Investment in Parent provided that such Affiliate
has been identified by Parent in written notice (the "Notice") to the
attention of Shareholder received at least four weeks prior to the date on
which the Shareholder or a Related Person otherwise intended to make the
Investment in such Affiliate.

(c) Notwithstanding section 3.7(b), it is acknowledged and agreed that an
investment in the securities of a corporation any class of which are listed on
a stock exchange or otherwise publicly traded (excluding, for a period of 12
months following the Effective Date, the acquisition of shares of Morgan
Stanley by the persons listed in Schedule "D") will be permitted and shall not
be treated as a contravention of section 3.7(b).

(d) Shareholder has no knowledge that a Related Person owns or has the
intention as of the date hereof to acquire shares of Morgan Stanley.

 

(e) An investment in an Affiliate of Parent will not be treated as a breach of

Parent at the time of investment and the Person subsequently merged,
amalgamated or combined with a Person that was or became identified in a
Notice. 



 

6 (f) This representation and covenant will be of no force or effect if an
advance tax ruling is not issued to Parent by Canada Revenue Agency in
respect of paragraph 88(1)(d) of the ITA other than for breach of section 3.7.

(g) The Parent covenants that it will advise the Shareholder of the status of
the advance ruling application on a timely basis.

(h) Parent agrees that if it makes a payment to any person for providing the
same or similar representation and covenant as received in this section 3.7,
it shall forthwith make a payment to the Shareholder on a proportionate basis
that its direct or indirect ownership of Shares bears to that direct or
indirect ownership of Shares by the other person that received the payment.

3.8. Non-Solicitation

(a) Shareholder covenants and agrees (on behalf of itself and its
Representatives):

(i) to immediately cease or cause to be terminated any existing solicitation
by the Shareholder with any Persons which could reasonably be expected
to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal;

representative, advisor or agent, make, solicit, initiate, facilitate,

constituting or that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or a change of control of the Company or would or could,
in any case, result in the sale or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company, provided however, that this should not
prevent an employee or officer of Shareholder or any Subsidiary thereof if a
director or officer of the Company to fulfill his or her fiduciary
obligations.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above or elsewhere in
this Agreement, in no event shall the provisions of this Agreement:

(i) restrict (or be deemed to restrict or otherwise apply to) the actions of
any individual serving on the Board of Directors of the Company, regardless of
whether such individual is also an officer, director, employee or other
representative of the Shareholder;

Agreement.

(c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any
condition to its own obligations contained herein, provided that the
Shareholder may not waive compliance with, or any condition under, the
Arrangement Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

4.9. Parties in Interest

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any

foregoing, this provision shall not apply to any breach of Section 3.7., for

PAYMENT

4.1 Delivery of Cash

At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Depositary, for the benefit of each Company Shareholder, the cash, in
United States dollars, to which each such Company Shareholder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1(h) upon the transfer of the Shares to Parent. Upon
surrender by a Company Shareholder to the Depositary of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more Shares,
together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and any
other documents reasonably requested by Parent and the Depositary (or, if such
Shares are held in bookentry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry
through a bookentry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares on a
bookentry account statement (it being understood that any references herein
to "certificates" shall be deemed to include references to bookentry
account statements relating to the ownership of Shares)), the Holder of such
surrendered certificate(s) of Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such Company Shareholder, as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, a cheque issued by the
Depositary (or other form of immediately available funds) representing that
amount of cash which such Company Shareholder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.5.
In addition, the Company shall deliver to each Holder of Cashed-out Options
and Cashed-out RSUs, forthwith after the Effective Time, a cheque issued by
the Company (or other form of immediately available funds) representing that
amount of cash which such Holder of Cashed-out Options and Cashed-out RSUs has
the right to receive, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.5. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a cheque representing the proper amount of
cash (or other form of immediately available funds) may be delivered to the
transferee if the certificate representing such Shares is surrendered to the
Depositary, accompanied by a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.1, each certificate of
Shares (excluding Rollover Shares) shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a
cash payment in the manner contemplated by this Section 4.1, less any amounts
withheld pursuant to Section 4.5. The provisions contained in the Rollover
Agreement prevail over this Section 4.1 with respect to the securities of the
Company subject to such Rollover Agreement. Any portion of the amount
deposited with the Depositary (including any interest and other income
resulting from any investment of the Depositary with respect to such amount)
that remains unclaimed by the Holders and other eligible Persons in accordance
with this Article 4 following 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Company, and any Holder who has not previously complied
with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to the Company for, and,
subject to Section 4.4, the Company shall remain liable for, payment of such
Holders claim for payment under this Section 4.1.



 

\- 9 - 4.2 Distributions with respect to Unsurrendered Certificates

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1. At the time of such surrender of any such
certificate, there shall be paid to the Holder of the certificates
representing Shares, without interest, the amount of cash to which such Holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1.

4.3 Lost Certificates

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Shares that were transferred pursuant to
Section 3.1 is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, a cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
for the cash amount, deliverable in accordance with such Holders Letter of
Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom cash is to be delivered shall, as
a condition precedent to the payment thereof, give a bond satisfactory to
Parent and the Company and their respective transfer agents in such sum as
Parent and the Company may direct or otherwise indemnify Parent and the
Company in a manner satisfactory to Parent and the Company against any claim
that may be made against Parent or the Company with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

4.4 Extinction of Rights

Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that were transferred pursuant to Section 3.1, and not
deposited, with all other instruments required by Section 4.1, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim
or interest of any kind or nature as a shareholder of the Company or for the
receipt of cash. On such date, the cash to which the former Holder of the
certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled
shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to Parent. None
of Parent or the Company shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. In addition, in the event of the surrender of a
certificate of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company under the name of the Person surrendering such certificate, the amount
of cash to which the registered Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.1
shall be paid to such a transferee if such certificate is presented to the
Depositary and such certificate is duly endorsed or is accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes or any other Taxes required by reason of
such payments being made in a name other than the registered Holder have been
paid. If any amount of cash to which the registered Holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.1 is to be delivered to a Person whose name is other
than that in which the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the
Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required to be paid by reason of such delivery to a Person whose name is other
than that of the Holder of the certificate surrendered or shall establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.



 

\- 10 - 4.5 Withholding Rights

Parent, the Company or the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable to any Holder of Shares or Company Options or
Company RSUs pursuant to Section 3.1, such amounts as Parent, the Company
or the Depositary reasonably determines is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payment under the ITA, the Code or any provision of
federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax laws, in each
case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the
Holder of the securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority.
