AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this
"Agreement") is made January 3, 2005, by and among RAYOVAC CORPORATION, a
Wisconsin corporation ("Acquiror"), LINDBERGH CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("Newco") and UNITED
INDUSTRIES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). The foregoing
parties to this Agreement are each a "Party" and collectively the
"Parties."   BACKGROUND STATEMENT   The respective Boards of Directors of
the Parties have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and deemed it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective corporations and stockholders that the Parties
consummate the Merger and the other transactions provided for herein. As a
condition and inducement to Acquiror\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, at or immediately following the execution of this Agreement, UIC
Holdings, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company ("Holdings"), as the
owner of over eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding voting and non-voting
stock of the Company, will execute a written consent of the stockholders of
the Company (dated as of the date hereof) in the form of Exhibit A (the
"Consent") approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the Merger. For United States federal income tax purposes,
the Parties intend that the Merger qualify as a reorganization under the
provisions of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the Parties intend by executing this Agreement to adopt a
plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g).   STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.  THE MERGER  
Section 1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"), Newco shall be merged with
and into the Company (the "Merger"), the separate corporate existence of
Newco shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation."   Section
1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Certificate

practicable on or after the Closing Date. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place (a) at the offices of Sutherland Asbill and Brennan
LLP, 1114 Avenue of the Americas, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10036, 10:00
a.m., local time on February 4, 2005 or, if later, the third (3rd) Business
Day after the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied or waived by
the Party or Parties entitled to waive them, or (b) at such other place and
time as the Parties may agree (the "Closing Date").   Section 1.3 Effect of
the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.  
Section 1.4 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Newco as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation;
provided, however, that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation is
United Industries Corporation." At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the
Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to
the Bylaws of Newco as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in
such Bylaws.   Section 1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Newco immediately prior
to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of Newco immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
their respective successors are duly appointed.   Section 1.6 Tax
Consequences. It is intended by the Parties that the Merger shall constitute
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
Parties adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).   Section 1.7 Further Action. At
and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Acquiror and the
Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company and Newco, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments
or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company
and Newco, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record
or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.   ARTICLE II.  CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES  
Section 2.1 Merger Consideration. The total consideration to be paid by
Acquiror to all of the holders of Company Common Shares, Warrants and Options
(subject to adjustment for rounding pursuant to Section 2.5(a) and for the
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.5(b)) under this Agreement shall be a combination of 13,750,000 shares of
Acquiror Stock and $70,000,000.00 in cash (collectively, the "Merger
Consideration"). For purposes of making the allocations of the Merger
Consideration described in this Agreement, the shares of Acquiror Stock are
assigned a value of $29.40 per share (determined on the basis of the average
of the closing prices of Acquiror Stock for the ten (10) trading day period
leading up to and including December 31, 2004). Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, including the election and allocation provisions set forth in
this Article II, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any Person:   (a) Company
Options.   (i) In the Money Options. Each Option with an exercise price 
per Company Common Share less than $5.997 that remains unexercised, vested 
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "In the Money 
Options") shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash 
equal to the amount obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Exercisable 
Shares subject to such holder\'s In the Money Options by (y) the result 
obtained by subtracting the exercise price per share for such In the Money 
Options from $5.997.   (ii) Out of the Money Options. Each Option with an
exercise  price per Company Common Share equal to or greater than $5.997
shall not  be entitled to receive any Merger Consideration.   (iii)
Termination of all Options. Each Option that is  outstanding and unexercised
as of the Effective Time, whether or not then  vested and exercisable, shall
be terminated as of the Effective Time.   (b) Company Common Shares. Each
Company Common Share (excluding treasury stock (which for this purpose shall
not include any shares held by a trustee under any of the Company\'s or the
Subsidiaries\' deferred compensation plans) and Dissenting Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the election of
the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive:   (i) 0.20398
shares of Acquiror Stock (the "Stock Exchange  Ratio"); or   (ii) cash in
the amount of $5.997 (the "Cash Exchange Ratio").   (c) Warrants. Each
Warrant that remains unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the election of the holder thereof, either:   (i)
Exchanged Warrants. Be converted into the right to receive:   (A) the number
of shares of Acquiror Stock equal to the  result obtained by (1) multiplying
(Y) the number of  Company Common Shares for which such Warrants are 
exercisable by (Z) the result obtained by subtracting the  exercise price per
share for such Warrant from $5.997 and  then (2) dividing the result obtained
in (1) by $29.40;  and/or   (B) cash in the amount obtained by multiplying
(x) the  number of Company Common Shares for which such Warrant is 
exercisable by (y) the result obtained by subtracting the  exercise price per
share for such Warrant from $5.997; or   (ii) Retained Warrants. Continue to
remain outstanding in  accordance with its terms and after the Effective Time
be exercisable for  the following consideration contained in the Exchange
Fund, rather than  Company Common Shares, in a consideration mix determined
pursuant to  Section 2.6:   (A) the number of shares of Acquiror Stock
obtained by  multiplying the number of Company Common Shares for which  such
Warrant is exercisable by the Stock Exchange Ratio;   (B) cash in an amount
obtained by multiplying the number of  Company Common Shares for which such
Warrant is exercisable  by $5.997; or   (C) a combination of such Acquiror
Stock and cash  determined in accordance with clauses (A) and (B).  
Section 2.2 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Article II, the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:   (a) "Company
Common Shares" means the Company\'s $0.01 par value Class A Common Stock and
$0.01 par value, Class B Common Stock.   (b) "Exercisable Shares" means,
with respect to each In the Money Option that remains outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the number of Company Common Shares for which
such In the Money Option is exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (c) "In the Money Options Aggregate Option Spread"
means $12,916,532.24 less the aggregate amount obtained by multiplying the
number of Exercisable Shares with respect to each In the Money Options as of
the date of this Agreement exercised prior to the Effective Time by the
result obtained by subtracting the exercise price for each such In the Money
Options from $5.997.   (d) "Options" means the currently outstanding options
to purchase 7,925,000 Company Common Shares (each, an "Option").   (e)
"Total Cash Consideration" means $70,000,000.00.   (f) "Total Cash to be
Allocated" means the sum of the Total Cash Consideration plus the aggregate
proceeds delivered by the Company to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
5.23.   (g) "Total Stock Consideration" means 13,750,000 shares
of Acquiror\'s $0.01 par value Common Stock ("Acquiror Stock").   (h)
"Warrants" means the currently outstanding warrants to purchase 9,500,000
Company Common Shares (each, a "Warrant").   Section 2.3 Treatment of
Shares. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Person:   (a) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares which are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which
dissenters\' rights shall have been properly demanded in accordance with
Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive, or be exchangeable for, Merger Consideration or cash in lieu of
fractional shares but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Delaware Law; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall subsequently deliver a written withdrawal of his
demand for appraisal of such shares, or (ii) if any holder fails to establish
his entitlement to dissenters\' rights, such holder or holders shall forfeit
the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and each of
such shares shall thereupon be deemed to be Cash Election Shares and
converted into the right to receive the cash consideration, without any
interest thereon, in accordance with Sections 2.1(b)(ii) and 2.6.   (b)
Treasury Shares. Each Company Common Share held as treasury stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective
Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Common Shares held by
any trustee under any of the Company\'s or any of the Subsidiaries\' deferred
compensation plans shall be treated as outstanding for purposes of this
Agreement.   (c) Outstanding Newco Stock. Each share of the capital stock
of Newco issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be converted into one share of the capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.4 Rights as Stockholders;
Stock Transfers. At the Effective Time, the Company Common Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist
and holders of Company Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no
rights as, stockholders of the Company, other than to receive any dividend or
other distribution with respect to such Company Common Shares with a record
date occurring prior to the Effective Time, the consideration provided under
this Article II and the appraisal rights in the case of Dissenting Shares.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of any Company Common
Shares.   Section 2.5 Fractional Shares and Cash and Rounding.   (a)
Fractional Cents and Rounding. Following the making of all allocations of
cash and Acquiror Stock in accordance with Section 2.6, if the amount of cash
to be paid to any holder of Company Common Shares, Options or Warrants would
entitle such holder to receive a fraction of a cent in cash, any such dollar
amounts shall be rounded to two decimal points, with any dollar amount equal
to 0.0050 or higher being rounded up to the next highest whole cent. The
foregoing determination will be determined on the basis of such holder\'s
aggregate holdings of Company Common Shares, In the Money Options
and Warrants, and the consideration payable hereunder in respect thereto.  
(b) Fractional Shares and Rounding. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of Acquiror Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in
the Merger and no Acquiror dividend or other distribution or stock split
or combination will relate to any fractional share of Acquiror Stock, and
such fractional share of Acquiror Stock will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any rights of a security holder of Acquiror; instead, if, after
the allocation of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6,
any holder of Company Common Shares or Warrants would otherwise be entitled
to a fractional share of Acquiror Stock, Acquiror shall pay to such holder
of Company Common Shares or Warrants (after taking into account all
Old Certificates delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without
interest) determined by multiplying such fractional share of Acquiror Stock
to which the holder would be entitled by $29.40. The determination of whether
any holder of Company Common Shares or Warrants would be entitled to a
fractional share of Acquiror Stock will be determined on the basis of such
holder\'s aggregate holdings of Company Common Shares and Warrants, and the
consideration payable hereunder in respect thereto. Following the making of
all allocations of cash and Acquiror Stock in accordance with Section 2.6, if
the amount of Acquiror Stock to be paid to any holder of Company Common
Shares, Options or Warrants would entitle such holder to receive a fractional
share of Acquiror Stock, any such fractional share amount shall be rounded to
six decimal points, with any amount equal to 0.0000005 or higher being
rounded up to the next highest one-hundred thousandth (.000001) of a share.
Any such fractional share of Acquiror Stock with respect to which Acquiror
has instead paid cash in lieu of such fractional share in accordance with
this Section 2.5 (b) shall be removed from the Exchange Fund and returned to
Acquiror.   Section 2.6 Exchange Procedures; Deposit of Merger
Consideration.   (a) Exchange Fund. Within ten (10) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, Acquiror shall appoint a financial institution or
other appropriate entity selected by Acquiror to act as exchange agent for
the Merger (in such capacity, the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
such Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of certificates
representing Company Common Shares ("Old Certificates") and the holders of In
the Money Options and Warrants that remain outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, for exchange and payment in accordance with this Article
II, certificates representing the Total Stock Consideration ("New
Certificates") and the Total Cash Consideration (such cash and New
Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Time, and any
amounts delivered by the Company to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
5.23 being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be
paid pursuant to this Article II in exchange for outstanding Company Common
Shares, to the holders of In the Money Options that remain unexercised,
vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and to the
holders of Warrants that remain outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall have no liability for any actions
taken, or failures to act, with respect to this Agreement in the absence of
gross negligence or intentional misconduct on the part of the Exchange Agent.
The Exchange Fund represents the total consideration to be paid to all
holders of Company Common Shares, Options and Warrants pursuant to
this Agreement and neither the Company, Acquiror nor the Exchange Agent shall
be required to pay any additional amounts to such holders of Company
Common Shares, Options or Warrants pursuant to this Agreement (other than
any additional amounts required due to rounding pursuant to Section 2.5(a),
cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and any
amounts required to be paid to holders of Dissenting Shares in excess of the
amounts allocated pursuant to Section 2.6).   (b) No Interest. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, including any cash to be
paid in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Stock or in respect of
dividends or distributions, that any holder of Company Common Shares, any
holder of an Option that remains outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time or any holder of a Warrant that remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive pursuant
to this Article II.   (c) Election and Exchange Procedures. As soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, or Acquiror
shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail or make available to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates representing issued and outstanding
Company Common Shares and each holder of Options or Warrants (i) the
Information Statement, (ii) a notice and letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the
certificates theretofore representing Company Common Shares or Warrants shall
pass only upon proper delivery of such certificates or Warrants to the
Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the Merger and the procedure for
surrendering to the Exchange Agent such certificates or Warrants, if
applicable, in exchange for the consideration set forth in Sections 2.1(b)
and (c) hereof; (iii) an election form in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
B ("Election Form") and (iv) a holder representation form in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C ("Holder Representation Form") whereby each such
holder will represent and agree, among other things, as to such holder\'s
ownership of the Company Common Shares, In the Money Options or Warrants free
of Liens, will indicate, in the case of Company Common Shares or Warrants,
whether such holder is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule
501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act ("Regulation D"), and
will acknowledge, in the case of Company Common Shares or Warrants, the
restrictions imposed upon the transfer of any Acquiror Stock received by such
holder pursuant to this Article II, as described in Sections 2.8(a) and 5.11.
Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or in the case of nominee
record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) of Company Common Shares or Warrants (A) to elect the number
of such holder\'s Company Common Shares or Warrants (or portion thereof) with
respect to which such Holder wishes to receive Acquiror Stock (the "Stock
Election Shares"), (B) to elect the number of such holder\'s Company Common
Shares or Warrants (or portion thereof) with respect to which such Holder
wishes to receive cash (the "Cash Election Shares"), or (C) to indicate that
such holder makes no such elections with respect to such holder\'s Company
Common Shares or Warrants (or portion thereof) (the "No-Election Shares").
Nominee record holders who hold Company Common Shares or Warrants on behalf
of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how many of the shares or
Warrants (or portion thereof) held by them are Stock Election Shares, Cash
Election Shares and No-Election Shares. Any Company Common Shares or Warrants
with respect to which the holder thereof shall not, as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern
Time, on the tenth (10th) Business Day following but not including the date
of mailing of the Election Form or such other date as Acquiror and the
Company shall mutually agree upon (the "Election Deadline"), have made such
an election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly
completed Election Form shall be deemed to be No-Election Shares.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: (X) if Acquiror
does not reasonably believe, with respect to any holder of Company Common
Shares or Warrants that has not submitted an effective, properly completed
Election Form and Holder Representation Form, that such holder is
an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D, all Company
Common Shares, including Company Common Shares underlying Warrants
(determined on a net exercise basis), actually or beneficially owned by such
holder shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares ("Non-Determinable
Shares"); (Y) to the extent that, upon making the allocations made pursuant
to Section 2.6(d), the number of holders of Company Common Shares or Warrants
who (i) are to receive Acquiror Stock pursuant to such allocations and (ii)
either indicate on Holder Representation Forms that such holders are not
"accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D, or do not indicate
whether they are "accredited investors" and who Acquiror does not reasonably
believe are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D
(collectively, the "Non-Accredited Investors") would exceed thirty-five (35),
then any Company Common Shares, including Company Common Shares underlying
Warrants (determined on a net exercise basis), actually or beneficially owned
by any such Non-Accredited Investors (collectively, the "Non-Accredited
Shares") shall be deemed Cash Election Shares and (Z) any Dissenting Shares,
for purposes of making the allocations described in Section 2.6(d), shall be
deemed Cash Election Shares. In the absence of an effective, properly
completed Election Form and Holder Representation Form from any holder of
Company Common Shares or Warrants, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain information reasonably sufficient to permit Acquiror to
determine whether it reasonably believes that such holder is an "accredited
investor" within the meaning of Regulation D. Any election to receive
Acquiror Stock or cash shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form will be properly completed only if
accompanied by certificates representing all shares of Company Common Shares,
if applicable, covered thereby and Warrants, if applicable, covered thereby,
subject in each case to the provisions of Section 2.6(g), and a completed
Holder Representation Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by
the person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written
notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice is actually received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. The Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion, after consultation with the Company and Acquiror, to
determine when any election, modification or revocation is received and
whether any such election, modification or revocation has been properly made
and to interpret the provisions of this Article II. If this Agreement is
terminated and abandoned prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall
return promptly to each of the Company\'s stockholders the certificates
representing Company Common Shares and the Warrants it has received from such
stockholder and shall return promptly to the Company the funds received
pursuant to Section 5.23. Any Holder of Company Common Shares or Warrants who
returns a properly completed Election Form, Holder Representation Form, Old
Certificates with respect to such Company Common Shares, if applicable, and
Warrants, if applicable, prior to the Election Deadline as well as each
holder of In the Money Options will be paid the Merger Consideration with
respect to such Company Common Shares, In the Money Options or Warrants as
soon as practicable at or immediately after the Effective Time.   (d)
Allocation of Merger Consideration.   (i) If the number of Cash Election
Shares times the Cash  Exchange Ratio is less than the Total Cash to be
Allocated minus the In  the Money Option Aggregate Option Spread, then:  
(1) all Cash Election Shares shall be  converted into the right to receive
cash in  accordance with Sections 2.1(b)(ii) and 2.1(c)(i)(B);   (2) No-
Election Shares shall then be treated  as Cash Election Shares to the extent
necessary to  have the total number of Cash Election Shares times  the Cash
Exchange Ratio equal the Total Cash to be  Allocated minus the In the Money
Option Aggregate  Option Spread. If less than all of the No-Election  Shares
need to be treated as Cash Election Shares,  then the Exchange Agent shall
allocate on a pro rata  basis as described in Section 2.6(d)(iv) which  No-
Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election  Shares in such manner as
the Exchange Agent shall  determine, and all remaining No-Election Shares
shall  thereafter be treated as Stock Election Shares;   (3) if all of the
No-Election Shares are  treated as Cash Election Shares under the preceding 
subsection and the total number of Cash Election  Shares times the Cash
Exchange Ratio is less than the  Total Cash to be Allocated minus the In the
Money  Option Aggregate Option Spread, then the Exchange  Agent shall
convert on a pro rata basis as described  in Section 2.6(d)(iv) a sufficient
number of Stock  Election Shares into Cash Election Shares  ("Reallocated
Cash Shares") such that the sum of the  number of Cash Election Shares plus
the number of  Reallocated Cash Shares times the Cash Exchange Ratio  equals
the Total Cash to be Allocated minus the In  the Money Option Aggregate
Option Spread, and all  Reallocated Cash Shares will be converted into the 
right to receive cash in accordance with Sections  2.1(b)(ii) and
2.1(c)(i)(B); and   (4) all the Stock Election Shares that are  not
Reallocated Cash Shares shall be converted into  the right to receive
Acquiror Stock in accordance  with Sections 2.1(b)(i) and 2.1(c)(i)(A).  
(ii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash  Exchange Ratio is
greater than the Total Cash to be Allocated minus the In  the Money Option
Aggregate Option Spread, then:   (1) all Stock Election Shares and all  No-
Election Shares shall be converted into the right  to receive Acquiror Stock
(upon exercise in the case  of unexchanged Warrants) in accordance with
Sections  2.1(b)(i), 2.1(c)(i)(A) and 2.1(c)(ii)(A);   (2) the Exchange
Agent shall convert on a  pro rata basis as described in Section 2.6(d)(iv)
a  sufficient number of Cash Election Shares  ("Reallocated Stock Shares")
such that the number of  remaining Cash Election Shares times the Cash 
Exchange Ratio equals the Total Cash to be Allocated  minus the In the Money
Option Aggregate Option  Spread, and all Reallocated Stock Shares shall be 
converted into the right to receive Acquiror Stock in  accordance with
Sections 2.1(b)(i) and 2.1(c)(i)(A);  and   (3) all the Cash Election
Shares that are  not Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into  the
right to receive cash in accordance with Sections  2.1(b)(ii) and
2.1(c)(i)(B).   (iii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash 
Exchange Ratio is equal to the Total Cash to be Allocated minus the In the 
Money Option Aggregate Option Spread, then subparagraphs (d)(i) and (ii) 
above shall not apply and all No-Election Shares and all Stock Election 
Shares will be converted into the right to receive Acquiror Stock.   (iv) In
the event that the Exchange Agent is required pursuant  to Section
2.6(d)(i)(2) to allocate which No-Election Shares are to be  treated as Cash
Election Shares and which No-Election Shares are to be  treated as Stock
Election Shares, each holder of No-Election Shares shall  be allocated a pro
rata portion of the total No-Election Shares that need  to be treated as Cash
Election Shares based on the total number of Company  Common Shares,
including Company Common Shares underlying Warrants  (determined on a net
exercise basis), designated as No-Election Shares and  the number of Cash
Election Shares required to be allocated pursuant to  Section 2.6(d)(i)(2).
In the event that the Exchange Agent is required  pursuant to Section
2.6(d)(i)(3) to convert some Stock Election Shares  into Reallocated Cash
Shares, each holder of Stock Election Shares shall  be allocated a pro rata
portion of the total Reallocated Cash Shares based  on the total number of
Company Common Shares, including Company Common  Shares underlying Warrants
(determined on a net exercise basis), held by  such holder of Stock Election
Shares and the total number of Company  Common Shares, including Company
Common Shares underlying Warrants  (determined on a net exercise basis), held
by all such holders of Stock  Election Shares. In the event the Exchange
Agent is required pursuant to  Section 2.6(d)(ii)(2) to convert some Cash
Election Shares into  Reallocated Stock Shares, each holder of Cash Election
Shares shall be  allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Stock
Shares based  on the total number of Company Common Shares, including Company
Common  Shares underlying Warrants (determined on a net exercise basis), held
by  such holder of Cash Election Shares and the total number of Company
Common  Shares, including Company Common Shares underlying Warrants
(determined on  a net exercise basis), held by all such holders of Cash
Election Shares;  provided, however, that in no event shall any Non-
Determinable Shares, any  Non-Accredited Shares, if Section 2.6(c)(Y)
applies, or any Dissenting  Shares be included in such calculations or
converted into Reallocated  Stock Shares.   (e) Unclaimed Merger
Consideration. Promptly following the date that is six (6) months after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation
all cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement; and any holders of Company Common
Shares, Options or Warrants who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II may look thereafter only to the Surviving Corporation for the
Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to this Article II,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Any such portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Common Shares, Options or
Warrants immediately prior to the time that such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party
hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Shares, Options
or Warrants for any Acquiror Stock, any dividends or distributions thereon or
any cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration or in lieu of
fractional shares of Acquiror Stock, in each case, which has been delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.   (f) No Dividends with Respect to Unsurrendered Old
Certificates. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquiror
Stock with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing Company
Common Shares converted in the Merger into the right to receive such Acquiror
Stock until the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive New Certificates
in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 2.6. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section 2.6,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to the shares of Acquiror Stock such holder had
the right to receive upon surrender of the Old Certificates.   (g) Lost
Certificates or Warrants. If any Old Certificate or Warrant has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Old Certificate or Warrant to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Acquiror, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as Acquiror may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate
or Warrant, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Old Certificate or Warrant (i) the number of shares of
Acquiror Stock to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Sections
2.1(b)(i), 2.1(c)(i) or 2.1(d), and (ii) a check in an amount equal to the
sum of the cash to be paid to such Person as part of the Merger
Consideration, if any, and the cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
shares of Acquiror Stock to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section
2.5, if any.   (h) Withholding. Acquiror and the Exchange Agent,
after consultation with the Company, are entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Company Common Shares, Warrants or In the Money Options such amounts
as Acquiror is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts may be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Company
Common Shares, Warrants or In the Money Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent.  
(i) Affiliates. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article II, Old
Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Person who may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c) under the
Securities Act, including all of the directors and executive officers of the
Company (each, a "Rule 145 Affiliate"), shall not be exchanged until Acquiror
has received a written agreement from that Rule 145 Affiliate in the form
attached as Exhibit D (a "Rule 145 Affiliate Agreement").   Section 2.7
Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Acquiror changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of shares of Acquiror Stock issued and
outstanding between the date hereof and the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, split up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding shares of Acquiror Stock and the record
date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Stock Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately adjusted.   Section 2.8 Legending of
Securities.   (a) The shares of Acquiror Stock to be delivered in connection
with this Agreement will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") by reason
of Section 4(2) thereof, Regulation D, or other private offering exemptions,
and similar exemptions under applicable state securities laws (the "State
Acts"), and Acquiror is relying on the representations of the stockholders of
the Company with respect to such exemptions. Each stockholder will
acknowledge in its Holder Representation Form that it understands and agrees,
that stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares of Acquiror Stock
received by such stockholder pursuant to this Agreement will be given to
Acquiror\'s transfer agent and that there will be placed on the certificates
for such shares legends stating in substance as follows:   (i) The
securities represented hereby have not been  registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or any  state or other securities laws and may not
be offered, sold,  transferred or otherwise disposed of unless registered
with the  United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
securities regulatory authorities of applicable states or foreign  countries
or unless an exemption from such registration is  available.   (ii) The
offer, sale, transfer or disposal of the securities  represented hereby is
restricted pursuant to a Holder  Representation Form and Section 5.11 of the
Agreement and Plan of  Merger among Rayovac Corporation, United Industries
Corporation,  and the other parties thereto. Rayovac Corporation shall
furnish  to the Holder hereof a copy of such Form and Agreement and Plan of 
Merger upon request and without charge.   (b) The foregoing legends will
also be placed on any certificate representing securities issued subsequent
to the original issuance of the Acquiror Stock pursuant to this Agreement as
a result of any transfer of such shares or any stock dividend, stock split or
other recapitalization as long as the Acquiror Stock issued to the holders of
Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement has not been transferred in
such manner to justify the removal of the legends therefrom.   (c) (i) Upon
request from any holder of Acquiror Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement
received more than twelve (12) months but less than eighteen (18) months
after the Closing Date, Acquiror will cause the transfer agent for its stock
to issue new certificates to such requesting holder reflecting the legend set
forth in (a)(ii) above only on fifty percent (50%) of such shares of Acquiror
Stock, (ii) upon request from any holder of Acquiror Stock issued pursuant to
this Agreement received more than eighteen (18) months after the Closing
Date, Acquiror will cause the transfer agent for its stock to issue new
certificates to such requesting holder reflecting the removal of the legend
set forth in (a)(ii) above on all such shares of Acquiror Stock and (iii) the
legend set forth in (a)(i) above shall be removed by Acquiror from any
certificate evidencing Acquiror Stock upon delivery to Acquiror of an opinion
by counsel, reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, that a
registration statement under the Securities Act is at that time in effect
with respect to the legended security or that such security can be freely
transferred in a public sale without such a registration statement being in
effect and that such transfer will not jeopardize the exemption or exemptions
from registration pursuant to which the Acquiror Stock was issued
hereunder.   ARTICLE III.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO
THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Acquiror and Newco as

timely filed all income Tax and other material Tax returns, declarations,
reports, information returns and statements ("Returns") required to be filed
by it in respect of any United States federal, state or local, or foreign
Taxes and has duly and timely paid all income Taxes and other material Taxes
due and payable by it, other than Taxes which are being contested in good
faith (and disclosed by the Company to Acquiror in writing). As used herein,
"Tax" or "Taxes" means and includes any and all taxes, fees, levies,
assessments, duties, tariffs, imposts, and other charges of any kind
(together with any and all interest, penalties, additions to tax and
additional amounts imposed with respect thereto) imposed by any Governmental
Entity, including, without limitation: foreign, domestic, central, local,
state or other jurisdictional taxes or other charges on or with respect to
income, estimated income, franchises, business, occupation, windfall or other
profits, gross receipts, property, sales, use, capital stock, payroll,
employment, social security, workers\' compensation, unemployment
compensation, or net worth; taxes or other charges in the nature of excise,
withholding, ad valorem, stamp, transfer, value added, or gains taxes;
license, registration and documentation fees; and customs duties, tariffs,
and similar charges. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and the Subsidiaries for the period ending September 30, 2004, establishes
reserves for the payment of all income Taxes and other material Taxes not yet
due and payable as of such date in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis, except as otherwise stated in the Company
Financial Statements. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries have complied
in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment
and withholding of Taxes from employees and other Persons.   (b) None of
the income Tax and other material Tax Returns of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries have been examined by the IRS or any other United States
federal, state or local or any foreign Governmental Entity within the past
six (6) years, other than reviews and assessments undertaken by the Canada
Revenue Agency in the ordinary course for all Canadian Returns. There are no
audits or other Governmental Entity proceedings presently pending nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any other disputes pending with respect to,
or claims asserted for, Taxes upon the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
nor has the Company or any of the Subsidiaries given any currently
outstanding waivers or comparable consents regarding the application of any
statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes or Returns. There are no
Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries,
except Liens for Taxes not yet due.   (c) Neither the Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries (i) has requested any extension of time within which to file
any Return which has not since been filed or (ii) is required to include in
income any adjustment by reason of a voluntary change in accounting method
initiated by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (nor to the Knowledge of
the Company, has any Governmental Entity proposed any such adjustment or
change of accounting method).   (d) There is no contract, agreement, plan
or arrangement covering any person that, individually or collectively, could
give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by
Acquiror and its affiliated group (including the Surviving Corporation) by
reason of Section 280G of the Code or give rise to any Tax under Section 4999
of the Code.   (e) None of the Company or the Subsidiaries has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the
two (2) years prior to the date hereof or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (f) Neither the Company nor
any of the Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group (other than a group of which Holdings, the Company
or a Subsidiary is the common parent), or has any liability for Taxes of any
Person (other than Holdings, the Company and the Subsidiaries) under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar provision of Law.  
(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to any tax
sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar agreement or arrangement (whether
or not written) pursuant to which it will have any obligation to make any
payments after the Closing.   (h) No circumstances exist or have existed
which have resulted in or may result in the application of any of sections 79
to 80.04 (relating generally to debt forgiveness) of the Income Tax Act
(Canada), as amended (the "Canadian Tax Act") (or similar laws of a province)
to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries. No Subsidiary has received a
requirement pursuant to section 224 of the Canadian Tax Act which remains
unsatisfied in any respect. For taxation years commencing after 1998 and
ending on or before the Closing Date each Subsidiary has made and obtained
records or documents, where required, that meet the requirements of
paragraphs 247(4)(a) to (c) of the Canadian Tax Act with respect to all
transactions and arrangements with non-resident Persons not dealing at arm\'s
length with the relevant company within the meaning of the Canadian Tax Act.
No Subsidiary has claimed any reserve for tax purposes, if as a result of
such claim any amount could be included in income for a taxation year ending
after the Closing Date and no Subsidiary has made a payment, nor is or may be
obligated to make any payment, that may not be deductible by virtue of
section 67 or 78 of the Canadian Tax Act (or similar laws of a
province). There are no circumstances which have or could result in the
application, either before, on or after Closing Date, of section 17 or
paragraph 214(3)(a) of the Canadian Tax Act to any Subsidiary.   Section

Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real Property") and (ii) all of the leases (the
"Leases") for real property to which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
is a party. Each Lease is in full force and effect, except to the extent that
its enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws and court decisions relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally (including statutory or other
Laws regarding fraudulent transfers), and is subject to general principles of
equity.   (b) The Company or one of the Subsidiaries has good and
marketable title to or valid leasehold interests, in all properties and
assets that are material to the conduct of the business of the Company,
including those reflected in the Company Financial Statements (or acquired
after the date of the Company Financial Statements by the Company or the
Subsidiaries), or not reflected on the Company Financial Statements but used
by the Company or the Subsidiaries, except for assets and properties sold,
consumed or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business since
September 30, 2004 (which, to the extent material, are disclosed in Section

(collectively, the "Properties"), free and clear of any title defects or
Liens, except (i) Liens securing debt reflected as liabilities on the latest
balance sheet included in the Company Financial Statements, (ii) Liens for
current Taxes and assessments not in default, (iii) mechanics\', carriers\',
workers\', repair persons\', statutory or common law Liens either not
delinquent or being contested in good faith and (iv) Liens, covenants,
rights-of-way, building or use restrictions, easements, exceptions,
variances, reservations and other matters or limitations of any kind, if any,
which could not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on
the Company\'s or the Subsidiaries\' use of such Properties affected for the
purposes currently used or materially diminish the value of such
Properties.   (c) No Person other than the Company or the Subsidiaries
is currently entitled to possession of any of the Properties, whether owned
or leased by the Company or the Subsidiaries. The buildings, structures
and improvements owned or leased by the Company or the Subsidiaries conform
in all material respects to all applicable Laws, including zoning
regulations, none of which would upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby materially adversely interfere with the use of such
Properties, buildings, structures or improvements for the purposes for which
they are now utilized. Except as set forth in Section 3.16(c) of the
Disclosure Letter, (i) each of the Properties is adequate in all material
respects for the operations for which it is being used by the Company or the
Subsidiaries, (ii) each of the Properties is in reasonably good repair and
operating condition, normal wear and tear excepted, and (iii) the Properties
constitute all of the properties that the Company and the Subsidiaries use in
connection with the operation of their business as currently conducted. The
Company and the Subsidiaries do not have any commitment or plan to make any
capital expenditure with respect to any of the Properties in excess of
$100,000 that has not been set forth in Section 3.16(c) of the Disclosure
Letter.   Section 3.17 Contracts. Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Letter
sets forth an accurate and complete list of each written and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, each oral agreement, contract, obligation, promise,

Property Right; (g) involves the grant by or to the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of exclusive rights; or (h) is otherwise material to the assets,
business, operations or financial condition of the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, the "Company Contracts"). To the
Knowledge of the Company, all of the Company Contracts and Leases are
enforceable by the Company or the Subsidiary which is a party thereto in
accordance with their terms except to the extent that such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
Laws and court decisions relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally, and is subject to general principles of equity.

set forth in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor
any of the Subsidiaries is in material breach or default under (and no event
has occurred which with notice or the passage of time or both would
constitute a material breach or default under) any Company Contract or Lease
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is any other party to any of the
Company Contracts or Leases in default thereunder (and to the Knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred which with notice or the passage of time
or both would constitute a material breach or default thereunder). The
Company has provided or made available to Acquiror true and complete copies
of all of the Company Contracts and Leases.   Section 3.18 Inventory. Except

Except as set forth in the Company Financial Statements or Section 3.18 of
the Disclosure Letter, no material amount of inventory previously sold by the
Company or a Subsidiary is subject to returns or recalls.   Section 3.19
Accounts Receivable. The Company\'s and the Subsidiaries\' accounts
receivable: (a) are valid and existing and collectable in the ordinary course
of business (subject to the bad debt reserves shown in the Company Financial
Statements); (b) represent monies due for goods sold and delivered
or services rendered in the ordinary course of business; and (c) are subject
to no refunds or other adjustments (except discounts for prompt payment given

aggregate expenses incurred by the Company and the Subsidiaries in fulfilling

(e) The Company and the Subsidiaries have insurance against loss or damage
arising out of product liability, true and complete copies of which have been

Filing when it became effective or was filed with the SEC, as the case may
be, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and each
Company SEC Filing did not on the date of effectiveness or filing, as the
case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has
filed, in a timely manner, all forms, reports and documents required to be
made under the Exchange Act for the twelve (12) months prior to the date of
this Agreement. The financial statements of the Company included in the

account of one or more of the Subsidiaries or their customers, were entered
into (i) in accordance with prudent business practices and all applicable
Laws, and (ii) with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at
the time; and each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of the Company or the Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with
its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency or other laws and court decisions relating to or
affecting this enforcement of creditors\' rights generally (including
statutory or other laws regarding fraudulent transfers) and (ii)
the availability of specific performance or other equitable remedies, and are
in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries,
nor to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, is in breach of
any of its material obligations under any such agreement or arrangement. The
Company SEC Filings disclose the value of such agreements and arrangements on
a mark-to-market basis in accordance with GAAP, as modified to give effect
to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, and, since September
30, 2004, there has not been a material change in such value.   Section
3.31 Accounting Controls. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries has
devised and maintained systems of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of
the Company, that: (i) all material transactions are executed in accordance

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP consistently applied or any other criteria

policies, manuals and other documents promulgating, such disclosure controls
and procedures to the extent such materials are of general applicability
with respect to the disclosure controls and procedures of the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries.   Section 3.32 Board Recommendation. The Board of
Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held, has by the vote
of those directors present (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, the execution and
delivery of the Company Delivered Agreements and other agreements and
arrangements, including those related to restrictions on the transfer of the
Acquiror Stock received as Merger Consideration, and the transactions
contemplated thereby, taken together, are advisable and fair to and in the

acknowledges that, other than as set forth in this Agreement, Acquiror or

ACQUIROR   Acquiror and Newco, jointly and severally, represent and warrant
to the Company as follows, except as set forth in the letter delivered by
Acquiror to the Company on the date hereof, which contains certain exceptions
to the representations and warranties of Acquiror and Newco in this Agreement
(the "Purchaser Disclosure Letter"):   Section 4.1 Organization and
Qualification. Acquiror is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Wisconsin and has the
corporate power and authority to own all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Newco is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to own all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each of Acquiror and Newco is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in all jurisdictions in which it is required to be qualified
and in which the failure to be so qualified would not have an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect. "Acquiror Material Adverse Effect" means a material
adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of
operations or financial condition of Acquiror and Newco, taken as a whole,
but excluding any effect resulting from or relating to (a) general economic
conditions or general effects on the industry in which Acquiror and Newco are
primarily engaged (including as a result of (i) an outbreak or escalation of
hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United
States of a national emergency or war or (ii) the occurrence of any other
calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic
conditions in the United States), (b) resulting from the public announcement
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (c) relating to or
resulting from action taken by the Company or any of its Affiliates or
representatives.   Section 4.2 Authority. Each of Acquiror and Newco has the
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and any
other agreements, instruments and documents executed and delivered by
Acquiror and Newco pursuant to this Agreement (this Agreement and such other
agreements, instruments and documents are collectively referred to as the
"Purchaser Delivered Agreements") and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and otherwise to comply with and perform its obligations
under, them. The execution and delivery by Acquiror and Newco of the
Purchaser Delivered Agreements and the consummation by Acquiror and Newco of
the transactions contemplated on its part thereby have been duly authorized
by each of their Boards of Directors. No other corporate action on the part
of Acquiror and Newco is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of
the Purchaser Delivered Agreements by Acquiror and Newco or the consummation
by Acquiror and Newco, of the transactions contemplated thereby. The
Purchaser Delivered Agreements will, when executed and delivered by Acquiror
and Newco, constitute valid and binding obligations of Acquiror and Newco
enforceable against Acquiror and Newco, in accordance with their terms,
except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws and court decisions
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally
(including statutory or other Laws regarding fraudulent transfers), and is
subject to general principles of equity.   Section 4.3 No Consents Required.
Except as disclosed in Section 4.3 of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter and
except (i) for the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and any filings required under the
Canadian Competition Act, if any; (ii) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger; and (iii) where failure to obtain such Authorization would not
prevent Acquiror and Newco from performing their obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect, no Authorization of or with any
Governmental Entity is required in connection with the execution and delivery
of the Purchaser Delivered Agreements by Acquiror or the consummation by
Acquiror and Newco of the transactions contemplated by, or other compliance
with or performance under, the Purchaser Delivered Agreements.   Section 4.4
Absence of Violations or Conflicts. Except as disclosed in Section 4.4 of the
Purchaser Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of the Purchaser
Delivered Agreements by Acquiror and Newco do not and the consummation by
either Acquiror and Newco of the transactions contemplated by, or other
compliance with or performance under, them do not and will not with the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both (a) constitute a
violation of, be in conflict with any provision of the articles or
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of either Acquiror or Newco, (b)
violate or conflict with, or result (with the giving of notice or the lapse
of time or both) in a violation of or constitute a default under, any
material Governmental Order to which either Acquiror or Newco is a party or
by which either Acquiror or Newco or either of their assets or properties is
bound or any applicable Laws or (c) constitute a breach or violation of or a
default under any material agreement or contract to which Acquiror is a
party, by which it is bound or to which any of its assets are subject,
except, in the case of (b) and (c), where such violation, conflict, default,
termination or imposition could not reasonably be expected to have an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.5 Absence of Certain Changes
or Events. Except as set forth in Section 4.5 of the Purchaser Disclosure
Letter, since September 30, 2004 there has not been any change, development,
event or condition that has resulted in, or could be reasonably expected to
result in, an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect and Acquiror has not incurred
any debts, liabilities or obligations of any kind whatsoever, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent, changing, known, unknown, determinable,
indeterminable, liquidated, unliquidated or otherwise and whether due or to
become due in the future which would be required by GAAP to be disclosed in
Acquiror\'s consolidated balance sheet.   Section 4.6 SEC Reports. Acquiror
has furnished the Company with copies of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
the quarters ended December 28, 2003, March 28, 2004 and June 27, 2004 and
all other reports or registration statements filed by Acquiror with the SEC
under applicable Laws since September 30, 2003 (all such reports and
registration statements being herein collectively called the "Acquiror SEC
Filings"), each as filed with the SEC. Except the fact that Part III, Item 12
of the Form 10-K was incomplete and needed to be amended, each such Acquiror
SEC Filing when it became effective or was filed with the SEC, as the case
may be, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder and each Acquiror SEC Filing did not on the
date of effectiveness or filing, as the case may be, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Acquiror has made all filings required to be made
under the Exchange Act for the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this
Agreement. The financial statements of Acquiror included in the Acquiror SEC
Filings complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (expect
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X of the SEC) and
fairly present in all material respects in accordance with applicable
requirements of GAAP (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal, recurring adjustments, none of which will be material) the
consolidated financial position of Acquiror and its consolidated subsidiaries
as of their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations and
the consolidated cash flows of Acquiror and its consolidated subsidiaries for
the periods presented therein. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer of Acquiror have signed, and Acquiror has filed with the
SEC, all certifications required by Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and such certifications contain no qualifications or exceptions to the
matters certified therein and have not been modified or withdrawn,
and neither Acquiror nor any of its officers has received notice from
any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy,
completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications. As used in
this Section 4.5, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any
manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied otherwise
made available to the SEC.   Section 4.7 Rayovac Shares. Immediately prior
to execution of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Acquiror is
150,000,000 shares of Acquiror Stock and 5,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value
preferred stock (collectively, the "Rayovac Shares"), of which 34,438,122
shares of the Rayovac Shares and no shares or preferred stock are issued and
outstanding and 29,575,071 shares of the Rayovac Shares are held as treasury
stock. All of the issued and outstanding Rayovac Shares are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive rights. The shares of Acquiror Stock to be
delivered in connection with the Merger will be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. A sufficient number of shares have been
reserved by Acquiror\'s Board of Directors to provide for such issuance.  
Section 4.8 Financing. Acquiror has received executed commitments from one or
more financial institutions to provide, subject to the conditions specified
therein, funds sufficient in amount to consummate the Merger and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the refinancing of the
existing indebtedness of the Company, copies of which are attached as Section
4.8 of the Purchaser Disclosure Letter (the "Commitment Letters"). Acquiror
has paid all commitment fees required to be paid and taken all other actions
required to cause such Commitment Letters to be effective and to constitute
the valid commitment of the issuer(s) of such Commitment Letters. There is no
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant under the Commitment
Letters and the Commitment Letters are valid and binding commitments of
Acquiror and, to Acquiror\'s Knowledge, of the issuer(s) thereof to the
extent set forth on the face thereof. There is no fact, occurrence or
condition that makes any of the assumptions or statements therein inaccurate
in any material respect or that would cause the commitments provided in the
Commitment Letters to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions
contained therein not to be met.   Section 4.9 Investment. Acquiror is
acquiring the Company Common Shares received by it as a result of the Merger
for its own account, for investment only, and not with a view to any resale
or public distribution thereof. Acquiror shall not offer to sell or otherwise
dispose of such Company Common Shares (or the Surviving Corporation) in
violation of any Law applicable to any such offer, sale or other disposition.
Acquiror acknowledges that the Company Common Shares have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and cannot be resold
unless they are so registered or unless an exception from registration is
available, and it must bear the economic risk of its investment in the
Securities for an indefinite period of time. Acquiror is an "accredited
investor" within the meaning of Regulation D.   Section 4.10 Litigation.
There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Acquiror, threatened against or affecting Acquiror at law or in equity, or
before or by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental department,
commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, domestic or foreign,
which would adversely affect Acquiror\'s performance of its obligations under
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise could be reasonably expected to have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 4.11 Qualification as a Reorganization. Acquiror knows of
no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.   Section 4.12 Brokers, Finders and Investment Bankers.
Except for Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Merrill, Lynch and Co., Inc.,
neither Acquiror, Newco nor any of their officers, directors or employees has

finders\' or similar fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   Section 4.13 No Other Representations or Warranties;
Disclosure Letter. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
this Article IV (as modified by the Purchaser Disclosure Letter), none of
Acquiror, Newco nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Acquiror, Newco or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Acquiror and Newco disclaim
any other representations or warranties, whether made by Acquiror and Newco
or any of their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV hereof (as modified by the Purchaser Disclosure Letter), Acquiror
and Newco hereby disclaim all liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or information
made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to the Company or its
Affiliates or representatives (including any opinion, information,
projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to the Company by
any director, officer, employee, agent, consultant, or representative of the
Company or any of its Affiliates). The disclosure of any matter or item in
the Purchaser Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment that any such matter is required to be disclosed.   Section
4.14 Acknowledgement of Acquiror. Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that it
has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business,
assets, condition and operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries. In
entering into this Agreement, Acquiror has relied solely upon its

covenants and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement and
Acquiror (a) acknowledges that, other than as set forth in this Agreement,
none of the Company, nor any of its respective directors, officers,

representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any of the information provided or made available to Acquiror
or its agents or representatives prior to the execution of this Agreement,
(b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law (except with respect to
claims of fraud), that none of the Company, nor any of its respective

provided or made available, or statements made, to Acquiror prior to the
execution of this Agreement and (c) acknowledges that it is not aware of any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Article III of this
Agreement being untrue or inaccurate. Notwithstanding anything herein, the
review and analyses conducted by Acquiror shall in no way vitiate or
otherwise modify the representations and warranties made by the Company in
Article III of this Agreement.   ARTICLE V.  ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND
AGREEMENTS   Section 5.1 Information Statement.   (a) Preparation and
Distribution. The Company and Acquiror will prepare an information statement,

with Regulation D promulgated under the Exchange Act and Delaware Law, and
the Company shall provide the Information Statement to its stockholders and
holders of Warrants as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 2.6(c). The Company and Acquiror will furnish all
information concerning the Company and Acquiror, respectively, as may be
reasonably necessary or requested in connection with the foregoing. None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company or Acquiror for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will, at
the time the Information Statement is first published, sent or given to
holders of Company Common Shares, and at any time it is amended or
supplemented, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. If any of the Parties becomes aware prior to
the Effective Time of any information furnished by it that would cause any of
the statements in the Information Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, it will promptly
inform the other Parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct
the Information Statement.   (b) Non-Accredited Stockholders. The Company
shall assist Acquiror in obtaining such information as Acquiror reasonably
requires to allow Acquiror to determine the number and nature of the Company
stockholders and holders of Warrants in their capacity as purchasers (as such
term is used under Rule 506 of Regulation D). In connection with the
distribution of the Information Statement to the Company stockholders, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Company
stockholder to complete and return an accredited investor questionnaire in
accordance with Section 2.6(c). The Company shall cause all Non-Accredited
Investors to use a "purchaser representative" (as defined in Rule 501(h) of
Regulation D) to assist the Non-Accredited Investors in evaluating the
Information Statement and the investment decisions represented by this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section

current Liabilities  incurred in the ordinary and usual course of business,
or fail to  pay any Liability when due or take or fail to take any action,
the  taking of which, or the failure to take of which, would permit any

become  responsible for the obligations of any other Person other than 
endorsements of negotiable instruments in the ordinary course of  business,
or make any loans or advances to any Person;   (iii) declare, set aside or

normal prior practice;   (ix) permit any insurance policy naming it as a

full force and effect;   (x) amend its Bylaws or other governing
documents;   (xi) enter into any union, collective bargaining or similar

at reasonable hours, and shall furnish Acquiror with such financial and
operating data and other information with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries as Acquiror may from time to time reasonably request. Any
disclosure whatsoever during such investigation by Acquiror shall not
constitute any endorsement or additional representations or warranties of the
Company or any Subsidiary beyond those specifically set forth in this
Agreement.   Section 5.3 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances;
Cooperation. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties hereto shall in good faith perform their obligations under this

obligation under this Agreement;   (c) By the Company, if any event shall
have occurred as a result of which any condition set forth in Section 6.1 or
6.3 is no longer capable of being satisfied; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall not
be available to the Company if the condition to its obligation to perform
became incapable of fulfillment due to its failure, or the failure of any of
its Affiliates, to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement; or   (d) By
Acquiror or the Company, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
March 31, 2005, provided, however that a Party whose breach of this Agreement
has resulted in the Closing not having occurred on or before said date shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d).   Section 8.2 Specific Performance; Remedies Cumulative. The
Parties acknowledge that the rights of each Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby are special, unique, and of extraordinary
character, and that, in the event that any Party violates or fails and
refuses to perform any covenant made by it herein, the other Party or Parties
will be without adequate remedy at Law. In the event that any party violates,
fails or refuses to perform any covenant made by it herein, the other Party
or Parties may, in addition to any remedies at Law, institute and prosecute
an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific
performance of such covenant or seek any other equitable relief. No exercise
of a remedy available to a Party shall be deemed an election excluding any
other remedy available to such Party (any such claim by any other Party being
hereby waived).   Section 8.3 Rights and Obligations upon Termination. If
this Agreement is not consummated for any reason, each Party will redeliver
all documents, work papers, and other materials of any Party relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after
the execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the same, except to the
extent previously delivered to third parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and all information received by any Party
hereto with respect to the business of any other Party shall not at any time
be used for the advantage of, or disclosed to third parties by, such Party to
the detriment of the Party furnishing such information; provided, however,

or information which is a matter of public knowledge or which heretofore has
been or hereafter is published in any publication for public distribution or
filed as public information with any Governmental Entity.   Section 8.4

8.3 and 8.4 and Article IX, which shall survive any termination of this
Agreement, in the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement
pursuant to Article IX, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no further effect, without any liability on the part of any Party hereto or
its respective officers, directors or stockholders; provided, however, that

termination.   ARTICLE IX.  GENERAL PROVISIONS   Section 9.1 Non-Survival

Agreement or of such other documents.   Section 9.11 Governing Law; Consent
to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York (except as
it relates to corporate law involving Acquiror, in which case it shall be
governed by the Laws of the State of Wisconsin, and except as it relates to
the procedures for the Merger, in which case it shall be governed by Delaware

defined below).   BACKGROUND STATEMENT   Pursuant to that certain

by and among the Company, Lindbergh Corporation and United, the Shareholders
may receive shares (the "Shares") of the Company\'s $0.01 par value common
stock (the "Common Stock"). The Company has agreed to provide certain
registration rights with respect to the Shares in accordance with this
Agreement.   STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   1. Certain Definitions. As
used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
respective meanings:   "Commission" shall mean the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or any other federal agency at the time administering the
Securities Act.   "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or any similar federal statute, and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder, all as the same shall be in effect
at the time.   "Registration Expenses" shall mean the expenses so described
in Section 6.   "Registration Statement" shall mean the Shelf Registration
Statement or Demand Registration Statement (each defined in Section 2) and
any additional registration statements contemplated by Sections 2 or 3,
including (in each case) the prospectus, amendments and supplements to such
registration statement or prospectus, all exhibits attached thereto, and all
material incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference
in such registration statement.   "Restricted Stock" shall mean the Shares,
excluding Shares which have been (a) registered under the Securities Act
pursuant to an effective Registration Statement filed thereunder and disposed
of in accordance with the Registration Statement covering them or (b)
publicly sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.   "Securities

will, (i) within nine (9) months following the Effective Time, prepare and
file with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-1 or, if
applicable, Form S-3, or any equivalent form for registration by issuers in
accordance with the Securities Act, to permit the resale from time to time of
the Restricted Stock under the Securities Act on a delayed or continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415 (the "Shelf Registration Statement"), (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be
declared effective (the "Registration Effective Date") within twelve (12)
months following the Effective Time and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective until the earlier
of (x) the two (2) year anniversary of the Registration Effective Date and
(y) the date on which all of the Restricted Stock covered by the
Shelf Registration Statement has been sold to the public pursuant to
such registration statement in accordance with the intended methods of
distribution thereof (the "Shelf Expiration Date"). The plan of distribution
contemplated by the Shelf Registration Statement shall permit resales of
Restricted Stock in the manner or manners designated by the Shareholders,
including offers and sales through underwriters or agents, offers and sales
directly to investors, block trades and such other methods of offer and sale
as the Shareholders shall request. The Company shall not permit any
securities other than Restricted Stock to be included in the Shelf
Registration Statement.   (b) Subject to Section 2(d), if, following the
Registration Effective Date, one or more Shareholders desires to sell
Restricted Stock in an underwritten offering pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement, such Shareholder or Shareholders may request in
writing that the Company file an amendment to the Shelf Registration
Statement, stating the number of shares of Restricted Stock proposed to be
sold and describing the plan of distribution, and the Company shall file such
an amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement as soon as reasonably
practicable and use reasonable best efforts to cause such amended Shelf
Registration Statement to become effective.   (c) Subject to Section 2(d),
if at any time after the Shelf Expiration Date, one or more Shareholders
desires to sell Restricted Stock in an underwritten public offering, such
Shareholder or Shareholders may request in writing that the Company (i)
prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-1 or,
if applicable, Form S-3, or any equivalent form for registration by issuers
in accordance with the Securities Act, to register the sale of Restricted
Stock under the Securities Act (the "Demand Registration Statement"), (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Demand Registration Statement to
be declared effective ("Demand Effective Date") and (iii) use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Demand Registration Statement to remain effective
until the earlier of (x) one hundred eighty (180) days of the Demand
Effective Date and (y) the date on which all of the Restricted Stock covered
by the Demand Registration Statement has been sold to the public pursuant to
such registration statement in accordance with the intended method of
distribution thereof. Other than shares offered for its own account pursuant
to Section 2(d)(iii), the Company shall not permit any securities other than
Restricted Stock to be included in the Demand Registration Statement.   (d)
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2 to the contrary:   (i) in no
event will the Shareholders be entitled to request the Company to amend the
Shelf Registration Statement to permit an underwritten offering of Restricted
Stock pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or request the Company
file a Demand Registration Statement unless no less than ten percent (10%) of
the aggregate number of shares of Restricted Stock originally held by the
Shareholders are proposed to be sold pursuant to such underwritten
offering;   (ii) in no event will the Shareholders be entitled to request
the Company to amend the Shelf Registration Statement to permit or to file a
Demand Registration Statement for more than an aggregate of three (3)
underwritten offerings;   (iii) subject to Section 2(g), the Company shall
have the right to offer shares for its own account in the third such
underwritten offering, if any, pursuant to this Section 2 following the first
two (2) such underwritten offerings; and   (iv) the Company\'s obligation
to register for resale the Restricted Stock held by any Shareholder in any
Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 2 shall be contingent on such
Shareholder furnishing to the Company the information required by Section
4(c).   (e) the Company\'s obligation to amend the Shelf Registration
Statement to permit or to file a Demand Registration Statement for an
underwritten offering pursuant to this Section 2 shall not be deemed to have
been satisfied unless the Shelf Registration Statement or Demand Registration
Statement, as applicable, has become effective and remained effective in
compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as all
of the Restricted Stock offered in such underwritten offering shall have been
disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of disposition thereof
set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement or Demand Registration
Statement, as applicable.   (f) In any underwritten offering pursuant to
this Section 2, the participating Shareholders holding a majority of the
Restricted Stock proposed to be sold in such offering shall have the right to
select one managing underwriter, and such managing underwriter shall be the
sole managing underwriter for any such offering; provided that if the Company
offers shares for its own account in any such underwritten offering pursuant
to this Section 2 the Company shall also be entitled to select one managing
underwriter, and such underwriter, together with the underwriter selected by
the participating Shareholders, shall be the sole managing underwriters for
any such offering. The Company (together with the participating Shareholders)
shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting, as well as all
other documents customary in similar offerings, including, without
limitation, questionnaires, custody agreements, powers of attorney, lockup
agreements and indemnification agreements, as applicable.   (g) With
respect to the third underwritten offering, if any, pursuant to this Section
2 following the first two (2) such underwritten offerings, if the Company
exercises its right to offer shares for its own account in such offering and
the managing underwriter(s) for such underwritten offering advises the
Company and the participating Shareholders in writing that, in
such underwriter(s) opinion, the aggregate number of securities requested to
be included in such offering by the Company, if any, and the Shareholders
exceeds the largest number or amount of securities which can be sold without
reasonably expecting to have an adverse effect on such offering, including
the price at which such securities can be sold, the number of such securities
to be included in such registration shall be reduced and the Company and the
participating Shareholders shall include in such offering the number of
securities that in the opinion of the managing underwriter(s) can be sold
without adverse effect on the offering, allocated pro rata among the Company
and the participating Shareholders of the Restricted Stock on the basis of
the number of shares proposed to be sold by the Company and such
participating Shareholders in such underwritten offering. If any Shareholder
advises the managing underwriter(s) of any underwritten offering that the
shares of Restricted Stock covered by the registration statement cannot be
sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to such Shareholder,
then such Shareholder shall have the right to exclude its Restricted Stock
from such offering.   3. Incidental Registration.   (a) If the Company at
any time (other than pursuant to Section 2) proposes to register any of its
Common Stock under the Securities Act for sale to the public, whether for its
own account or for the account of other security holders or both (except with
respect to Registration Statements on Forms S-4, S-8 or another form not
available for registering the Restricted Stock for sale to the public or any
successor thereto), each such time it will give prompt written notice to all
holders of outstanding shares of Restricted Stock of its intention to do so
and of such holders\' rights under this Section 3, at least ten (10) business
days prior to the anticipated filing date of the registration statement
relating to such registration. Upon the written request of any such holder,
received by the Company within five (5) business days after receipt of the
Company\'s notice by the holder, to register any of its Restricted Stock, the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Restricted Stock as to
which registration shall have been so requested to be included in
the securities to be covered by the Registration Statement proposed to be
filed by the Company. Any such Shareholder may elect, in writing no less than
five (5) business days prior to the anticipated effective date of the
registration statement filed in connection with such registration, not to
register such securities in connection with such registration.   (b) In the
event that any registration pursuant to this Section 3 shall be, in whole or
in part, an underwritten public offering of Common Stock, the number of
shares of Restricted Stock to be included in such an underwriting may be
reduced (pro rata among the requesting holders based upon the number
of shares of Restricted Stock owned by such holders) if and to the extent
that the managing underwriter notifies the Company in writing that, in its
opinion, such inclusion would exceed the largest number or amount of
securities which can be sold without reasonably expecting to have an adverse
effect on such offering, including the price at which such securities can be
sold by the Company therein. The reduction referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be applied as follows: (i) if the Company effects
such registration for its account, the reduction shall be applied first, to
the securities of security holders of the Company (including the holders of
the Restricted Stock) that are entitled to, and are requested to be included
in, such registration, pro rata among all such security holders, based on the
number of securities held by such security holders, and second, to the
securities included in such registration by the Company, provided, however,
that if the time period set forth in Section 2(a) has expired without a
Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2 having been filed, the above
described order shall be reversed and (ii) if the Company effects such
registration for the account of other security holders, the reduction shall
be applied first, to the securities included in such registration by the
Company, second, to the securities of security holders of the Company
(including the holders of the Restricted Stock) which are entitled to, and
are requested to be included in, such registration pursuant to this Section 3
and similar piggy-back registration rights, pro rata among all such security
holders, based on the number of securities held by such security holders, and
third, to the securities included in such registration by the security
holders of the Company initiating such registration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, the Company may withdraw any Registration
Statement referred to in this Section 3 without thereby incurring any
liability to the holders of Restricted Stock.   (c) In any underwritten
offering pursuant to this Section 3 in which no less than ten percent (10%)
of the aggregate number of shares of Restricted Stock originally held by the
Shareholders are proposed to be sold, the participating Shareholders and the
Company shall each have the right to select one managing underwriter and such
managing underwriters shall be the sole managing underwriters for any such
offering. The Company (together with the participating Shareholders) shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter
or underwriters selected for such underwriting, as well as all other
documents customary in similar offerings, including, without limitation,
questionnaires, custody agreements, powers of attorney, lockup agreements and
indemnification agreements, as applicable. The participating Shareholders
shall have no right to select a managing underwriter if less than ten percent
(10%) of the aggregate number of shares of Restricted Stock originally held
by the Shareholders are proposed to be sold in such underwritten public
offering.   4. Registration Procedures.   (a) If and whenever the Company
is required by the provisions of Sections 2 or 3 to use reasonable best
efforts to effect the registration of any shares of Restricted Stock under
the Securities Act, the Company will, as expeditiously as reasonably
practicable:   (i) prepare and file with the Commission a Registration
Statement with respect to such securities and use commercially reasonable
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain
effective for the period of the distribution contemplated by Section
4(b);   (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments
and supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used
in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration
Statement effective for the period specified by Section 4(b) and comply with
the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of
all Restricted Stock covered by such Registration Statement in accordance
with the sellers\' intended method of disposition set forth in such
Registration Statement for such period;   (iii) furnish to each seller of
Restricted Stock and to each underwriter such number of copies of the
Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein (including each
preliminary prospectus), copies of any correspondence with the Commission or
its staff relating to such Registration Statement and such other documents as
such persons reasonably may request in order to facilitate the public sale or
other disposition of the Restricted Stock covered by such Registration
Statement;   (iv) use reasonable best efforts to register or qualify
the Restricted Stock covered by such Registration Statement under the State
Acts of such jurisdictions as the sellers of Restricted Stock or, in the case
of an underwritten public offering, the managing underwriter reasonably
shall request; provided, however, that the Company shall not for any such
purpose be required to qualify generally to transact business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to consent to
general service of process in any such jurisdiction;   (v) use reasonable
best efforts to list the Restricted Stock covered by such Registration
Statement with a national securities exchange (if such shares are not already
listed) and with each additional securities exchange on which the similar
securities of the Company are then listed;   (vi) immediately notify each
seller of Restricted Stock and each underwriter under such Registration
Statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event of which
the Company has knowledge as a result of which the prospectus contained in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light
of the circumstances then existing and, with the assistance of such seller,
the Company will prepare a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so
that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Restricted Stock,
such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;   (vii) if
the offering is underwritten and at the request of any seller of Restricted
Stock, use reasonable best efforts to furnish on the date that Restricted
Stock is delivered to the underwriters for sale pursuant to such
registration: (A) an opinion dated such date of counsel representing
the Company for the purposes of such registration, addressed to the
underwriters, stating that such Registration Statement has become effective
under the Securities Act and that (1) to the knowledge of such counsel, no
stop order suspending the effectiveness thereof has been issued and no
proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or
contemplated under the Securities Act, (2) the Registration Statement, the
related prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereof comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act (except
that such counsel need not express any opinion as to financial statements
contained therein), and (3) to such other matters as reasonably may be
requested by counsel for the underwriters and (B) a letter dated such date
from the independent public accountants retained by the Company, addressed to
the underwriters, stating that they are independent public accountants within
the meaning of the Securities Act and that, in the opinion of such
accountants, the financial statements of the Company included in the
Registration Statement or the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement
thereof, comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements of the Securities Act, and such letter shall
additionally cover such other financial matters (including information as to
the period ending no more than five business days prior to the date of such
letter) with respect to such registration as such underwriters reasonably may
request;   (viii) make available for inspection by each seller of
Restricted Stock, any underwriter participating in any distribution pursuant
to such Registration Statement, and any attorney, accountant or other agent
retained by such seller or underwriter, all financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the
Company\'s officers, directors and employees to supply all information
reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or
agent in connection with such Registration Statement;   (ix) after the
filing of the Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto,
the Company will promptly notify each selling holder of Restricted Stock
covered by such Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement issued or threatened by the Commission and, as promptly as
practicable, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the
entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered;   (x) cooperate with
the Shareholders and the managing underwriters, if any, to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Restricted Stock
to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such
Restricted Stock to be in such denominations and registered in such names as
the managing underwriters may request prior to any sale of the Restricted
Stock to the underwriters;   (xi) with respect to an underwritten offering
pursuant to this Agreement, make appropriate members of senior management of
the Company available (subject to consulting with them in advance as to
schedule) for customary participation in telephonic, in-person conferences or
"road show" presentations to potential investors;   (xii) promptly notify
the Shareholders, counsel to the Shareholders and the managing underwriter or
agent, (i) when the registration statement, or any post-effective amendment
to the registration statement, shall have become effective, or any supplement
to the prospectus or any amendment to the prospectus shall have been filed,
(ii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission, and (iii) of any
request of the Commission to amend the registration statement or amend or
supplement the prospectus or for additional information; and   (xiii)
otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules
and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its security
holders, within the required time periods, an earnings statement covering a
period of at least twelve (12) months, beginning with the first fiscal
quarter of the Company after the effective date of the registration statement
(as the term "effective date" is defined in Rule 158(c) under the Securities
Act), which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a)
of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder or any successor provisions
thereto.   (b) For purposes of Sections 4(a)(i) and (ii) and Section 2,
the period of distribution of Restricted Stock in a firm commitment
underwritten public offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter
has completed the distribution of all securities purchased by it or a period
of one hundred eighty (180) days, which ever first occurs, and the period of
distribution of Restricted Stock in any other registration shall be deemed to
extend until the earlier of the sale of all Restricted Stock covered thereby
or of one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date thereof.   (c)
In connection with each registration hereunder, the sellers of Restricted
Stock will furnish to the Company in writing such information with respect to
themselves, their beneficial ownership of Common Stock, and the proposed
distribution by them as reasonably shall be necessary in order to assure
compliance with federal securities laws, Commission rules and
applicable State Acts. The Company\'s obligation to register the Restricted
Stock held by any Shareholder in any Registration Statement shall be
contingent on such Shareholder furnishing to the Company the information
required by this Section 4(c). Moreover, no person may participate in any
underwritten offering hereunder unless such person (i) provides the
information required by this Section 4(c); (ii) agrees to sell such person\'s
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Company or the participating Shareholders, as applicable; and (iii)
completes and executes all questionnaires, custody agreements, powers of
attorney, lockup agreements, indemnification agreements, underwriting
agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements.   (d) In connection with each registration
pursuant to Sections 2 or 3 covering an underwritten public offering, the
Company and each selling Shareholder shall (i) enter into a written agreement
with the managing underwriter(s) selected in the manner herein provided in
such form and containing such provisions as are customary in the securities
business for such an arrangement between such underwriter and companies of
the Company\'s size and investment stature, (ii) regardless of whether the
agreement referred to in the foregoing clause (i) is entered into, make such
representations and warranties to the selling Shareholders and each of the
underwriters in form, substance and scope as are customarily made in
connection with an offering pursuant to any appropriate agreement or such
Registration Statement, (iii) deliver such documents and certificates,
including officers\' certificates, as may be customary in the circumstances
and reasonably requested by the selling Shareholders or the underwriters,
(iv) undertake such obligations relating to expense reimbursement,
indemnification and contribution as are provided in Sections 6 and 7 and (v)
take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or
facilitate the disposition of such Restricted Stock.   5. Suspension or
Delay. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may delay filing a Registration Statement or an amendment thereto,
and may withhold efforts to cause a Registration Statement or amendment
thereto to become effective if: (i) the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith after consultation with counsel that such action is
required by applicable law; (ii) the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with counsel that the filing or use of the
Registration Statement or amendment thereto would require the Company to
disclose material information, including without limitation the fact that the
Company is engaged in confidential negotiations regarding, or is in the
process of completing, any significant business transaction, the disclosure
of which would not be required in the absence of such registration statement,
and the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith that such
disclosure would be materially detrimental to the Company and its
stockholders; or (iii) the Company is engaged in, or prior to receiving such
request had determined and taken substantial steps to effect, an underwritten
public offering of Common Stock for its own account (other than an offering
pursuant to Form S-8, S-4 or any successor or similar form) and the managing
underwriter has advised the Company that such offers and sales by the
Shareholders will adversely affect such public offering. Each period referred
to above during which the use of a Registration Statement or amendment
thereto is delayed in accordance with this Section 5 shall be referred to
herein as a "Deferral Period". Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Company be entitled to declare more than three (3) Deferral Periods
in any 365-day period nor shall the aggregate number of days included in all
Deferral Periods exceed one hundred fifty (150) days in any 365-day period
without the consent of the Shareholders holding a majority of the Restricted
Stock at such time. The Company shall terminate a Deferral Period as soon as
practicable after the circumstances giving rise to the Company\'s right to
declare such Deferral Period cease to exist. The Company shall promptly give
the Shareholders written notice of a determination to commence a Deferral
Period, which notice shall contain a general statement of the reasons for
such Deferral Period and the anticipated length of such Deferral Period, and
shall notify the Shareholders upon the termination of each Deferral Period.
If, after a Registration Statement becomes effective, the Company advises the
holders of registered shares that the Company has determined in good faith
that the registration statement is required to be amended to comply with
applicable law or regulation, the holders of such registered shares shall
suspend any further sales of their registered shares until the Company
advises them that the registration statement has been amended.   6.
Expenses. All expenses incurred by the Company and the selling holders of
Restricted Stock in complying with Sections 2 and 3, including, without
limitation, all registration and filing and review fees, printing expenses,
fees and disbursements of counsel (including one counsel to the holders of
Restricted Stock) and independent public accountants for the Company, fees
and expenses (including counsel fees) incurred in connection with complying
with State Acts, fees of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(the "NASD"), fees of any securities exchange, transfer taxes, fees of
transfer agents and registrars, costs of insurance, messenger, telephone and
delivery expenses and reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for
the sellers of Restricted Stock, but excluding any Selling Expenses, are
called "Registration Expenses." Registration Expenses shall not include
underwriting discounts, selling commissions, fees and expenses of more than
one counsel to the selling holders of Restricted Stock and all such fees and
expenses are referred to as "Selling Expenses." The Company will pay
all Registration Expenses in connection with the Shelf Registration
Statement, the Demand Registration Statement and each Registration Statement
under Sections 2 or 3 of this Agreement. All Selling Expenses in connection
with each Registration Statement under Sections 2 and 3 shall be borne by
the participating Shareholders in proportion to the number of shares of
Restricted Stock sold by each, or by such participating Shareholders other
than the Company (except to the extent the Company shall be a seller) as they
may agree.   7. Indemnification and Contribution.   (a) In the event of a
registration of any of the Restricted Stock under the Securities Act pursuant
to Sections 2 or 3, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each seller
of such Restricted Stock thereunder, each underwriter of such Restricted
Stock thereunder and each other person, if any, who controls such seller or
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Shareholder or any such
controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such
action or claim), joint or several, to which such seller, underwriter or
controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement
under which such Restricted Stock was registered under the Securities Act
pursuant to Sections 2 or 3, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or
are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such seller, each such
underwriter and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, provided, however, that the
Company will not be liable in any such case if and to the extent that any
such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
so made in conformity with information furnished by any such seller, any such
underwriter or any such controlling person in writing specifically for use in
such Registration Statement or prospectus. It is agreed that the indemnity
agreement contained in this Section 7 shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such
settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (b) As a condition
precedent to the right of any holder of Restricted Stock to sell Restricted
Stock in a registration pursuant to this Agreement, such holder will agree
that in the event of a registration of any of the Restricted Stock under the
Securities Act pursuant to Sections 2 or 3, each seller of such Restricted
Stock thereunder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning
of the Securities Act, each officer of the Company who signs the Registration
Statement, each director of the Company, each underwriter and each person who
controls any underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against
all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the
Company or such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person may
become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in the Registration Statement under which such
Restricted Stock was registered under the Securities Act pursuant to Sections
2 or 3, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and will reimburse the Company and each such officer, director, underwriter
and controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by
them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action, provided, however, that such seller will
be liable hereunder in any such case if and only to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information pertaining to such seller,
as such, furnished in writing to the Company by such seller specifically for
use in such Registration Statement or prospectus, and provided, further,
however, that the liability of each seller hereunder shall not in any event
to exceed the net proceeds received by such seller from the sale of
Restricted Stock covered by such Registration Statement. It is agreed that
the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7(b) shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such seller
hereunder (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim
in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder,
notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission so to
notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which
it may have to such indemnified party other than under this Section 7 and
shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such
indemnified party under this Section 7 if and to the extent the indemnifying
party is prejudiced by such omission. In case any such action shall be
brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying
party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled
to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake
the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified
party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this
Section 7 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected, provided, however,
that, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to it which are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or
if the interests of the indemnified party reasonably may be deemed
to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party shall have the right to select a separate counsel and to assume such
legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action,
with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses
related to such participation to be reimbursed by the indemnifying party as
incurred.   (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to
joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any
holder of Restricted Stock exercising rights under this Agreement, or any
controlling person of any such holder, makes a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Section 7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a
final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the
expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that
such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the
fact that this Section 7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii)
contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such
selling holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which
indemnification is provided under this Section 7; then, and in each such
case, the Company and such holder will contribute to the aggregate losses,
claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after
contribution from others) in such proportion so as to reflect the relative
fault of each indemnifying party; provided, however, that, in any such case,
(A) no such holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
public offering price of all such Restricted Stock (net of Selling Expenses)
offered by it pursuant to such Registration Statement; and (B) no person or
entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person
or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of each selling
shareholder, on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such
party, and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company
and each Shareholder agree that it would not be just or equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to above. The amount paid or payable as
a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.   (e)
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 shall
remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any
termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of
any Shareholder or any person controlling any Shareholder, or by or on behalf
of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling
the Company, and (iii) any sale of Restricted Stock pursuant to any
Registration Statement.   (f) The obligations of the parties under this
Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which any party may otherwise
have to any other party.   (g) The indemnification and contribution
required by Sections 7(a), 7(b) and 7(d) shall be made by periodic payments
of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as
and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is
incurred.   8. Changes in Common Stock. If there is any change in the Shares
by way of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification,
or through a merger, consolidation, reorganization or recapitalization, or by
any other means, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the provisions
hereof so that the rights and privileges granted hereby shall continue with
respect to the Shares as so changed.   9. Rule 144 Reporting and
Termination of Company Obligations.   (a) The Company shall not be obligated
to register or include in any Registration Statement any Restricted Stock
held by a Shareholder if all Restricted Stock held by such Shareholder may be
publicly offered, sold and distributed without registration pursuant to Rule
144(k) under the Securities Act.   (b) With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission which may at any
time permit the sale of the Restricted Stock to the public without
registration, the Company shall:   (i) make and keep public information
available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act;   (ii) use reasonable best efforts to file with the
Commission in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the
Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and   (iii) furnish
to each holder of Restricted Stock forthwith upon request a written statement
by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of such
Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most
recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and
documents so filed by the Company as such holder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission allowing such
holder to sell any Restricted Stock without registration.   (c) The Company
shall take such further action and shall offer all reasonable and necessary
assistance including, without limitation, the delivery of a legal opinion
letter and instructions to the Company\'s stock transfer agent to enable the
sale by any Shareholder of Restricted Stock pursuant to Rule 144 or any
similar rule or regulation.   10. Lockup Agreements.   (a) In
consideration of the Company\'s obligations under this Agreement, each of the
Shareholders hereby agrees that in no event shall such Shareholder sell,
assign, convey, exchange, pledge, hypothecate, gift, dispose of or otherwise
part with any indicia or aspect of title, ownership or possession of, to or
in (collectively, a "Transfer") (i) any such Shares during the period ending
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) or (ii) in the aggregate more than fifty percent (50%) of such
Shares held by such Shareholder during the period ending eighteen (18) months
after the Effective Time.   (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions in Section
10(a), unless prohibited by applicable securities laws, a Shareholder shall
be permitted to effect a Transfer of Shares to an Affiliate of such
Shareholder or, if the Shareholder is a limited liability company, limited
partnership, corporation or trust, to its members, partners, shareholders or
beneficiaries, as applicable. Any such purported Transfer shall be void and
of no force unless the Shareholder shall provide written notice of the
proposed Transfer to the Company no less than ten (10) days prior to the
completion thereof and shall provide the Company with all certificates,
affidavits, representations or other documents reasonably necessary to
effectuate such proposed transfer under federal, state or other applicable
securities laws. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Affiliate" means,
with respect to any Shareholder, any person who directly or indirectly,
through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with, such Shareholder, and the term "control" means the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise, and the terms
"controlled" and "controlling" have meanings correlative thereto.   11.

Agreement by the Company has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate

-------------   4.1 Remedies. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that (a) the provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to
protect the proper and legitimate interests of the Parties and (b) the
Parties would be irreparably damaged in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that each of the Parties
shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement by any other Party without the
necessity of proving actual damages or of posting any bond, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof and thereof in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction, which rights shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other remedy to which the Parties may be
entitled hereunder or at law or equity.   4.2 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other
than the Parties, their respective successors and permitted transferees and
assigns.   4.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the documents
referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof.   4.4
Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
transferees and assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Parties; provided, however that the Company may

acquiring entity in connection with any business combination transaction,
reorganization or sale of substantially all the assets of the Company.

shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State

such choice of Laws ineffective.   4.7 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment
of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.   4.8 Severability. Any term or provision of
this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction. Upon any such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto will
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the obligations and restrictions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated to the extent possible.   4.9 Termination. This Agreement shall
automatically terminate as of the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective
Date.     [signatures on next pages]      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of
