A-35      AGREEMENT AND PLAN  OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION   This
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization ("Agreement") is made and
entered into as of August 28, 2000, by and among Applied Micro
Circuits Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); Mercury Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"); and MMC Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Exhibit A.   Recitals   A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to
effect a merger of Merger Sub into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Merger"). Upon
consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.   B. It is intended that
the Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").   C. The
respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
approved this Agreement and the Merger.   D. In order to induce Parent to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement: (i) certain stockholders of the
Company are executing voting agreements in favor of Parent (the "Company
Stockholder Voting Agreements"); and (ii) certain key employees of the
Company are executing employment and noncompetition agreements with Parent
and Merger Sub.   Agreement   The parties to this Agreement, intending to
be legally bound, agree as follows:  SECTION 1. Description of
Transaction   1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company
will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation").   1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").   1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cooley Godward LLP, 4365
Executive Drive, Suite 1100, San Diego, California, at 10:00 a.m. on a date
to be designated by Parent (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than
the second business day after the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7 shall have been so satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions). Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate
of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL (the
"Certificate of Merger") shall be duly executed by the Company and
concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing delivered
to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing. The Merger
shall become effective upon the date and time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
such other date and time as Parent and the Company may mutually agree and
include in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").   A-1   
1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:   (a) the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time;   (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and   (c) the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.   1.5 Conversion of
Shares.   (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
stockholder of the Company:   (i) any shares of Company Common Stock then
held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (or held in
the treasury of the Company) shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor;   (ii) any shares of Company Common
Stock then held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor;   (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)"
above and subject to Sections 1.5(c), 1.5(d) and 1.5(e), each share of
Company Common Stock then outstanding shall be converted into the right to
receive that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio (as defined in Section 1.5(b)); and   (iv) each share of the Common
Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub then outstanding shall be
converted into one share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
(b) For purposes of this Agreement the "Exchange Ratio" (as such
Exchange Ratio may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.5(c)) shall be
.619; provided however, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which
Parent shall be obligated to issue in connection with the Merger shall be no
more than 20% of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding as
of the Effective Time.   (c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock are changed into, or there is a record date for a transaction in
which the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock
will be changed into, a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Exchange Ratio shall
be appropriately adjusted.   (d) If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
the Company or under which the Company has any rights, then the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common
Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk
of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such
shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
legends. The Company shall take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any
such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement.   (e) No fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no
certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such
fraction of a share and   A-2   upon surrender of such holder\'s Company
Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in cash the dollar
amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of Parent Common
Stock on The Nasdaq National Market on the date the Merger becomes
effective.   1.6 Closing of the Company\'s Transfer Books. At the Effective
Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b)
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of
Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 1.7.   1.7 Exchange of Certificates.  
(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange
agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time
and in any event within three (3) business days, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent (i) a sufficient number of certificates to cover the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1, and (ii)
cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with Section 1.5(e). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so
deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are
referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail
to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company
Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (1) the holder of such Company
Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock), and (2) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be
canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7, each Company
Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock) as contemplated by
Section 1. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate.   (c) No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive in the Merger until such holder surrenders
such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which
time such   A-3   holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of
applicable escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and
distributions, without interest).   (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the
date 180 days after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock
Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Parent Common Stock, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   (e) Each of the
Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under
any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.   (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common
Stock or to any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash
amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.   1.8 No
Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal
rights shall be available to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger.   1.9 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax
purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby
adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury
Regulations.   1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such
action.  SECTION 2. Representations and Warranties of the Company   The
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub (subject to such
exceptions or qualifications as are disclosed in writing in the
disclosure schedule supplied by the Company to Parent dated as of the date
hereof (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), which disclosure shall provide an
exception to or otherwise qualify only those representations and warranties
of the Company contained in the section of this Agreement corresponding to
the part or section reference of the Company Disclosure Schedule where such
disclosure appears and such exceptions or qualifications shall not be deemed
to be an exception to, or qualify, any other representation or warranty) as
follows:   2.1 Due Organization; Subsidiaries. Each of the Acquired
Corporations (as defined below) is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has all necessary power and authority: (i) to conduct its
business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted;
(ii) to own and use its assets in the manner in which its assets are
currently owned and used; and (iii) to perform its obligations under all
Contracts by which it is bound. Each of the Acquired Corporations is
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing,
under   A-4   the laws of all jurisdictions where the nature of its
business requires such qualification and where the failure to be so qualified
would have a Material Adverse Effect on any of the Acquired Corporations. The
Company has delivered to Parent accurate and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter or organizational
documents of each of the Acquired Corporations, including all amendments
thereto. The Company has no Subsidiaries, except for the corporations
identified in Part 2.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. (The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the "Acquired
Corporations"). None of the Acquired Corporations has any equity interest or
similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any Entity, other than (i)
the Company\'s interest in its Subsidiaries identified in Part 2.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, or (ii) any interest in any publicly traded
company held for investment and comprising less than five percent of the
outstanding capital stock of such company. None of the Acquired Corporations
has, at any time, been a general partner of, or has otherwise been liable for
any of the debts or other obligations of, any general partnership, limited
partnership or other Entity.   2.2 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement.
Subject to obtaining the requisite approval of the Company\'s stockholders in
accordance with the DGCL, the Company has the absolute and unrestricted
right, power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations under
this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company (at a meeting duly
called and held) has (a) determined that the Merger is advisable and fair and
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (b) authorized and
approved the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and approved the Merger, (c) recommended the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of Company Common Stock and directed that this
Agreement and the Merger be submitted for consideration by the Company\'s
stockholders at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined in Section
5.2), and (d) adopted a resolution having the effect of causing the Company
not to be subject to any state takeover law or similar Legal Requirement that
might otherwise apply to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their terms, subject to (i) laws of general application
relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (ii) rules
of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. Prior to the execution of the Company Stockholder Voting
Agreements, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Company
Stockholder Voting Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby. As a
result of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Board of
Directors of the Company, no state takeover statute or similar
Legal Requirement applies or purports to apply to the Merger, this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   2.3 Capitalization,
Etc.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i)
100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock; and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share. As of August 24, 2000, 33,109,850
shares of Company Common Stock have been issued and are outstanding and no
shares of the Company\'s Preferred Stock have been issued or are outstanding.
No shares of capital stock of the Company are held in the Company\'s
treasury. All of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been
duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and nonassessable.
There are no shares of Company Common Stock held by any of the Company\'s
Subsidiaries. None of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is
entitled or subject to any preemptive right, right of participation, right of
maintenance or any similar right or subject to any right of first refusal in
favor of the Company and there is no Acquired Corporation Contract relating
to the voting or registration of, or restricting any Person from purchasing,
selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of (or granting any option or
similar right with respect to), any shares of Company Common Stock. None of
the Acquired Corporations is under any obligation, or is bound by any
Contract pursuant to which it may become obligated, to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.   (b) As
of August 24, 2000: (i) 931,137 shares of Company Common Stock are subject to

the Company\'s 1993 Stock Plan; (ii) 5,621,826 shares   A-5   of Company

outstanding under the Company\'s 1997 Stock Plan; (iii) 130,000 shares of
Company Common Stock are subject to issuance pursuant to stock options
granted and outstanding under the Company\'s Director Option Plan; and (iv)
577,664 shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for future

"Company ESPP"), 52,670 of which are subject to issuance pursuant to stock
options granted and outstanding under the Company ESPP. (Stock options
granted by the Company pursuant to the 1993 Stock Plan, the 1997 Stock Plan
and the 1997 Director Stock Plan are referred to collectively herein as
"Company Options.") Part 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the following information with respect to each Company Option outstanding as
of the date of this Agreement: (i) the particular plan pursuant to which such
Company Option was granted; (ii) the name of the optionee; (iii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option; (iv) the
exercise price of such Company Option; (v) the date on which such Company
Option was granted; (vi) the extent to which such Company Option is vested
and exercisable as of the date of this Agreement; and (vii) the date on which
such Company Option expires. The Company has delivered to Parent accurate and
complete copies of all stock option plans pursuant to which the Company has
granted Company Options, and the forms of all stock option agreements
evidencing such options to the extent such plans or agreements have not been
filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section
2.4(a)).   (c) Except as set forth in Sections 2.3(a) or 2.3(b), as of the
date hereof there is no: (i) outstanding subscription, option, call, warrant
or right (whether or not currently exercisable) to acquire any shares of the
capital stock or other securities of any of the Acquired Corporations; (ii)
outstanding security, instrument or obligation that is or may become
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of the capital stock or other
securities of any of the Acquired Corporations; (iii) rights agreement,

to or provide a basis for the assertion of a claim by any Person to the
effect that such Person is entitled to acquire or receive any shares of
capital stock or other securities of any of the Acquired Corporations.  
(d) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, all outstanding
Company Options and all outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Subsidiary of the Company have been issued and granted in compliance with (i)
all applicable securities laws and other applicable Legal Requirements, and
(ii) all requirements set forth in applicable Contracts. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries
have been duly authorized and are validly issued, are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned beneficially and of record by the Company, free
and clear of any Encumbrances.   2.4 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.  
(a) The Company has made available to Parent all registration
statements, proxy statements and other statements, reports, schedules, forms
and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 1999
(the "Company SEC Documents"). All statements, reports, schedules, forms and
other documents required to have been filed by the Company with the SEC
since December 31, 1999 have been so filed. As of the time it was filed with
the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing): (i) each of the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (as the case may be); and (ii) none
of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   (b) The
financial statements (including any related notes) contained in the Company
SEC Documents (the "Company Financial Statements"): (i) complied as to form
in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods

date hereof, Part 2.6(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, registered trademarks,
trademark applications, registered copyrights and copyright applications
owned by any of the Acquired Corporations. As of the date hereof, Part
2.6(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies any ongoing royalty
or payment obligations in excess of $100,000 with respect to,
each Proprietary Asset that is licensed or otherwise made available to any of
the Acquired Corporations by any Person and is material to the business of
the Acquired Corporations (except for any Proprietary Asset that is licensed
to any Acquired Corporation under any third party software license generally
available to the public), and identifies the Contract under which such
Proprietary Asset is being licensed or otherwise made available to such
Acquired Corporation. The Acquired Corporations have good and valid title to
all of the Acquired Corporation Proprietary Assets identified or required to
be identified in Part 2.6(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, free and
clear of all Encumbrances, except for (i) any lien for current taxes not yet
due and payable, and (ii) minor liens that have arisen in the ordinary course
of business and that do not (individually or in the aggregate) materially
detract from the value of the Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset subject
thereto or materially impair the operations of the Acquired Corporations. The
Acquired Corporations have a valid right to use, license and otherwise
exploit all Proprietary Assets identified in Part 2.6(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. None of the Acquired Corporations has developed jointly
with any other Person any Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset that is
material to the business of the Acquired Corporations and with respect to
which such other Person has any rights. There is no Acquired Corporation
Contract (with the exception of end user license agreements in the form
previously delivered by the Company to Parent) pursuant to which any Person
has any right (whether or not currently exercisable) to use, license or
otherwise exploit any Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset that is material
to the business of the Acquired Corporations.   (b) The Acquired
Corporations have taken reasonable measures and precautions to protect and
maintain the confidentiality, secrecy and value of all material Acquired
Corporation Proprietary Assets (except Acquired Corporation Proprietary
Assets whose value would be unimpaired by disclosure). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each current or former employee of any
Acquired Corporation who is or was involved in, or who has contributed to,
the creation or development of any Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset has
executed and delivered to such Acquired Corporation an agreement (containing
no exceptions to or exclusions from the scope of its coverage) that is
substantially identical to the form of Confidential Information and Invention
Assignment Agreement previously delivered by the Company to Parent, and (ii)
each current and former consultant and independent contractor to any Acquired
Corporation who is or was involved in, or who has contributed to,
the creation or development of any Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset
has executed and delivered to the Company an agreement (containing no
exceptions to or exclusions from the scope of its coverage) that is
substantially identical to the form of Consultant Confidential Information
and Invention Assignment Agreement previously delivered to Parent. No current
or former employee, officer, director, stockholder, consultant or independent
contractor has any right, claim or interest in or with respect to any
Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset.   (c) To the best of the knowledge
of the Company: (i) all patents, trademarks, service marks and copyrights
held by any of the Acquired Corporations are valid, enforceable and
subsisting; (ii) none of the Acquired Corporation Proprietary Assets and no
Proprietary Asset that is currently being developed by any of the Acquired
Corporations (either by itself or with any other Person) infringes,
misappropriates or conflicts with any Proprietary Asset owned or used by any
other Person; (iii) none of the products, systems, software, computer, source
code, models, algorithm, formula, inventions, designs or technology that has
been designed, created, developed, assembled, manufactured or sold by any of
the Acquired Corporations is infringing, misappropriating or making any
unlawful or unauthorized use of any Proprietary Asset owned or used by
any   A-8   other Person, or has at any time infringed, misappropriated
or made any unlawful or unauthorized use of any Proprietary Asset owned or
used by any other Person; (iv) none of the Acquired Corporations has received
any notice or other communication (in writing) of any actual, alleged,
possible or potential infringement, misappropriation or unlawful or
unauthorized use of, any Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other Person;
and (v) no other Person is infringing, misappropriating or making any
unlawful or unauthorized use of, and no Proprietary Asset owned or used by
any other Person infringes or conflicts with, any material Acquired
Corporation Proprietary Asset. The Acquired Corporation Proprietary Assets
constitute all the Proprietary Assets necessary to enable each of the
Acquired Corporations to conduct its business in the manner in which such
business has been and is being conducted. None of the Acquired Corporations
has (i) licensed any of the material Acquired Corporation Proprietary Asset
to any Person on an exclusive basis, or (ii) entered into any covenant not to
compete or Contract limiting its ability to exploit fully any material
Acquired Corporation Proprietary Assets or to transact business in any market
or geographical area or with any Person.   2.7 Contracts.   (a) Part 2.7
of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Acquired Corporation
Contract not filed as an exhibit to the Company SEC Documents that, as of the
date hereof, constitutes a "Material Contract". For purposes of this
Agreement, each of the following shall be deemed to constitute a "Material
Contract":   (i) any Contract that is required by the rules and regulations
of the SEC to be described in the Company SEC Documents or to be filed as an
exhibit thereto;   (ii) any Contract relating to the employment of any
employee, and any Contract pursuant to which any of the Acquired Corporations
is or may become obligated to make any severance, termination, bonus or
relocation payment or any other payment (other than payments in respect of
salary) in excess of $50,000, to any current or former employee or director
or any Contract which provides for the acceleration of vesting of any options
or acceleration of other rights to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock;   (iii) any Acquired Corporation Contract relating to the
acquisition, transfer, development, sharing or license of any material
Proprietary Asset (except for any Acquired Corporation Contract pursuant to
which (A) any material Proprietary Asset is licensed to the Acquired
Corporations under any third party software license generally available to
the public at a cost of no more than $50,000, or (B) any material Proprietary
Asset is licensed by any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person on a non-
exclusive basis);   (iv) any Contract which provides for indemnification of
any officer, director, employee or agent;   (v) any Contract imposing any
restriction on the right or ability of any Acquired Corporation to (A)
compete with any other Person, (B) acquire any material product or other
material asset or any services from any other Person, sell any material
product or other material asset to or perform any services for any other
Person or transact business or deal in any other manner with any other
Person, (C) develop or distribute any material technology, (D) make, have
made, use or sell any current products or products under development, or (E)
acquire any capital stock or other security of any Person;   (vi) any
contract that contemplates or involves payment or delivery of cash or other
consideration in an amount or having a value in excess of $100,000 in the
aggregate, or contemplates or involves the performance of services having a
value in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate;   (vii) any other Contract, if
a breach of such Acquired Corporation Contract would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations; and  
(viii) any Contract requiring that any of the Acquired Corporations give any
notice or provide any information to any Person prior to considering
or accepting any Acquisition Proposal or similar proposal, or prior to
entering into any discussions, agreement, arrangement or understanding
relating to any Acquisition Transaction or similar transaction.   (b) Each
Material Contract is valid and in full force and effect, and is enforceable
in accordance with its terms against the Company, and to the Company\'s
knowledge, against the other party thereto, subject to   A-9   (i) laws
of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors, and (ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies. The Company has delivered to Parent an
accurate and complete copy of each Material Contract. The Company is not a
party to any "standstill" or similar agreement prohibiting any Person from
acquiring any equity securities of the Company.   (c) None of the Acquired
Corporations has violated or breached, or committed any default under, any
Material Contract, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no other Person has
violated or breached, or committed any default under, any Material
Contract.   (d) To the Company\'s knowledge, no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time) would reasonably be expected to (i) give any Person the right to
declare a default or exercise any remedy under any Material Contract; (ii)
give any person the right to receive or require a significant rebate,
significant chargeback, significant penalty or significant change in delivery
schedule under any Material Contract; (iii) give any Person the right to
accelerate the maturity or performance of any Material Contract; or (iv) give
any Person the right to cancel, terminate or modify any Material Contract in
each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations.   2.8 Sale of Products;
Performance of Services. Each product sold or licensed by any of the Acquired
Corporations to any Person conformed and complied in all respects with the
terms and requirements of any applicable warranty or other Contract and with
all applicable Legal Requirements at the time it was sold except to the
extent that any nonconformance or noncompliance would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquired Corporations.   2.9 Liabilities. As of the date of this Agreement,
none of the Acquired Corporations has any accrued, contingent or other
liabilities of any nature, either matured or unmatured (whether or not
required to be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and whether due or to become due),
except for: (a) liabilities identified as such in the "liabilities" column of
the Company Balance Sheet; and (b) normal and recurring liabilities that have
been incurred by the Acquired Corporations since the Company Balance Sheet
Date in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices
which have not resulted in any material increase in the Company\'s
liabilities from those disclosed or provided for in the Company Balance Sheet
or in the related notes.   2.10 Compliance with Legal Requirements. Each of
the Acquired Corporations is, and at all times since December 31, 1999 has
been, in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, except where the
failure to comply with such Legal Requirements has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Corporations. Since December 31, 1999, none of the Acquired Corporations has
received any notice or other communication from any Governmental Body
regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure to comply with, any
Legal Requirement, except where such violation or noncompliance would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Corporations.   2.11 Governmental Authorizations. Each of the Acquired
Corporations holds all material Governmental Authorizations necessary to
enable such Acquired Corporation to conduct its business in the manner in
which such business is currently being conducted and as proposed to be
conducted. All such Governmental Authorizations are valid and in full force
and effect. Each Acquired Corporation is, and at all times since December 31,
1999 has been, in compliance with the terms and requirements of such
Governmental Authorizations except where the failure to comply with such
terms and requirements has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Corporations, since December 31, 1999, none of the Acquired Corporations has
received any notice or other communication from any Governmental Body
regarding (a) any actual or possible violation of or failure to comply with
any term or requirement of any Governmental Authorization, or (b) any actual
or possible revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or
modification of any Governmental Authorization.   A-10    2.12 Tax
Matters. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of any of the Acquired
Corporations with any Governmental Body with respect to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Acquired Corporation Returns") (a)
have been or will be filed on or before the applicable due date (including
any extensions of such due date), and (b) have been, or will be when filed,
prepared in all material respects in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. All amounts shown on the Acquired Corporation Returns to be due
on or before the Closing Date have been or will be paid on or before the
Closing Date. The Company Financial Statements fully accrue all actual and
contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through the
dates thereof in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
There are no unsatisfied liabilities for material Taxes (including
liabilities for interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon and related
expenses) with respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document
received by any Acquired Corporation with respect to any material Tax (other
than liabilities for Taxes asserted under any such notice of deficiency or
similar document which are being contested in good faith by the Acquired
Corporations and with respect to which adequate reserves for payment have
been established). There are no liens for material Taxes upon any of the
assets of any of the Acquired Corporations except liens for current Taxes not
yet due and payable. No extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any of the Acquired Corporation Returns has been granted (by
the Company or any other Person), and no such extension or waiver has been
requested from any Acquired Corporation other than an extension resulting
from the filing of a Tax Return after its due date in the ordinary course of
business. No claim or Legal Proceeding is pending or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, has been threatened against or with respect to any Acquired
Corporation in respect of any material Tax. None of the Acquired Corporations
has entered into or become bound by any agreement or consent pursuant to
Section 341(f) of the Code. None of the Acquired Corporations has been, and
none of the Acquired Corporations will be, required to include any adjustment
in taxable income for any tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section
481 or 263A of the Code or any comparable provision under state or foreign
Tax laws as a result of transactions or events occurring, or
accounting methods employed, prior to the Closing. There is no agreement,
plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any employee or independent
contractor or former employee or independent contractor of any of the
Acquired Corporations that, considered individually or considered
collectively with any other such Contracts, will, or could reasonably be
expected to, give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G or Section 162m of the
Code. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or Contract whereby the
Company would be obligated to pay any excise taxes due from any employee of
the Company. None of the Acquired Corporations is a party to any Contract to
compensate any individual for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of
the Code. None of the Acquired Corporations is, or has ever been, a party to
or bound by any tax indemnity agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax
allocation agreement or similar Contract, including any obligation arising by
reason of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6, and none of the Acquired
Corporations has or, by reason of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, will have any liability or obligation
under any tax indemnity agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation
agreement or similar Contract. None of the Acquired Corporations have made
any distribution of stock of any "controlled corporation," as that term is
defined by Section 355(a)(1) of the Code.   2.13 Employee and Labor Matters;

all employee pension benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")), all
employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and all
other bonus, stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation,
supplemental retirement, severance, perquisites, fringe benefits and other
similar benefit plans, programs or arrangements (including a specific
identification of those which contain change of control provisions or pending
change of control provisions), and any employment, executive compensation or
severance agreements (including a specific identification of those which
contain change of control provisions or pending change of control
provisions), written or otherwise, as amended, modified or supplemented, for
the benefit of, or relating to, any foreign or domestic former or current
employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant (or any of
their beneficiaries) of any Acquired Corporation or any other Entity (whether
or not incorporated) which is a member of a controlled group which includes
any of the   A-11   Acquired Corporations or which is under common
control with any of the Acquired Corporations within the meaning of Sections
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(a) (14) or (b) of ERISA,
as well as each plan with respect to which any of the Acquired Corporations
could incur liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
(collectively, the "Company Employee Plans"). The Company has made available
to Parent, in a reasonable time, place and manner, copies of (i) each such
written Company Employee Plan (or a written description of any Company
Employee Plan which is not written) and all related trust agreements,
insurance and other contracts (including policies), summary plan
descriptions, summaries of material modifications, registration
statements (including all attachments), prospectuses and communications
distributed to plan participants, (ii) the three most recent annual reports

U.S. Department of Labor with respect to each Company Employee Plan required
to make such filing, (v) the most recent favorable determination letters

be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (and, if an application for
such determination is pending, a copy of the application for such
determination), and (vi) financial and other information regarding current
and projected liabilities with respect to each Company Employee Plan for
which the filings described in (ii), (iii) or (iv) above are not required
under ERISA.   (b) (i) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or
provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person
(other than continuation coverage to the extent required by law, whether
pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 or
otherwise), and none of the Company Employee Plans is a "multiemployer plan"
as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA; (ii) no party in interest
or disqualified person (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA and Section 4975
of the Code) has at any time engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Company Employee Plan which could subject any of the Acquired Corporations,
directly or indirectly, to a material tax, penalty or other material
liability for prohibited transactions under ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code; (iii) no fiduciary of any Company Employee Plan has breached any of the
responsibilities or obligations imposed upon fiduciaries under Title I of
ERISA, which breach would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on any of the Acquired Corporations; (iv) all Company Employee Plans
have been established and maintained substantially in accordance with their
terms and have operated in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Legal Requirements, and may by their terms be amended and/or
terminated at any time subject to applicable Legal Requirements and the terms
of each Company Employee Plan, and each of the Acquired Corporations has
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under,
and are not in any material respect in default under or in violation of, any
Company Employee Plan, and none of the Acquired Corporations has any
knowledge of any default or violation by any other Person with respect to,
any of the Company Employee Plans; (v) each Company Employee Plan which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject
of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (or
comparable letter, such as an opinion or notification letter as to the form
of plan adopted by one or more Acquired Corporations), and, to the Company\'s
knowledge, nothing has occurred which may reasonably be expected to impair
such determination; (vi) all contributions required to be made with respect
to any Company Employee Plan pursuant to Section 412 of the Code, or the
terms of the Company Employee Plan or any collective bargaining agreement,
have been made on or before their due dates (including any extensions
thereof); (vii) with respect to each Company Employee Plan, no "reportable
event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event
for which the 30-day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations
to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred for which there is any material
outstanding liability to any Acquired Corporation nor would the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the execution of this
Agreement) constitute a reportable event for which the 30-day notice
requirement has not been waived; and (viii) none of the Acquired Corporations
has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any material liability under
Title IV of ERISA including, without limitation, any material liability
arising out of or resulting from an event described in Section 4062, 4063 or
4041 of ERISA (other than liability for premium payments to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") arising in the ordinary
course).   A-12    (c) (i) The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any Company Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA
(each, a "Company Defined Benefit Plan"); (ii) the Company Defined Benefit
Plans have no accumulated or waived funding deficiencies within the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code nor have any extensions of any amortization period
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or 302 of ERISA been applied
for with respect thereto; (iii) as of January 1, 1999, the present value of
the benefit liabilities (within the meaning of Section 4041 of ERISA) of the
Company Defined Benefit Plans, determined on an ongoing basis using the
actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial
report prepared by such plan\'s actuary with respect to such plan\'s most
recently completed fiscal year, does not exceed by more than $1,000,000 the
value of the Company Defined Benefit Plans\' assets and to the knowledge of
the Company, nothing has occurred since the end of the most recently
completed fiscal year that would adversely affect the funding status of such
plans; (iv) all applicable premiums required to be paid to the PBGC with
respect to the Company Defined Benefit Plans have been paid; (v) no facts or
circumstances exist with respect to any Company Defined Benefit Plan which
would give rise to a lien on the assets of any Acquired Corporation under
Section 4068 of ERISA or otherwise; and (vi) as of the date
hereof, substantially all of the assets of the Company Defined Benefit Plans
are readily marketable securities or insurance contracts.   (d) (i) None of
the Acquired Corporations has ever maintained an employee stock ownership
plan (within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code) or any other
Company Employee Plan that invests in Company capital stock; (ii) since
December 31, 1998, none of the Acquired Corporations has proposed or agreed
to any increase in benefits under any Company Employee Plan (or the creation
of new benefits) or change in employee coverage which would
materially increase the expense of maintaining any Company Employee Plan;
(iii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not result in an increase in the amount of compensation or benefits or
accelerate the vesting or timing of payment of any benefits or compensation
payable in respect of any employee; (iv) no person will be entitled to any
severance benefits under the terms of any Company Employee Plan as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(v) none of the Acquired Corporations will be denied an income tax deduction
pursuant to Section 162(m) or 280G of the Code.   (e) Each Company Employee
Plan covering non-U.S. employees (a "Company International Plan") has been
maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all applicable Legal Requirements (including any
special provisions relating to registered or qualified plans where such
Company International Plan was intended to so qualify) and has been
maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. The fair
market value of the assets of each funded Company International Plan, if any,
(or the liability of each funded Company International Plan funded through
insurance) is sufficient to procure or provide for the benefits accrued
thereunder through the Effective Time according to the actuarial assumptions
and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to the
Company International Plan.   (f) The fiduciary liability insurance policies
in effect covering the fiduciaries of the Company Employee Plans (including
the Acquired Corporations) are set forth on Part 2.13(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.   (g) (i) there are no controversies pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, between any of the Acquired
Corporations and any of their respective employees, which controversies have
had, or would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Corporations; (ii) none of the
Acquired Corporations is in breach of any material collective bargaining
agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by any
of the Acquired Corporations which would reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Corporations, nor does the Company know of any activities or proceedings of
any labor union to organize any significant number of such employees; and
(iii) none of the Acquired Corporations is in breach of any material
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract, nor has any
knowledge of any activities or proceedings of any labor unions to organize
employees, or of any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or threats
thereof, by or with respect to any employees (foreign or domestic) of any of
the   A-13   Acquired Corporations which would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Acquired Corporations. The Company is not obligated to make any payments or
provide any benefits to any Person under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, as amended.   2.14 Environmental Matters. Each of
the Acquired Corporations is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes the possession by
each of the Acquired Corporations of all permits and other Governmental
Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance
with the terms and conditions thereof. None of the Acquired Corporations has
received any notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise), whether
from a Governmental Body, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges
that any of the Acquired Corporations is not in compliance with any
Environmental Law, and, to the Company\'s knowledge, there are no
circumstances that may prevent or interfere with the compliance by any of the
Acquired Corporations with any Environmental Law in the future. Except as to
the Company, to the Company\'s knowledge, no current or prior owner of any
property leased or controlled by any of the Acquired Corporations
has received any notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise),
whether from a Governmental Body, citizens group, employee or otherwise, that
alleges that such current or prior owner or any of the Acquired Corporations
is not in compliance with any Environmental Law. To the Company\'s knowledge,
all property that is or has been leased to, controlled by or used by the
Acquired Corporations, and all surface water, groundwater and soil associated
with or adjacent to such property is in clean and healthful condition and is
free of any material environmental contamination of any nature and none of
the Acquired Corporations has any liability for any clean-up or remediation
under any Environmental Law or the exposure of any individual to Materials

Body with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (2) keep the other party informed as to the status of any
such Legal Proceeding or threat, and (3) promptly inform the other party of

analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any Legal Proceeding under or

the Company and Parent will permit authorized Representatives of the other
party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any such Legal

take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with
respect to its or its Subsidiaries\' ability to retain, any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, provided that any such action is conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger and such action when taken together with any
similar action by Parent would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
at and after the Effective Time.   A-23    5.4 Stock Options.   (a)
Subject to Section 5.4(b), at the Effective Time, all rights with respect to
Company Common Stock under each Company Option then outstanding shall be
converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Common Stock, and
Parent shall assume each such Company Option in accordance with the terms (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the stock option plan
under which it was issued and the terms of the stock option agreement by
which it is evidenced. From and after the Effective Time, (i) each Company
Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common
Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such
Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole share,
(iii) the per share exercise price under each such Company Option shall be
adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under such Company Option
by the Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent, and (iv) any
restriction on the exercise of any such Company Option shall continue in full
force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided,
however, that each Company Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this
Section 5.4(a) shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction
effected subsequent to the Effective Time. Parent shall file with the SEC, no
later than 10 business days after the date on which the Merger becomes
effective, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Company Options and the
Company ESPP Options assumed by Parent in accordance with this Section
5.4(a).   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
that may be necessary (under the plans pursuant to which Company Options are
outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.4
and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company
Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically
provided in this Section 5.4.   (c) At the Effective Time all outstanding
rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP ("Purchase
Rights") shall be converted (in accordance with the Exchange Ratio) into
rights to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (with the number of shares
rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase price as of the
offering date for each offering period in effect as of the Effective Time
rounded up to the nearest whole cent). All such converted Purchase Rights
shall be assumed by Parent, and each offering period in effect under the ESPP
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be continued in accordance with
the terms of the ESPP until the end of such offering period. No additional
offering periods will be granted under the ESPP following the Effective Time,
provided that references to the Company in the ESPP and related documents
shall mean Parent (except that the purchase price as of the enrollment date
for a relevant period shall be determined with respect to the fair market
value of the Company Common Stock on such date, as adjusted hereby). Parent
agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, the Company\'s employees not
participating in an offering which has been continued under the Company\'s
ESPP may participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by Parent
(the "Parent ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent ESPP,
and that service with the Company shall be treated as service with Parent for
purposes of determining eligibility of the Company\'s employees under
the Parent ESPP.   5.5 Employee Benefits. Parent agrees that all employees
of the Company who continue employment with Parent or the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be
eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporation\'s
retirement, health, vacation and other non-equity based employee benefit
plans; provided, however, that (a) nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any such retirement, health, vacation or
other employee benefit plan at any time, and (b) if Parent or the Surviving
Corporation terminates any such retirement, health, vacation or other
employee benefit plan, then, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in Parent\'s health, vacation and other non- equity based
employee benefit plans, to substantially the same extent as employees of
Parent in similar positions and at similar grade levels. With respect to such
benefits and to the extent permitted under the applicable employee benefit
plans of Parent,   A-24   credit for service accrued by Continuing
Employees (and eligible dependents) for employment with any Acquired
Corporation prior to the Effective Time shall be recognized (except to the
extent necessary to prevent duplication of benefits), any pre-existing
condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-
existing condition under a similar or corresponding Company Employee Plan)
and eligibility waiting periods applicable to any Continuing employee of an
Acquired Corporation under any group health plan shall be waived, and
employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under any Company Employee
Plan during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Employee Plan.
Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed
to create a right in any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to any other
binding written agreement between an employee and Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be
"at will" employment.   5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.  
(a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of those Persons who
are or were directors and officers of the Company (the "Indemnified Persons")
for acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in
the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) and as provided in the indemnification agreements
between the Company and said Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement), shall survive the Merger and shall be observed by the
Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
the Surviving Corporation to observe such rights, to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law.   (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect, for the
benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of
this Agreement (the "Existing Policy"); provided, however, that (i) Parent
may substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or policies of no less
favorable coverage, and (ii) Parent shall not be required to pay annual
premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess
of 175% of the annual premium payable under the Existing Policy as of the
date hereof (which the Company has represented to Parent is $217,373 per
annum). In the event any future annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or
any substitute policies) exceed 175% of such current annual premium, Parent
shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing Policy (or
any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a
premium equal to 175% of such current annual premium.   5.7 Additional
Agreements.   (a) Subject to Section 5.7(b), Parent and the Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to Section 5.7(b), each party to this Agreement (i)
shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be
made and given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to
any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in
connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (iii) shall use all reasonable efforts to lift any
restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger. The Company shall
promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice
given and each such Consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-Closing
Period.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement to: (i)
dispose or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or
transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations
to dispose of any assets; (ii) discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries
to discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of
the Acquired Corporations to discontinue offering any product or service;
(iii) license or otherwise make available, or   A-25   cause any of its
Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available, to any Person, any
technology, software or other Proprietary Asset, or to commit to cause any of
the Acquired Corporations to license or otherwise make available to any
Person any technology, software or other Proprietary Asset; (iv)
hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets
or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to
cause any of the Acquired Corporations to hold separate any assets or
operations; (v) make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment
(to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or
the future operations of any of the Acquired Corporations; or (vi) contest
any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger if Parent determines in good
faith that contesting such Legal Proceeding might not be advisable.   (c)
During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of (i) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs, arises
or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would cause or constitute
a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by the Company
in this Agreement if such representation or warranty had been made as of the
time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact
or circumstance, or such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred,
arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any
material breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company that, in
each case of clauses (i) and (ii), would make the timely satisfaction of
any condition set forth in Section 6 or Section 7 impossible or unlikely or
that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Acquired Corporations. No notification given to Parent pursuant
to this Section 5.7(c) shall limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations of the Company
contained in this Agreement.   (d) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company in writing of (i) any event, condition,
fact or circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this
Agreement and that would cause or constitute a material inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made by Parent in this Agreement if such
representation or warranty had been made as of the time of the occurrence,
existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, or
such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed
on or prior to the date of this Agreement; and (ii) any material breach of
any covenant or obligation of Parent that, in each case of clauses (i) and
(ii), would make the timely satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Section 6 or Section 7 impossible or unlikely or that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
No notification given to the Company pursuant to this Section 5.7(d) shall
limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants
or obligations of Parent contained in this Agreement.   (e) During the Pre-
Closing Period, Parent shall not (without the prior written consent of the

delayed):   (i) declare, accrue, set aside or pay any extraordinary
dividends or make any other extraordinary distribution in respect of any
shares of Parent Common Stock;   (ii) amend or permit the adoption of any
amendment to its certificate of incorporation (other than an amendment to

the stockholders of the Company;   (iii) commence or consummate any merger
(other than the Merger), share exchange, exchange offer or other business
combination or series of mergers, share exchanges, exchange offers, which in
the aggregate (i) would result in the issuance of more than 25,000,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock, or (ii) which would reasonably be expected to delay
the consummation of the Merger;   (iv) take or agree to take any action
which would result in the failure to satisfy the condition provided for in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.2; or   (v) agree or commit to take any of the
actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iii)" of this Section
5.7(e).   A-26    5.8 Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult
