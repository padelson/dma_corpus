"Business");

     WHEREAS, Debtors are debtors and debtors-in-possession under Chapter
11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. ss.ss. 101-1330 (as
amended, the "Bankruptcy Code"), having each commenced voluntary cases
(Case No. 01-11200 et al., Jointly Administered) on November 13, 2001 (the
"Petition Date") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and

                                 Article I

                                DEFINITIONS

Section 1.1   Defined Terms.
              -------------

     For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

     "Adjustment Amount" shall initially be zero. The Adjustment Amount
shall be increased to the extent that the dollar amount (if positive) of
Permitted Cash Distributions from March 31, 2003 to the Closing Date from
the Acquired Subsidiaries (and the subsidiaries of the Acquired
Subsidiaries) to Debtors, net of Permitted Cash Investments by Debtors
during such period in the Acquired Subsidiaries (and the subsidiaries of
the Acquired Subsidiaries) from March 31, 2003 to the Closing Date, exceeds
the net amount projected therefor during such period in the projected
Weekly Cash Flows attached as Exhibit I hereto and set forth in paragraphs
B4, B5 and B6 of the Agreed Upon Procedures, and the Adjustment Amount
shall be reduced to the extent that the dollar amount (if positive) of
Permitted Cash Investments by Debtors in the Acquired Subsidiaries (and the
subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries) from March 31, 2003 to the
Closing Date, net of Permitted Cash Distributions to Debtors during such
period by the Acquired Subsidiaries (and the subsidiaries of the Acquired
Subsidiaries), exceeds the net amount projected therefor during such period
in the Weekly Cash Flows as set forth in paragraphs B4, B5 and B6 of the
Agreed Upon Procedures. The Adjusted Amount shall be increased to the
extent that the dollar amount of Extraordinary Cash Distributions from
March 31, 2003 to the Closing Date exceeds the dollar amount of
Extraordinary Cash Investments from March 31, 2003 to the Closing Date, and
shall be decreased to the extent that the dollar amount of the
Extraordinary Cash Investments from March 31, 2003 to the Closing Date
exceeds the dollar amount of Extraordinary Cash Distributions from March
31, 2003 to the Closing Date. The Adjustment Amount shall be decreased to
the extent up to U.S. $2,500,000 (actual amount to be determined by actual
cash paid and the current exchange rate) is paid from Republic Industries
Automotive Group (Switzerland) AG to National Car Rental Canada Inc. The
Adjusted Amount shall be increased to the extent that, as of the close of
any monthly measurement period, any payable (including any payable
determined in a manner consistent with the Debtors' current methodology
pursuant to and reflected in the line item "Fleet Financing and Lease
Payments") then existing by any Debtor to any Acquired Subsidiary (or any
subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary) that was projected to be paid in the
Weekly Cash Flow on or prior to the close of such measurement period, has
not been paid, and the Adjusted Amount shall be decreased to the extent
that, as of the close of any monthly measurement period, any receivable
(including any receivable determined in a manner consistent with the
Debtors' current methodology pursuant to and reflected in the line item
"Fleet Financing and Lease Payments") then existing of any Debtor from any
Acquired Subsidiary (or any subsidiary of any Acquired Subsidiary) that was
projected to be paid in the Weekly Cash Flow on or prior to the close of
such measurement period, has not been paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
that no adjustment shall be made to the Adjustment Amount pursuant to this
definition to the extent such adjustment is duplicative of an adjustment
otherwise made pursuant to this definition.

     "Affiliate" of any Person shall mean any Person that controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with such Person. As used herein,
the term "control" (including the terms "controlling," "controlled by" and
"under common control with") means the possession, directly or indirectly,
of the power to direct or to cause the direction of the management and
policies of a Person, whether through ownership of voting securities or
other interests, by contract or otherwise.

     "Agreed Upon Procedures Definitions" shall mean, collectively, the
following defined terms: ALM Business, Bankruptcy-Related Professional
Fees, Baseline Working Capital, Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Target

including the Key Employee Retention Plan, the 401(k) Plan, the Company
Health and Welfare Plan, the New Severance Plan and all Liabilities of any
Debtor under FAMPACT.

          The listing of any specific item or matter as an Excluded
Liability shall in no respect (i) limit the generality of the first
sentence of this Section 2.4 or (ii) create any implication that any item
or matter not so listed is an Assumed Liability.

          Section 2.5 Purchase Price. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, in consideration of the sale, transfer, assignment,
conveyance and delivery by Debtors of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser or
its designated Affiliates, Purchaser or its designated Affiliates shall,
and CCM shall cause Purchaser or Purchaser's designated Affiliates to, (x)
pay to Debtors, at the Closing, an amount equal to $230,000,000 less the
aggregate amount of the letters of credit outstanding under the Congress
Financial facility that are not fully cash collateralized as of the date
hereof, as further adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.5 (as adjusted, the
"Purchase Price"), and (y) assume the Assumed Liabilities. The Purchase
Price payable pursuant to clause (x) above shall be paid by Purchaser to
Seller on behalf of Debtors at Closing (A) by delivery to Seller of the
Deposit and any interest accrued thereon in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, (B) by delivery of the Indemnity Escrow Amount to the escrow
agent for the Indemnity Escrow Amount as set forth in Section 2.5(h) and
(C) the balance (i.e. the difference between the Purchase Price and
payments under clause (A) and (B) herein, as adjusted by Section 2.5(b)) by
wire transfer of immediately available same day funds, in each case to an
account or accounts designated by Seller at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. The amount paid by Purchaser to Seller on the
Closing Date (which shall be deemed to include the Escrow Indemnity Amount)
pursuant to this Section 2.5(a) is referred to as the "Closing Date
Amount".

          (b) The amount of cash to be delivered to Seller by Purchaser at
Closing shall be: (i) if the Estimated Cure Costs are greater than the Cure
Costs Threshold, reduced by such excess and (ii)(A) if the Estimated
Closing Working Capital is less than the Target Amount for the month end at
which the Closing occurs, reduced by such shortfall or (B) if the Estimated
Closing Working Capital is greater than the Target Amount for the month end
at which the Closing occurs, increased by such excess and provided that an
adjustment shall be made pursuant to clause (ii) in favor of Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, only to the extent that the aggregate of
such adjustments exceeds the Deductible Amount. In addition, in the event
that the amount of cash to be delivered to Seller at Closing is reduced
pursuant to clause (ii)(A) of this Section 2.5(b), and the preliminary
estimated closing working capital calculated by Seller pursuant to Section
2.5(d)(i) is greater than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, Purchaser
shall deposit an amount equal to such excess in an escrow account pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement as defined in Section 2.7; provided,
that the amount of the escrow deposit shall in no event exceed the
difference between (i) $230,000,000 and (ii) the sum of (A) the cash paid
by Purchaser to Seller at Closing, (B) the aggregate amount of letters of
credit outstanding under the Congress Financial facility that are not fully
cash collateralized on the date hereof and (C) the Estimated Cure Costs in
excess of the Cure Cost Threshold. The amount so deposited into escrow on
the Closing Date shall be referred to as the "Closing Escrow Deposit".

          (c) (i) Promptly following the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order, Seller shall deliver a copy of the Baseline Working Capital
Statement, the Target Working Capital Statements, the Weekly Cash Flows and
the Agreed Upon Procedures to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unwilling or
unable to perform, such other accounting firm as Seller, Lehman and
Purchaser shall jointly select (KPMG or such other accounting firm, the
"Accountants"), which shall be retained by Purchaser and Seller to promptly
conduct a review, in accordance with the Agreed Upon Procedures set forth
on Exhibit K, as may be modified in good faith by agreement of Purchaser,
Seller and Lehman after discussions with the Accountants (the "Agreed Upon
Procedures"), of the Baseline Working Capital Statement and the Target
Working Capital Statement to determine, in addition to the matters
specified in the Agreed Upon Procedures, whether (i) the adjustments to the
March 31, 2003 balance sheets of the Debtors, furnished to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 3.5(a) and reflected in the Baseline Working Capital
Statement, and (ii) the adjustments made to the Target Working Capital
Statements to determine the Target Amount, were made in a manner consistent
with the Agreed Upon Procedures and the definitions of Current Assets,
Current Liabilities, ALM Business, Target Amount and Securitization
Subsidiaries set forth herein. The fees and expenses of the Accountants
shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller (to the extent Seller
does not pay all or any of its portion of such fees and expenses, Lehman
shall pay such fees and expenses and shall be entitled to promptly recover
such amount from Seller as an immediately payable administrative claim).
The Accountants shall be instructed to issue a preliminary report to
Purchaser, Seller and Lehman, which shall set forth in reasonable detail
whether the Baseline Working Capital Statement and the adjustments to the
Target Working Capital Statements were prepared in a manner consistent with
Agreed Upon Procedures and such definitions within 15 days of their
retention, setting forth the nature of any inconsistency. The performance
of the Agreed Upon Procedures will not result in any adjustment to the
dollar values reflected in the unaudited financial statements of the
Debtors at March 31, 2003 or, other than to correct any inconsistency with
the methodology required by the Agreed Upon Procedures and the definitions
herein, in the Target Working Capital Statements. Each of Purchaser, Seller
and Lehman may, within five Business Days of the delivery of the
preliminary report (the "Comment Period"), deliver to the Accountants in
writing its views as to why it believes the preliminary report is not
correct (and if it shall do so, then it shall furnish a copy thereof to
each of Purchaser, Seller and Lehman) (an "Objection Notice"). Each party
shall have the right, within two Business Days following the expiration of
the Comment Period, to deliver to the Accountants (with a copy to each
other party, as above) its comments on any Objection Notice delivered by
any other party. Within five Business Days following the expiration of the
Comment Period, the Accountants shall deliver to Purchaser, Seller and
Lehman its final report (the "Agreed Upon Procedures Report") as to the
consistency of (x) the adjustments to the March 31, 2003 balance sheets of
Sellers furnished to Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.5(a) and reflected in
the Baseline Working Capital Statement and (y) the adjustments made to the
Target Working Capital Statements, were made in accordance with the Agreed
Upon Procedures and the definitions of Current Assets, Current Liabilities,
ALM Business, Target Amount and Securitization Subsidiaries. Such report
shall be final and binding upon the Purchaser, Debtors and Lehman. To the
extent that the Agreed Upon Procedures Report shall state that there is any
inconsistency, then the Seller shall issue a revised Baseline Working
Capital Statement and revised Target Working Capital Statements, which
shall be accompanied by a report of the Accountants that such Baseline
Working Capital Statement and adjustments to Target Working Capital
Statements are prepared in a manner consistent with the Agreed Upon
Procedures and the definitions of Current Assets, Current Liabilities, ALM
Business, Target Amount and Securitization Subsidiaries, which statements
shall be final and binding upon Purchaser, Debtors and Lehman, and such
revised Baseline Working Capital Statement and revised Target Working
Capital Statements shall be deemed the "Baseline Working Capital Statement"
and the "Target Working Capital Statements" attached to this Agreement as
Exhibits E and H, respectively.

               (ii) Seller shall furnish to Purchaser, Lehman and the
Accountants as promptly as practicable (and in any event on or prior to the
21st day of the succeeding month, except on or prior to June 30, 2003 with
respect to the April 2003 and May 2003 month-end reporting periods)
following the closing of each of its month-end reporting periods ending
after April 30, 2003 and prior to the Closing Date, detailed schedules (the
"Month End Working Capital Schedules") setting forth a computation of
Working Capital, Current Assets, Current Liabilities and Adjustment Amount
as of the end of such month, including (A) a comparison of each line item
included in Current Asset and Current Liabilities to the corresponding line
item in the Target Working Capital Statement for such month-end, (B) a
comparison of each line item included in Permitted Cash Distributions and
Permitted Cash Investments to the corresponding line item in the Weekly
Cash Flows for such period, (C) a schedule setting forth each Extraordinary
Cash Distribution and each Extraordinary Cash Investment and (D) a schedule
setting forth the computation of the Adjustment Amount. Promptly following
the receipt of the Month End Working Capital Schedule, the Accountants
shall conduct a review in accordance with the Agreed Upon Procedures, of
the Month End Working Capital Statement to determine whether Working
Capital, Current Assets, Current Liabilities and Adjustment Amount were
determined in a manner consistent with the Agreed Upon Procedures and the
definitions thereof set forth herein. The Accountants shall be instructed
to issue a preliminary report to Purchaser, Seller and Lehman, which shall
set forth in reasonable detail whether the Month End Working Capital
Statement and the components thereof were prepared in a manner consistent
with the Agreed Upon Procedures and such definitions within 10 days of the
delivery of the Month End Working Capital Statement, setting forth the
nature of any inconsistency.

          (d) (i) Not later than 3:00 p.m. on the 5th Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, Debtors shall prepare and deliver
to Purchaser the preliminary estimated closing working capital statement
and estimated cure costs statement, prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, together with a schedule to each statement setting forth in
reasonable detail the calculations of the estimated closing working capital
and estimated cure costs, respectively, supporting Debtors computations
thereof, and accompanied by a certificate of the chief accounting officer
of Seller as to the accuracy of such estimated closing working capital
statement and estimated cure costs statement.

               (ii) Not later than 9:00 a.m. on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver
to Seller and Lehman the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement and
the Estimated Cure Costs Statement, prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, together with a schedule to each statement setting forth in
reasonable detail the calculations of Estimated Closing Working Capital and
the Estimated Cure Costs, respectively, supporting Purchaser's computations
thereof, and accompanied by a certificate of a senior officer of Purchaser
as to the accuracy of such Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement and
Estimated Cure Costs Statement.

          (e) (i) Within 75 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller and Lehman a Closing Working Capital Statement and
Cure Costs Statement, prepared in accordance with this Agreement, together
with a schedule to each statement setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculations of Closing Working Capital and Cure Costs respectively,
supporting Purchaser's computations thereof, and accompanied by a
certificate of a senior officer of Purchaser as to the accuracy of such
Closing Working Capital Statement and Cure Costs Statement. Such Closing
Working Capital Statement, at Purchaser's election, may or may not be
accompanied by a report of an independent public accounting firm thereon;
provided that such report may not be issued by the Accountants unless
Seller and Lehman shall have previously consented to their retention by
Purchaser.

               (ii) Promptly following receipt of the Closing Working
Capital Statement and the Cure Costs Statement, Seller and Lehman shall
review the same and, within 30 days after such receipt (the "Dispute Notice
Period"), Seller and Lehman may deliver to Purchaser a notice (a "Dispute
Notice") in the event that Seller and Lehman determine in good faith that
the Closing Working Capital Statement misstates the Closing Working Capital
and/or the Cure Costs Statement misstates the Cure Costs. If either Seller
or Lehman fail to deliver a Dispute Notice within the Dispute Notice
Period, Seller and Lehman will be deemed to have irrevocably waived its
right to deliver a Dispute Notice. Any Dispute Notice must specify in
reasonable detail those items or amounts as to which Seller or Lehman
disagree and the basis for their disagreement. Seller and Lehman will be
deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Closing Working Capital Statement and the Cure Costs Statement, as
applicable, to which no specific objection has been made or no specific
basis for an objection has been given. If Seller or Lehman delivers a
Dispute Notice within the Dispute Notice Period, Seller, Lehman and
Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to agree upon the Closing Working
Capital and the Cure Costs. If Seller, Lehman and Purchaser fail to agree
to such matters within 30 calendar days (the "Negotiation Period") after
the Dispute Notice is delivered to Purchaser, matters described in the
Dispute Notice will be resolved by submission no later than five Business
Days following the expiration of the Negotiation Period to the Accountants
for determination of Closing Working Capital and/or Cure Costs within 45
calendar days after the items in dispute are submitted to the Accountants.
If items in dispute are submitted to the Accountants for resolution, (x)
each party will furnish to the Accountants (and to the other party) such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed
issues as the Accountants may request and are available to that party (or
its independent public accountants), and will be afforded the opportunity
to present to the Accountants any material relating to the determination
and to discuss the determination with the Accountants; (y) the
determination by the Accountants, as set forth in a notice delivered to
Debtors, Lehman and Purchaser by the Accountants will be binding and
conclusive on Debtors, Lehman and Purchaser; and (z) Debtors, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other, will each bear 50% of the fees of the
Accountants for such determination.

               (iii) The date on which the Closing Working Capital
Statement and the Cure Costs Statement are accepted or finally determined
in accordance with this Section 2.5(e) is referred to as the "Determination
Date". The Closing Working Capital Statement as accepted or finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.5(e) is referred to as the
"Final Closing Working Capital Statement" and the Cure Costs Statement as
accepted or finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.5(e) is
referred to as the "Final Cure Costs Statement". On the fifth Business Day
following the Determination Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
statement (the "Determination Date Statement") setting forth the final
computation of the cash portion of Purchase Price as follows: (1)
$230,000,000 less the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding
under the Congress Financial facility that are not fully cash
collateralized as of the date hereof, minus (2) the excess, if any, of Cure
Costs over the Cure Cost Threshold, plus (3), if Closing Working Capital is
greater than the Target Amount, an amount equal to such excess, minus (4),
if Closing Working Capital is less the Target Amount, an amount equal to
such shortfall; provided that the amount determined pursuant to clause (3)
or (4) shall be reduced by the Deductible Amount. The cash portion of the
Purchase Price as computed pursuant to the preceding sentence is referred
to herein as the "Determination Date Amount". On the Business Day
immediately following the delivery of the Determination Date Statement, the
following payment shall be made to an account specified by the recipient
prior to such date:

                    (A) If the Determination Date Amount exceeds the
Closing Date Amount, Purchaser shall, and CCM shall cause Purchaser to, pay
to Debtors, out of the Closing Escrow Deposit and, with respect to any
remaining balance, from other funds an amount in immediately available same
day funds equal to such excess, together with interest on such amount at an
annual rate equal to the Prime Rate calculated on a 365-day year (the
"Interest Rate") from the Closing Date to the date of the payment of such
amount to Debtors; or

                    (B) If the Closing Date Amount exceeds the
Determination Date Amount, Debtors shall pay Purchaser, out of the Closing
Escrow Deposit and, with respect to any remaining balance, from other funds
an amount in immediately available same day funds equal to such excess,
together with interest on such amount at the Interest Rate from the Closing
Date to the date of the payment of such amount to Purchaser.

          (f) (i) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Aon
Risk Services ("Aon") the Month End Working Capital Statement as of the
month-end of the month prior to the Closing Date (the "Estimate Date"),
prepared in accordance with the Agreed Upon Procedures, and shall cause Aon
to prepare an actuarial report (the "Aon Estimated Report") regarding the
adequacy, as at the Estimate Date, of the Debtors' accruals in such
financial statements in respect of auto liability self-insurance exposures
for the Business and the ALM Business (other than Large Auto Liability
Claims), in a manner consistent with the preparation of the report which
Aon delivered to Seller on or about March 31, 2003 regarding the adequacy
of such accruals as at February 28, 2003 (the "Aon March Report")
(provided, however, that Aon shall be instructed to (i) take into account,
in preparing the Aon Estimated Report, the reserves of IAG in respect of
such self-insurance exposures and (ii) to take into account the effects of
bankruptcy on the terms of settlements and adequacy of accruals to the same
extent it did so in preparing the Aon March Report). Such Aon Estimated
Report shall set forth the range of such accruals that Aon believes to be
appropriate as of the Estimate Date. The Aon Estimated Report shall be
furnished to Seller, Purchaser and Lehman. In addition, not less than the
5th Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser and Lehman a schedule setting forth the accrual
required in respect of auto liability self-insurance exposures for the
Business and the ALM Business that involve claims of $1 million or more
("Large Auto Liability Claims") (such accrual shall be determined in a
manner consistent with past practice and shall take into account the
effects of bankruptcy on the terms of settlement and adequacy of accruals
to the same extent as Seller did so in establishing accruals for Large Auto
Liability Claims at March 31, 2003) (the "Management Accrual Amount").

               (ii) To the extent that the accruals in respect of auto
liability self-insurance exposures as of March 31, 2003 included in the
Baseline Working Capital Statement differs from the sum of (A) the
mid-point of the range of accruals proposed by the Aon March Report and (B)
the accruals established as of March 31, 2003 in respect of Large Auto
Liability Claims (the "March Management Accrual Amount"), the amount of
such difference shall be referred to as the "Differential."

               (iii) For purposes of calculating Current Liabilities in the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement, the amount of accruals in
respect of auto liability self-insurance exposures shall be the sum of (A)
the mid point of the range of accruals proposed by the Aon Estimated Report
and (B) the March Management Accrual Amount; provided, however, that, if
the accruals as at March 31 (as reflected in the Baseline Working Capital
Statement) exceeded the sum of (A) the mid-point of the range proposed by
the Aon March Report and (B) the March Management Accrual Amount, the
amount of such accruals in the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement
shall be decreased by the Differential or, if the accruals as at March 31
(as reflected in the Baseline Working Capital Statement) were less than the
sum of (A) mid-point of the range proposed by the Aon March Report and (B)
the March Management Accrual Amount, the amount of such accruals in the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement shall be increased by the
Differential.

               (iv) Promptly following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
cause Aon to prepare an actuarial report (the "Aon Closing Report")
regarding the adequacy, as at the Closing Date, of the Debtors' accruals
that are reflected on the Closing Working Capital Statement in respect of
auto liability self-insurance exposures for the Business and the ALM
Business (other than Large Auto Liability Claims), in a manner consistent
with the preparation of the Aon March Report (provided, however, that Aon
shall be instructed to take into account, in preparing the Aon Closing
Report, the reserves of IAG in respect of such self-insurance exposures).
Such Aon Closing Report shall set forth the range of such accruals that Aon
believes to be appropriate as of the Closing Date. The Aon Closing Report
shall be furnished to Purchaser and Lehman. In addition, promptly following
the Closing Date Purchaser shall deliver to Seller and Lehman a schedule
setting forth the accrual required in respect of Large Auto Liability
Claims (such accrual shall be determined in a manner consistent with past
practice and shall take into account the effects of bankruptcy and the
terms of settlement and adequacy of accruals to the same extent as Seller
did so in establishing the March Management Accrual Amount (the "Closing
Management Accrual Amount").

               (v) For purposes of calculating Current Liabilities in the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement, the amount of accruals in respect
of auto liability self-insurance exposures shall be the sum of (A) the
mid-point of the range of accruals proposed by the Aon Closing Report and
(B) the Closing Management Accrual Amount; provided, however, that, if the
accruals as at March 31 (as reflected in the Baseline Working Capital
Statement) exceeded the sum of (A) the mid-point of the range proposed by
the Aon March Report and (B) the March Management Accrual Amount, the
amount of such accruals in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall
be decreased by the Differential or, if the accruals as at March 31 (as
reflected in the Baseline Working Capital Statement) were less than the sum
of (A) the mid-point of the range proposed by the Aon March Report and (B)
the March Management Accrual Amount, the amount of such accruals in the
Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be increased by the
Differential.

          (g) The Seller (and after the Closing, Purchaser)shall fully
cooperate with Purchaser, Lehman, their respective representatives, the
Accountants, Aon (and after the Closing, Seller) and shall provide
Purchaser, Lehman, their respective representatives, the Accountants, Aon
(and after the Closing, Seller) with reasonable access, upon reasonable
prior notice, during normal business hours, to the assets, properties,
offices and other facilities, officers, employees, Commitments and books
and records of Seller and any Subsidiary, in connection with their review
of the Baseline Working Capital Statement, the Target Working Capital
Statements, the Month End Working Capital Statements, the estimated
statements delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(d)(i) and (ii) and the
determination of appropriate self-insurance accruals.

          (h) The Debtors, Purchaser and Lehman agree that the amount of
cash to be delivered to Seller by Purchaser at Closing shall be further
reduced by $6 million ("Indemnity Escrow Amount") which shall be governed
by an escrow agreement to be mutually agreed upon by Purchaser, Lehman and
Seller (the "Indemnity Escrow Agreement") unless the issues relating to the
state Tax liability set forth in the indemnity letter delivered to
Purchaser on the date hereof (the "Indemnity Letter") are resolved prior to
the Closing Date (it being understood that an agreement on apportionment by
the applicable state authority and the payment of the state Tax liability
to the jurisdiction set forth in the Indemnity Letter shall be deemed to be
a full and complete resolution of the issue giving rise to the escrow
arrangement). The scope of the indemnification and the material terms of
the escrow arrangement are set forth in the Indemnity Letter. Lehman shall
have the option, at any time during the term of the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, to substitute an indemnification agreement (based on the same
terms set forth in the Indemnity Letter) between Purchaser and Lehman for
the remaining term of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement at which time all
monies held pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement shall be released.

     Section 2.6 Purchase Price Allocation. Purchaser and Debtors agree
that the Purchase Price and other relevant items will be allocated to the
Acquired Assets for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and the corresponding
provisions, if any, of applicable non-U.S., state and local Tax Law). As
promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (or before the Closing Date
with respect to certain assets, if required by applicable Tax Law),
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a statement that allocates the Purchase
Price and other relevant items in accordance with this Section 2.6 (the
"Allocation Statement"). An independent, nationally recognized valuation
firm selected by Purchaser in its discretion shall be instructed to prepare
or review the Allocation Statement, as appropriate; provided, however, that
Seller will have the right to raise reasonable objections to the valuation
firm selected by Purchaser in a written notice delivered to Purchaser no
later than five (5) calendar days after Seller receives notice of such
selection. Seller shall pay any incremental costs associated with
Purchaser's selection of a different valuation firm if Seller objects as
described in this Section 2.6. The Allocation Statement shall be adjusted
in a manner consistent with this Section 2.6 to reflect any adjustments to
the Purchase Price. Purchaser and Debtors shall file all Tax Returns
(including amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports
in a manner consistent with the Allocation Statement and shall not take any
position in any Tax proceeding that is inconsistent with the Allocation
Statement.

     Section 2.7 Deposit. Upon the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order,
Purchaser shall, and CCM shall cause Purchaser to, promptly, but in any
event within one Business Day of such date, deposit into escrow with JP
Morgan Chase Bank (the "Escrow Holder") an amount equal to $11,500,000 (the
"Deposit") in immediately available funds, to be held and disbursed
pursuant to the escrow agreement among Debtors, CCM Purchaser and the
Escrow Holder (the "Escrow Agreement") in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit D. Such Escrow Agreement shall include the provisions set forth in
this Section 2.7, including any provisions incorporated by reference
herein. Upon receipt of the Deposit, the Escrow Holder shall immediately
deposit the Deposit into an interest-bearing account. The Deposit shall
only become nonrefundable upon the earlier of (x) the Closing Date, (y) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(iii)(A) or (z) the
last day of the month that all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2
(with such date replacing the term "Closing" or "Closing Date" in Section
6.2) have been satisfied or waived and Purchaser fails to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an event specified in clause
(y) or (z), an "Escrow Release Event"). In the event the Deposit becomes
non-refundable by reason of a Escrow Release Event, the Escrow Holder shall
deliver the Deposit to Debtors in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.
Such payment shall not limit Seller's rights to pursue any claims against
Purchaser or CCM for a breach of this Agreement. At the Closing, the
Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) shall be credited toward payment
of the Purchase Price. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other
than an Escrow Release Event, the Escrow Holder shall return to Purchaser
the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement The Escrow Holder's escrow fees and charges shall be paid
by Purchaser.

     Section 2.8 The Closing. The closing of the purchase and sale of the
Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities hereunder and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York
10022, at a date (the "Closing Date") and time to be mutually agreed by
Debtors and Purchaser, which shall be (unless the parties otherwise agree)
the last Business Day of the month in which all of the conditions set forth
in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the
party entitled hereunder to waive any such condition of those conditions at
the Closing).

in or would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 3.2 Due Authorization; Enforceability. Assuming the entry of

giving of notice or lapse of time or the occurrence of any other condition,
event or circumstance) under any such Permit in any material respect.

of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code except as would not result in or would
not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.

          (f) The Benefit Plans and their related trusts that are intended
to qualify under Sections 401 and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, have
been determined by the IRS to qualify under such Sections and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, nothing has occurred since the time of such favorable
determination to cause the loss of such qualified status.

          (g) To the Knowledge of Seller, all contributions required to
have been made under any Benefit Plan or any Law to any trusts established

their terms and applicable Laws, including but not limited to the timely
filing of applicable reports, documents and notices with the Department of
Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty

individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. There has
been no "prohibited transaction" (including without limitation as a result
of any of the transactions contemplated hereby) within the meaning of
Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA involving the assets of

the disqualification of any Benefit Plan under applicable Law, or the

the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Body.

          (j) Except (i) as disclosed in Schedule 3.13(j) hereto or (ii)
claims for benefits under the claims procedures of any Benefit Plans, there
are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing,
actions, claims or proceedings against Seller or Subsidiary or any Benefit

          (k) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.13(k) hereto, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder will (i) increase any benefits under
any Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan or (ii) result in the acceleration of the

disclosed and described in Schedule 3.13(k) hereto, no Benefit Plan or
agreement, program, policy or other arrangement by or to which Seller or
any Subsidiary is a party, is bound or is otherwise liable, by its terms or

property or other consideration on account of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to

disability or death benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to their
respective current or former employees beyond their retirement or other

Title I of ERISA and is at the expense of the participant or beneficiary.

respects in accordance with its terms and with the requirements of
applicable Law. All material contributions required to be made under the

timely made on or prior to the Closing Date. Neither Seller nor any
Subsidiary has incurred any obligations in connection with the termination
of or withdrawal from any Foreign Pension Plan except as required by
operation of applicable Law and set forth on Schedule 3.13(n) hereto, and

applicable Law. With respect to any funded Foreign Pension Plan, the plan
has been funded in accordance with applicable Law and the terms of such
plans. There are no pending or, to Knowledge of Seller, threatened actions
which have been asserted in writing or instituted (other than in respect of
benefits due in the ordinary course which, in the aggregate are not
material) against the assets of any of the Foreign Plans or against Seller
or any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate or any fiduciary of the Foreign
Plans with respect to the Foreign Plans.

no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, material labor disputes or
grievances, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threats thereof, by or with

compensation for any services performed by them, or for amounts required to
be reimbursed to their current employees or former employees.

          (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(e) and except for any
events that may be caused by the Purchaser's decision not to hire certain
employees of Debtors employed in the Business, there has been no event that
has caused or required the Seller or its Subsidiaries to issue the
applicable notices under the WARN Act or other similar Law requiring
advance notification for the termination of employees, and in the event
that such an event has occurred, such event would not result in Liabilities
under the WARN Act or any other similar Law requiring advance notification
for the termination of employees.

Effect.

          (c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15(c), to the Knowledge of

case, except for such Environmental Claims as would not result in or would
not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15(d), to the Knowledge of
Seller, no Environmental Claims have been asserted against any facilities
that may have received Hazardous Materials generated by Seller or any
Subsidiary or any predecessor in interest nor has there been a release at

          (e) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15(e), there has been no
Release at any of the properties owned or operated by Seller or any
Subsidiary or a predecessor in interest, which is reasonably likely to

maintain in subsistence all Seller Owned Intellectual Property that is
Registered, and has diligently pursued all applications for registration
forming part of the Seller Owned Intellectual Property that is Registered,

made for any Acquired Subsidiary or any direct or indirect subsidiary of an

such notification shall affect or cure a breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

challenging the transactions provided for in this Agreement as violative of
any Antitrust Law, each of Seller, the Subsidiaries and Purchaser shall
cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts vigorously to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed,

     Section 5.7 Submission for Bankruptcy Court Approval. On May 30, 2003,
Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court, a motion seeking the approval of
this Section 5.7 and authorizing the observance and performance of such
terms by Debtors and Purchaser and seeking approval of the Sale Approval
Order.

          (a) Debtors acknowledge that this Agreement is the culmination of
an extensive process undertaken by Debtors to identify and negotiate a
transaction with a bidder who was prepared to pay the highest and best
purchase price for the Acquired Assets while assuming or otherwise
satisfying the Assumed Liabilities in order to maximize the value of those
assets. Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "Bidding
Procedures") to be employed with respect to this Agreement concerning the
sale of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser (the "Sale"); provided, that
Purchaser reserves the right to further comment on the form of the order of
the Bankruptcy Court approving the Bidding Procedures (the "Bidding
Procedures Order"). The Bidding Procedures may be as amended, modified or
supplemented with the consent of the Purchaser.

          (b) The Sale is subject to competitive bidding only as set forth
herein and approval by the Bankruptcy Court at a hearing under Sections
105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Sale Hearing"). The following
overbid provisions and related bid protections are designed to reimburse
Purchaser for its efforts and agreements to date and to facilitate a full
and fair process designed to maximize the value of the Acquired Assets for
the benefit of Debtors' creditors and stakeholders.

          (c) Bid Deadline. All Bids (as defined below) must be submitted
to Debtors c/o Lazard Freres & Co., LLC, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York,
New York, 10020, Attention: Perk Hixon so as to be received not later than
11:00 a.m., eastern time on the date which is three Business Days prior to
the date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing (the "Bid
Deadline"). Debtors will immediately distribute by facsimile transmission,
personal delivery or reliable overnight courier service in accordance with
Section 8.1, a copy of each Bid upon receipt to counsel to Purchaser. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Bid" shall mean one or more letters from one
or more Persons whom the respective Board of Directors of Debtors have
determined in the exercise of their fiduciary duty are financially able to
consummate the purchase of the Acquired Assets (a "Qualified Bidder")
stating that (i) such Qualified Bidder offers to purchase all or a portion
of the Acquired Assets upon the terms and conditions set forth in a copy of
this Agreement, together with all Exhibits and Schedules hereto (the
"Definitive Sale Documentation"), marked to show those amendments and
modifications to the Definitive Sale Documentation, including, but not
limited to, price and the time of closing, that such Qualified Bidder
proposes, (ii) such Qualified Bidder is prepared to enter into and
consummate the transaction not later than December 31, 2003, and (iii) each
such Qualified Bidder's offer is binding until the closing of a purchase of
the Acquired Assets.

          (d) Qualified Bid. Only Qualified Bids will qualify for
consideration at the Auction (as defined below). For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Qualified Bid" is a Bid that:

               (i) complies in all respects with this Section 5.7;

               (ii) is a proposal which Debtors determine, in the good
faith opinion of their respective Boards of Directors or managers, as the
case may be, after consultation with the independent financial advisor of
Debtors, is not materially more burdensome or conditional than the terms of
this Agreement and has a value greater than or equal to the sum of (x) the
value, as reasonably determined by the independent financial advisor of
Debtors, of Purchaser's offer plus (y) the amount of the Termination Fee
plus (z) in the case of the initial Qualified Bid and in the case of any
subsequent Qualified Bids, one half of one percent (1/2%), over the
preceding Qualified Bid;

               (iii) is substantially on the same or better terms and
conditions as those set forth in a copy of the Definitive Sale
Documentation;

               (iv) is accompanied by satisfactory evidence of committed
financing or other ability to perform; and

               (v) is accompanied by a deposit (by means of a certified
bank check from a U.S. bank or by wire transfer) equal to or greater than
the Termination Fee.

          (e) If Debtors do not receive any Qualified Bids, Debtors will
report the same to the Bankruptcy Court and will proceed with a sale and
assignment of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. This Agreement executed by Purchaser shall constitute a
Qualified Bid for all purposes.

          (f) Auction, Bidding Increments, and Bids Remaining Open.

               (i) If Debtors receive a Qualified Bid, Debtors will conduct
an auction (the "Auction") at the offices of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver
& Jacobson, on the date that is one Business Day prior to the date
scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing, beginning at 11:00
a.m. (EDT) or such later time or other place as Debtors shall notify all
Qualified Bidders who have submitted Qualified Bids. Only Purchaser,
Debtors, Representatives of Lazard, Representatives of Lehman, Liberty,
MBIA, any representative of the creditors' committee appointed in the
Bankruptcy Case and any Qualified Bidders who have timely submitted
Qualified Bids shall be entitled to attend the Auction, and only Purchaser
and Qualified Bidders will be entitled to make any subsequent Qualified
Bids at the Auction. Bidding at the Auction will continue until such time
as the highest and best Qualified Bid is determined. Debtors may announce
at the Auction additional procedural rules that are reasonable under the
circumstances (e.g., the amount of time allotted to make subsequent
overbids) for conducting the Auction so long as such rules are not
inconsistent with these Bidding Procedures.

               (ii) At least one Business Day prior to the Auction, Debtors
will give Purchaser and all other Qualified Bidders a copy of the highest
and best Qualified Bid received and copies of all other Qualified Bids. In
addition, Debtors will inform Purchaser and each Qualified Bidder who has
expressed its intent to participate in the Auction the identity of all
Qualified Bidders that may participate in the Auction.

          (g) Termination Fee. In the event that Debtors (i) accept a Bid,
other than that of Purchaser, as the highest and best offer, (ii) sell,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose directly or indirectly, including
through an asset sale, stock sale, merger, reorganization or other similar
transaction (by any Debtor or otherwise), all or substantially all or a
material portion of the Acquired Assets (or agree to do any of the
foregoing) in a transaction or series of transactions to a party or parties
other than Purchaser within one year from the date hereof, or (iii) choose
not to sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, directly or
indirectly, including through an asset sale, stock sale, merger,
reorganization or other similar transaction (by any Debtor or otherwise),
all or substantially all or a material portion of the Acquired Assets (or
agree to do any of the foregoing) to Purchaser whether as a result of the
proposal of a stand-alone plan of reorganization or otherwise (either of
clause (i), (ii) or (iii), an "Alternative Transaction"), Debtors shall pay
to Purchaser an amount equal to: (x) $12,500,000, plus (y) its reasonable,
actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
expenses of counsel, expenses of financial advisor and expenses of other
consultants and the HSR Act filing fee or other fees paid in connection
with any notices or fillings made pursuant to Antitrust Laws) incurred by
CCM and Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in excess of those expenses paid pursuant to the
Expense Reimbursement Order, not to exceed $1,500,000 (together, the
"Termination Fee"); provided, however, that in no event shall the
Termination Fee be payable to Purchaser (1) if Purchaser terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(vi), the proviso to Section
7.1(a)(viii)(3), Section 7.1(a)(ix) or Section 7.1(a)(x), (2) if this
Agreement is terminated by Debtors pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(iii)(A), (3)
if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(i) or (4) if on
the last day of the month that all of the conditions set forth in Section
6.2 (with such date replacing the terms "Closing" and "Closing Date" in
Section 6.2) have been satisfied or waived without the Closing having
occurred Purchaser fails to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Termination Fee shall be paid as an administrative
priority expense of Debtors under Section 503(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code
upon the termination of this Agreement.

     Section 5.8 Transfer Taxes. To the extent provided in the Sale
Approval Order, in accordance with Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code,
the instruments transferring the Acquired Assets to Purchaser shall contain
the following endorsement:

            "Because  this   [instrument]   has  been   authorized
            pursuant  to Order  of the  United  States  Bankruptcy
            Court  for the  District  of  Delaware  relating  to a
            chapter  11 plan of the  Grantor,  it is  exempt  from
            transfer taxes,  stamp taxes or similar taxes pursuant
            to 11 U.S.C. Section 1146(c)."

To the extent the foregoing endorsement is not applicable or effective,
Seller and Purchaser shall each pay 50% of any real property transfer or
gains Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, excise Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax
or, registration Tax, documentary Tax or other similar Tax incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes"). No later than 15 days prior to the date
any Tax return that must be filed by Seller (or the applicable Subsidiary)
in connection with Transfer Taxes required to be paid pursuant to this
Section 5.8 (such Tax returns, "Transfer Tax Returns") is due, Seller (or
the applicable Subsidiary) shall prepare, on a basis consistent with the
allocations determined in accordance with Section 2.6, all Transfer Tax
Returns and provide copies of such Transfer Tax Returns to Purchaser for
its review and consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Seller (or the applicable Subsidiary) shall file any such Transfer
Tax Return prepared pursuant to this Section 5.8 that is required to be
filed under applicable Law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Seller's
portion of such Transfer Taxes are not paid on or prior to the Closing,
Purchaser shall be entitled to escrow (on reasonable terms) from the
Purchase Price an amount sufficient to secure Seller's and the
Subsidiaries' obligations under this Section 5.8.

     Section 5.9 Employment.

          (a) Hiring of Employees. Purchaser shall offer employment as of
the Closing Date to at least 90% of the employees of Debtors who are
employed in the Business (whether salaried or hourly, union or non-union,
and full-time or part-time), whether or not actively employed on the
Closing Date (e.g., including employees on vacation and leave of absence,
including maternity, family, sick or short-term disability leave, and leave
under the Family Medical Leave Act) at substantially the same location
where such employee was employed immediately prior to the Closing Date on
at least the same compensation and levels of responsibility, and on such
other terms and conditions (including premium pay, shift differentials, and
benefit plan and incentive plan coverages but excluding any equity-based
compensation) that are in the aggregate not less favorable than those in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each such employee who
accepts Purchaser's offer of employment is hereinafter referred to as a
"Transferred Employee." Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not
be prohibited by this Section 5.9 from terminating the employment of any
Transferred Employee following the Closing Date. For avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Agreement shall create a contract of employment or alter
the at-will status of any employee of the Business.

          (b) Continuing Benefit Plans. Purchaser shall assume, honor and
continue to perform all obligations of any Debtor under any Benefit Plan
listed on Schedule 2.1(g) and will cause Acquired Subsidiaries to fund and
continue to perform obligations under any Foreign Plan, subject to the
terms of the plans.

          (c) Pursuant to Sections 3121(a), 3302(e) and 3306(b) of the
Code, for the period beginning January 1, 2003 and ending on the Closing
Date, Debtors shall transfer to Purchaser and Purchaser shall accept (as
successor to Debtors solely with respect to this Section 5.9(c)) with
respect to the employees, (i) the obligation of Debtors to file Forms W-2,
Wage and Tax Statement and (ii) credit for Social Security and Medicare
wage Taxes (FICA payments), federal unemployment Taxes (FUTA payments) and
applicable state unemployment Taxes.

          (d) Effective on or immediately after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cover Transferred Employees in one or more employee welfare benefit
plans which shall provide welfare benefits (including, but not limited to,
medical, dental, vision, prescription drug, disability and life benefits)
to the Transferred Employees and their dependents, which are substantially
comparable to the welfare benefits which were provided to such Transferred
Employees and their dependents by the plans covering them immediately prior
to the Closing Date, excluding any post-employment welfare benefits
including but not limited to, retiree medical or retiree life insurance
benefits and, medical, dental and vision benefits provided to disabled
former employees. Transferred Employees shall be entitled to participate in
such Purchaser welfare benefit plans by applying their service with Seller
and its Subsidiaries to any eligibility service period required under
Purchaser's plans. Transferred Employees shall receive credit under
Purchaser's plans for deductibles paid by them for the plan year coinciding
with the Closing Date current plan year while they were covered under
Seller's welfare benefit plans. Debtors (or their designees) shall provide
continuation coverage under COBRA to all "M& A Qualified Beneficiaries" for
so long as the Debtor or its Subsidiaries maintain a group health plan.
Thereafter, the Purchaser shall provide COBRA coverage in accordance with
applicable Law. During the period that Debtors (or their designee) or the
Purchaser provide continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA, Debtors (or
their designees) or the Purchaser shall charge persons who elect such
coverage the maximum premium permitted under COBRA.

          (e) Effective on or immediately after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall maintain a defined contribution plan for the benefit of
Transferred Employees (the "Purchaser Savings Plan") that is substantially
comparable to the defined contribution plan provided by the Seller. The
Purchaser Savings Plan shall provide the Transferred Employees with the
opportunity to defer compensation pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code
and the Purchaser shall make matching contributions to the Purchaser
Savings Plan, in each case, in such amounts as the ANC Rental Corporation
401(k) Plan provided immediately prior to the Closing Date. Transferred
Employees shall be entitled to participate in such Purchaser Savings Plan
by applying their service with Seller and its Subsidiaries to any
eligibility service period or vesting service period required under
Purchaser Savings Plan and the Purchaser Savings Plan will accept direct
rollover contributions, including loans from Transferred Employees, in
accordance with the terms of the Purchaser Savings Plan and applicable Law.

          (f) Transferred Employee and M & A Qualified Beneficiary
Information. Seller shall provide to Purchaser in a format reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser and as permitted under applicable Law, the
name, social security number and years of service, most recent job
position, seniority and most recent annual salary or wage rate of each
Transferred Employee and each M & A Qualified Beneficiary. Debtors shall
provide to Purchaser additional information with regard to employees,
former employees and retirees of Debtors as Purchaser may reasonably
request in connection with any obligation Purchaser may have to such
employees, former employees and retirees of the Debtors after the Closing
Date.

          (g) Bonus Programs.

               (i) On the first payroll date following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall pay each non-union Transferred Employee (other than a
general manager) below grade level 14 with a bonus equal to one week's
salary, and Seller shall pay to (and Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for)
each non-union employee of the Debtors below grade level 14 who is in good
standing and employed in the Business on the Closing Date who is not a
Transferred Employee with a bonus equal to one week's salary (whether or
not such person is employed by any Debtor on the date of payment.)

               (ii) The Purchaser shall establish a bonus pool (the "Bonus
Pool") all salaried employees of Debtors who are grade level 14 or higher
or who are general managers determined in accordance with Exhibit L. As
promptly as practicable following the determination of the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.5(e), the Purchaser shall determine the amount of the
bonus pool and shall pay to each Transferred Employee who, immediately
prior to the Closing was a salaried employee of grade level 14 or higher,
such Transferred Employee's allocated share of such Bonus Pool (as
determined below), and Seller shall pay (and Purchaser shall reimburse
Seller for) to each employee of the Debtors who is in good standing and
employed in the Business on the Closing Date who is not a Transferred
Employee with a bonus equal to such employee's allocated share of such
Bonus Pool (whether or not such person is employed by any Debtor or
Purchaser on the date of payment). The allocated share of the Bonus Pool of
any Transferred Employee or other employee eligible to receive a bonus
pursuant to this Section shall be equal to the base salary immediately
prior to the Closing of such Transferred Employee or other employee,
annualized, as a percentage of the aggregate base salary immediately prior
to the Closing Date of all of such Transferred Employees and other
employees eligible to receive the bonus annualized. All payments to
Transferred Employees and other employees pursuant to this Section 5.9(g)
shall be net of applicable withholding Taxes.

          (h) WARN. In the event that the termination of employees who are
not Transferred Employees under Section 5.9(a) results in an event that is
subject to the WARN Act, Purchaser shall reimburse the Debtors for the
payment of amounts due under the WARN Act in the event there is not
sufficient time to give the required notice of such terminations of
employees under the WARN Act; provided, however, that, subject to the
receipt of the necessary information from Purchaser, the Debtors, if the
Debtors are responsible for delivery of notice, have made all reasonable
efforts to comply with the delivery of notice to the affected employees and
the appropriate Governmental Bodies.

               (i) New Severance Plan. On the date of this Agreement, the
Seller shall adopt the New Severance Plan and such New Severance Plan shall
completely supersede and replace any severance provisions offered to
non-union employees and non-union former employees of the Debtors under any
Benefit Plan or under any other severance plan, program or agreement,
whether written or oral. The Debtors shall take appropriate action to
terminate any severance plan, program or agreement, whether written or
oral, applicable to non-union employees and non-union former employees of
the Debtors prior to the date of this Agreement; provided that, any
non-union former employee who became entitled to severance under the
Debtors' severance plan or program prior to the date of this Agreement,
shall continue to receive any owed payments of severance in accordance with
the terms of such severance plan or program. The Debtors shall not amend,
suspend or terminate the New Severance Plan, without the express written
consent of Purchaser, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Article VII hereby.

     Section 5.10 National and Alamo Names. From and after the Closing
Date, Seller and each Subsidiary (other than the Acquired Subsidiaries)
shall discontinue the use of Seller Intellectual Property in any manner
whatsoever; provided, however, that Seller and Subsidiaries may use Seller
Intellectual Property for purposes of filings required by applicable Law,
including, but not limited to, (i) filings with the SEC, (ii) with the
Bankruptcy Court or (iii) for a period not to exceed 60 days following the
Closing Date, in connection with effecting an orderly transition for such
period.

     Section 5.11 Transfers Not Effected as of Closing. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to require the conveyance, assignment or transfer of any
Acquired Asset that by its terms or by operation of applicable Law cannot
freely be conveyed, assigned, transferred or assumed. To the extent the
parties hereto have been unable to obtain any Third Party consents or
approvals required for the transfer of any Acquired Asset and to the extent
not otherwise prohibited by the terms of any Acquired Asset, to the extent
requested by Purchaser, Seller or the relevant Subsidiary shall continue to
be bound by the terms of such applicable Acquired Asset, and Purchaser
shall pay, perform and discharge fully all of the obligations of Seller or
the relevant Subsidiary, and Purchaser shall pay, perform and discharge
fully all of the obligations of Seller or the relevant Subsidiary under
such Acquired Asset from and after the Closing to the extent that the
corresponding benefit is received by Purchaser. Seller shall, and shall
cause the Subsidiaries to, without consideration therefor, pay, assign and
remit to Purchaser all monies, rights and other consideration received in
respect of such performance. Seller shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries
to, exercise or exploit their rights in respect of such Acquired Assets
only as reasonably directed by Purchaser and at Purchaser's expense. For so
long as Seller and the Subsidiaries continue to exist as legal entities
following the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall continue to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the earliest practicable
date, all such consents or approvals that have not been obtained at the
Closing Date but were required to be obtained. If and when any such
consents or approvals shall be obtained, Seller shall, or shall cause the
Subsidiaries to, promptly assign their rights and obligations thereunder to
Purchaser without payment of consideration and Purchaser shall, without
payment of any consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations.
The parties shall execute such good and sufficient instruments as may be
necessary to evidence such assignment and assumption.

     Section 5.12 Assigned Contracts; Negotiation of Cure Costs. Purchaser
shall notify Seller in writing no later than five Business Days prior to
the date scheduled for the Bankruptcy Court hearing on the Sale Approval
Order of all Commitments entered into prior to the Petition Date which have
not been assumed by any Debtor as of the date hereof (or after the date
hereof with the consent of Purchaser) that Purchaser does not intend to
assume. Purchaser may enter into agreements to settle Cure Costs with
respect to any Assigned Contract with the consent of Seller (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any such settlement agreement shall
become an Assigned Contract. Debtors and Purchaser shall cooperate with
each other in arranging and entering into such settlement agreements.
Purchaser shall negotiate Cure Costs in good faith with a view towards
mitigating Cure Costs, consistent with the ongoing requirements of the
Business.

     Section 5.13 Inter-Company Debt. At Closing, Debtors shall assign to
Purchaser the indebtedness then owed by the Acquired Subsidiaries (or the
direct or indirect subsidiaries thereof) to Debtors or one or more of their
Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Subsidiaries and the direct or indirect
subsidiaries thereof). At Closing, Purchaser shall assume any indebtedness
owed by Debtors or one or more of their Affiliates (excluding the Acquired
Subsidiaries and the direct or indirect subsidiaries thereof) to one or
more of the Acquired Subsidiaries (or the direct or indirect subsidiaries
thereof) that Purchaser elects to assume. Purchaser shall notify Seller, in
writing no later than five Business Days prior to the date scheduled for
the Bankruptcy Court hearing on the Sale Approval Order, of the
indebtedness that Purchaser intends to assume. Except as otherwise provided
in this Section 5.13, Seller and Subsidiaries shall satisfy or terminate
(by a contribution to capital or in such other manner as determined in
Sellers' and Subsidiaries' sole discretion), at no expense to the Acquired
Subsidiaries or Purchaser, all other Related Party Agreements (not
constituting Assigned Contracts) in existence at Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 3.17(o) or Section 5.15 regarding the
reduction of any Tax Asset, the parties acknowledge that the satisfaction
or termination of any indebtedness as provided in this Section 5.13 may
reduce the availability of net operating losses (as described in Section
3.17(o)) for the 2003 Year. This Section 5.13 shall not otherwise affect
the applicability of Section 5.15.

     Section 5.14 Vehicle Return Pursuant To Repurchase Programs;
Disposition Of Vehicles. Seller and each Subsidiary shall: (a) sell or
return each vehicle subject to a Repurchase Program (other than a vehicle
that has been the subject of theft, loss, casualty or destruction) to the
nearest related manufacturer official auction or other facility designated
by the relevant Vehicle Manufacturer or Affiliate thereof at the relevant
lessee's sole expense after the minimum term or mileage limit under such
Repurchase Program for such vehicle is achieved, but prior to the
expiration of the maximum term and/or prior to reaching the maximum mileage
limit under such Repurchase Program for such vehicle, other than (i)
isolated cases not exceeding 50 vehicles in any calendar month on average
or (ii) vehicles designated as "non-program" vehicles in accordance with
the Securitization Documents; and (b) sell or dispose of all vehicles not
subject to a Repurchase Program in accordance with the provisions of the
applicable lease or agreement. Each such lessee agrees that the vehicles
submitted for turn-in will be (other than immaterial instances of
non-compliance) in vehicle turn-in condition as specified in the applicable
Repurchase Program.

     Section 5.15 Tax Matters. Without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (including consent provided pursuant to Section 5.22, neither
Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) nor any Subsidiary (or any Affiliate of
a Subsidiary) shall, to the extent it may adversely affect or relate to any
Acquired Subsidiary, any Subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary, the Acquired
Assets or the Business, make or change any Tax election, change any annual
Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file
any amended Tax Return (except as required under the AutoNation Settlement
Agreement and AutoNation Side Letter), enter into any closing agreement,
settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax
refund, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or omit to take any other
action, if any such action or omission would have the effect of increasing
the Tax liability or reducing any Tax Asset of any (direct or indirect)
Acquired Subsidiary, any subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary, Purchaser or
any Affiliate of Purchaser. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Asset"
shall mean any net operating loss, net capital loss, Tax credit or other
Tax attribute which could reduce Taxes (including, without limitation,
deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes). Seller shall
also make or cause the relevant Acquired Subsidiary to make or cooperate
with Purchaser in making any lawful Tax election or application with
respect to any Acquired Subsidiary (or any subsidiary of an Acquired
Subsidiary) as reasonably requested by Purchaser.

     Section 5.16 Indemnification and Tax Returns.

          (a) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, each
Acquired Subsidiary, each direct and indirect subsidiary of an Acquired
Subsidiary and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
Affiliates (each, a "Purchaser Tax Indemnitee") with respect to any and all
Taxes that may be imposed on any Purchaser Tax Indemnitee or in respect of
the business or assets of any Purchaser Tax Indemnitee (i) with respect to
any taxable period of any Acquired Subsidiary, any direct or indirect
subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary or any Affiliated Group ending on or
prior to the Closing Date or allocated to Seller pursuant to Section 5.8
and the following paragraph of this Section 5.16, (ii) to the extent such
Taxes arise as a result of a breach or inaccuracy of any representation
contained in Section 3.17, (iii) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
or any comparable state, local or foreign Tax provision and (iv) as a
result of making any Section 338 Election; provided, however, that Seller
shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes are in excess of the
amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes on the Final Closing Working
Capital Statement. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the
Subsidiaries that are not Acquired Subsidiaries and each direct and
indirect subsidiary of such Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and Affiliates (each, a "Seller Tax
Indemnitee") with respect to any and all Taxes that may be imposed on (and
have not been refunded to) any Seller Tax Indemnitee or in respect of the
Business or assets of any Seller Tax Indemnitee (i) with respect to any
taxable period of any Acquired Subsidiary and any direct or indirect
subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary beginning after the Closing Date or
allocated to Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.8 and the following paragraph
of this Section 5.16; and (ii) with respect to liability for Taxes of any
Acquired Subsidiary and any direct or indirect subsidiary of an Acquired
Subsidiary resulting from any transaction involving such entities that
occurs on the Closing Date but after the Closing that is not pursuant to
this Agreement.

          (b) If, for any federal, state, local or foreign Tax purposes,
the taxable period of an Acquired Subsidiary or a direct or indirect
subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary does not terminate on the Closing Date
(any such period, a "Straddle Period"), Taxes, if any, attributable to such
Straddle Period shall be allocated to (i) Seller for the portion of such
Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date and (ii) Purchaser (or
its designated Affiliate) for the portion of such Straddle Period
subsequent to the Closing Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence,
Taxes for the portion of each Straddle Period up to and including the
Closing Date and for the portion of such Straddle Period subsequent to the
Closing Date shall be determined on the basis of an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date as if such Straddle
Period consisted of one taxable period ending on the Closing Date followed
by a taxable period beginning on the day following the Closing Date or
under such other reasonable method as the parties may agree. For purposes
of this Section 5.16(b), exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation,
shall be apportioned on a daily basis. For purposes of this Section 5.16
and the representations contained in Section 3.17, any Tax that is based in
whole or in part on income earned during a particular taxable period shall
be deemed to be a Tax attributable to and imposed in respect of such
taxable period; provided, that for purposes of this sentence, the term
"taxable period" shall include any portion of a taxable period that ends on
and includes the Closing Date.

          (c) Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns of each
Acquired Subsidiary and each direct and indirect subsidiary of an Acquired
Subsidiary for all taxable periods of each Acquired Subsidiary and each
direct and indirect subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary that end on or
prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that with respect to such Tax
Returns (not including, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns of any
Affiliated Group of which an Acquired Subsidiary or a direct or indirect
subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary is a member) that have due dates,
including all applicable extensions, after the Closing Date (any such
return, a "2002 Extended Return"), Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to prepare and file such 2002 Extended Returns before the Closing
Date. If, after using its reasonable best efforts, Seller is unable to file
any 2002 Extended Return, then Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing and
Purchaser shall be responsible for filing such 2002 Extended Return. All
such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis that is consistent with the
manner in which Seller prepared or filed such Tax Returns for prior
periods. Purchaser (or its designated Affiliate) shall be responsible for
filing all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of each
Acquired Subsidiary and each direct and indirect subsidiary of an Acquired
Subsidiary for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date. With respect
to any Tax Return required to be filed by Purchaser (or its designated
Affiliate) pursuant to this Section 5.16(c) for a Straddle Period of any
Acquired Subsidiary or any direct or indirect subsidiary of an Acquired
Subsidiary, Purchaser (or its designated Affiliate) shall provide Seller
with copies of such completed Tax Return and a statement setting forth the
amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to Debtors
pursuant to Section 5.16(b) (the "Statement") at least 30 days prior to the
due date for the filing of such Tax Return for Seller's review, comment and
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Seller and Purchaser agree to consult and to attempt to resolve in good
faith any disputes with respect to such Tax Return and the Statement. Not
later than five days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with
respect to such Tax Return, Seller shall pay to Purchaser (or its
designated Affiliate) an amount equal to the Taxes shown on the Statement
as being allocable to Seller pursuant to Section 5.16(b). If Seller and
Purchaser cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by Seller as reflected
on the Statement, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of Taxes shown
as due on the Statement. Within 10 days after such payment, Purchaser and
Seller shall refer the matter to the Accountants. Purchaser and Seller
shall equally share the fees and expenses of the Accountants. The
determination of the Accountants with respect to such Tax Return and
Statement shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties to this
Agreement. Within five days after the determination by the Accountants, if
necessary, either Purchaser or Seller shall pay the other any amount which
is determined by the Accountants to be owed.

     Section 5.17 Tax Cooperation.

          (a) Seller and Purchaser agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating
to the Acquired Assets and the Acquired Subsidiaries (and any of their
direct and indirect subsidiaries) as is reasonably requested for the filing
of Tax Returns and for the preparation for any audit, inquiry or judicial
proceeding related to Taxes or any Tax Return, or to otherwise understand
the Tax Liabilities or potential Tax Liabilities of the Acquired
Subsidiaries and their direct and indirect subsidiaries for all periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing.

          (b) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser as promptly as practicable
the following information (including supporting documentation when
requested): (i) the adjusted tax basis of each asset owned by any Acquired
Subsidiary (and any direct or indirect subsidiary of an Acquired
Subsidiary) and Seller's (and any affiliate of Seller's) adjusted tax basis
in the stock of each Acquired Subsidiary (and each direct and indirect
subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary); and (ii) any and all information
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with determining the
expected Tax consequences under the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 1502 of the Code resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Any and all information provided pursuant to this Section
5.17(b) shall be provided at Seller's expense and shall be the most current
information available.

     Section 5.18 Section 338(h)(10) Election. If Purchaser so requests by
written notice delivered not later than 90 days after the Closing Date,
then Seller and each appropriate affiliate of Seller shall join with
Purchaser in making a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
and any analogous provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law (each such
election, a "Section 338 Election") with respect to the purchase of the
stock of each Acquired Subsidiary and any deemed purchase of any direct or
indirect subsidiary of any Acquired Subsidiary (it being understood that
Purchaser may make such requests separately with respect to Section 338
Elections under the Code and under state, local and foreign Tax law and
with respect to any Acquired Subsidiary and any direct or indirect
subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary). If Purchaser requests that one or
more Section 338 Elections be made with respect to any Acquired Subsidiary
or any direct or indirect subsidiary of an Acquired Subsidiary, then
Purchaser shall determine the allocation of the Purchase Price and other
relevant items among the assets of the Acquired Subsidiary and, if
applicable, one or more of its direct or indirect subsidiaries.

     Section 5.19 Treatment of Tax Indemnity Payments. For United States
federal income Tax purposes, Purchaser and Seller shall treat any payments
made pursuant to Section 5.16 as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

     Section 5.20 ARG II Consent Procedures. The parties agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts on and after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing Date to obtain the consent of all of the Noteholders of the
Series 2002-2 Notes issued by ARG II to the sale of the Equity Securities
of ARG II to Purchaser; provided, that if the parties are unable to obtain
such consents Purchaser will seek to effect a re-financing of the Series
2002-2 Notes immediately following the Closing, and Seller and its
Subsidiaries will cooperate with Purchaser in connection with such
re-financing in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.2(b).

     Section 5.21 Transitional Services Agreement. Purchaser and Seller
shall as promptly as practicable, negotiate in good faith an agreement for
the provision after the Closing, on an arm's length basis, of transitional
services to each other in order to facilitate an orderly separation from
Seller and transition to ownership by Purchaser of the Acquired Assets, and
for the administration of the Seller's remaining assets and estate
following the Closing Date.

     Section 5.22 Internal Restructuring Transactions. Purchaser
acknowledges that Seller and the Subsidiaries desire to engage in a series
of transactions prior to the Closing (including making or changing Tax
elections, adopting a plan of complete or partial liquidation, dissolving,
merging, consolidating, restructuring, recapitalizing, reorganizing or any
comparable transaction) (collectively, the "Internal Restructuring
Transactions") designed in part to reduce or minimize Seller's or the
Subsidiaries' Tax liability in connection with the Bankruptcy Case. Seller
shall provide to Purchaser, no later than fourteen (14) days prior to
engaging in an Internal Restructuring Transaction (or any portion thereof),
a written notice that includes a description of the Internal Restructuring
Transaction (or such portion thereof) contemplated and its proposed
effective date. Neither Seller nor any Subsidiary shall engage in any
Internal Restructuring Transaction (or any portion thereof) without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, in its sole discretion. If Purchaser
approves any Internal Restructuring Transaction (or any portion thereof),
then Seller shall provide Purchaser with written confirmation that such
transaction (or such portion thereof) has occurred promptly after its
completion (including all documentation related to such transaction (or
such portion thereof)).

     Section 5.23 Certain Subsidiaries. (a) Purchaser sha1l have the right

Business Days prior to the date scheduled for the Bankruptcy Court hearing
on the Sale Approval Order.

          (b) If the Purchaser so elects in writing, Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to make Alamo Rent-A-Car (Canada) Inc.
("ARAC"), a party to this agreement for the sale and assumption of its
assets and liabilities (it being understood that the failure to so include
ARAC as a party to the Agreement shall not be a condition to Purchaser or
CCM to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or give rise
to a right for Purchaser or CCM to terminate this Agreement).

     Section 5.24 Payment of Interest. Immediately prior to the Closing
Date, Debtors shall pay all interest accrued during the month in which the
Closing occurs on the following facilities: (a) Amended and Restated Credit

representations and warranties qualified by materiality or Material Adverse
Effect, disregarding any such qualifications) as of the Closing (except to
the extent such representations and warranties are made as of a particular
date, in which case such representations and warranties shall have been
true and correct as of such date) unless, with respect to any failure of a
representation or warranty to be true and correct as of the Closing Date
(or such other particular date), such failure, together with all other
failures, would not result in or would not reasonably be expected to result
in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and

Acquired Subsidiary (or such Subsidiary thereof) contemplated hereby (other
than the consent of the Noteholders of the Series 2002-2 Notes, the
obtaining of which shall not be deemed a closing condition), in each case

absences, in the good faith determination of Purchaser, could result in or
could reasonably be likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect (without taking into account the failure to
obtain the consent of the Noteholders of the Series 2002-2 Notes). The
consents required by this Section 6.2(b) shall include, without limitation,

have become a Final Order provided, however, that, in the event an appeal
of the Sale Approval Order has been filed which results in the failure of
this condition to be met but no stay of the Sale Approval Order has been
granted, this condition shall be irrevocably waived if Purchaser does not
exercise its termination right under Section 7.1(a)(viii)(3) within 20 days
from the date the notice of appeal of the Sale Approval Order is filed.

close at the Closing set forth in Article VI is or becomes impossible to
fulfill (other than because of the failure of Debtors to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement or any Related Documents), and Debtors
have not waived such condition;

within 10 days after June 30, 2003, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have

               (vii) by either Debtors or Purchaser, if the Closing Date

Section 7.1(a)(viii)(3) if it does not exercise its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(viii)(3) within 30 days from the date
notice of appeal of the Sale Approval Order is filed), or if the Sale
Approval Order has been revoked, rescinded or modified in any material

party hereto (or any shareholder, director, officer, partner, employee,

severable, and in the event that any one or more provisions are deemed

remedy or claim hereunder (including to bring a suit at law or equity).

     Section 8.13 No Strict Construction. The parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. Consequently, in
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto,
