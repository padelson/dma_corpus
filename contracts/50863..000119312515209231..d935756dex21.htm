iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into
as of May 31, 2015, by and among: Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "); 615 Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "); and Altera Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain capitalized terms used in
this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_. 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger
(the " _Merger_ ") of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company in accordance
with this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "), with the Company to be the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and each share of Company Common
Stock (other than Disregarded Shares) to be thereupon canceled and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders; (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including the Merger; and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement; and 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition Sub have
approved this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

 

Section 1\. THE MERGER

 

1.1 Merger of Acquisition Sub into the Company. At the Effective Time, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the DGCL, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company. Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Corporation (which shall be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent), and the
separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease.

1.2 Effect of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
(a) of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Acquisition Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation; and (b) debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Acquisition Sub will become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 201 Redwood
Shores Parkway, Redwood Shores, California, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be
designated by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the second
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in _Section 6_ (other than those
conditions, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions), or at
such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing by the parties.
The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_." Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate
of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the DGCL shall be duly
executed by the Company in connection with the Closing and, concurrently with
or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the
date and time of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (the time as of which the Merger becomes
effective being referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended in its entirety pursuant to the Merger at the Effective Time or
immediately thereafter to conform to the certificate of incorporation of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Altera Corporation" and,
as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Legal Requirements;

(b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at
the Effective Time or immediately thereafter to conform to the bylaws of
Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and, as
so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirements;
and

(c) the directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

1.5 Conversion of Shares. 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any stockholder
of the Company:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by the Company (or held in
the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 



2 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent other
than Acquisition Sub shall remain issued and outstanding and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) any shares of Company Common Stock then held by Parent or Acquisition
Sub shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (the shares of Company
Common Stock referred to in clauses "(i)," "(ii)" and "(iii)," the "
_Disregarded Shares_ ");

 

(iv) except as provided in clauses "(i)," "(ii)" and "(iii)" above and subject
to  _Section 1.5(b)_ and _Section 1.7_, each share of Company Common Stock
then outstanding shall be converted into the right to receive (upon the proper
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock
in accordance with _Section 1.6_) cash equal to $54.00 (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), without interest thereon and subject to any required Tax
withholding; and

 

(v) each share of the common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Acquisition
Sub then outstanding shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) If, during the Pre-Closing Period, the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, or if a record date with respect to any such event
shall occur during such period, then the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted.

1.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive the funds for purposes of
effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration contemplated by _Section
1.5(a)(iv)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount representing the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_ in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to be paid in respect
of Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares by the Paying Agent in accordance
with this Agreement. Such funds deposited with the Paying Agent are referred
to herein as the " _Payment Fund_." Such funds shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof
by the Paying Agent to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. No loss to the funds in the
Payment Fund will affect any payment obligations of Parent under this
Agreement.

 



3 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to the Persons who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, were record holders of certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock (" _Stock Certificates_ ") or non-certificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (in
each case, other than Disregarded Shares and Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Stock
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Stock Certificates to the
Paying Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of a Stock Certificate
or a Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent for exchange, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal (in respect of Stock Certificates) or the
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) (in respect of
Book-Entry Shares) and such other documents as may be reasonably required by
the Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to  _Section
1.5(a)(iv)_ in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share; and (B) the Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
shall be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of
Company Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other
than the holder in whose name the Stock Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if any such Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and such holder shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to a
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 1.6(b)_, each Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent
solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Stock Certificate or Book-
Entry Share. If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition to the payment of
any cash amount pursuant to  _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct)
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Stock Certificate. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
1_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares will not be required to deliver a Stock
Certificate or a signed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to
receive the Merger Consideration to which that holder is entitled.

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date 180 days after the date
on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and any holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have
not theretofore surrendered their Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _Section 1.6_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for payment pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_.
None of Parent,

 



4  Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to
any other Person with respect to any cash amounts properly delivered to any
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law
or similar applicable Legal Requirement.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, holders of Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
Stock Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in this _Section 1.6_.

(e) The Paying Agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Paying Agent,
Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Corporation determines in good faith
is required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the extent that any such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) If any Stock Certificate has not been surrendered by the date immediately
prior to the date on which the cash amount that such Stock Certificate
represents the right to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

1.7 Dissenting Shares. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shares of
Company Common Stock held by holders who have made a proper demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and have otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_, but shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed automatically to
have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
1.5(a)(iv)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of a Stock Certificate
or Book-Entry Share representing such shares in accordance with _Section
1.6_.

 



5 (c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt
notice of any (A) demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; (B) withdrawal of any such demand; and
(C) other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity, at Parents
expense, to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make
any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its prior
written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

 

1.8 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Acquisition
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Acquisition Sub, in the
name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

Section 2\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document filed with the SEC on or after
January 1, 2014 and prior to the date of this Agreement and publicly

preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "); (ii) that transactions are executed only
in accordance with the authorization of management; (iii) that access to
assets that could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements

ensure that all material information concerning the Acquired Companies is made
known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of
the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents, and

material respects the consolidated financial position of the Acquired
Companies as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Acquired Companies for the periods covered
thereby (subject, with respect to unaudited interim statements, to normal and

Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities

Company to distribute any material proprietary source code for such
Company Product under the terms of an Open Source Software license, and to
the knowledge of the Company, there would be no reasonable basis for such a

operations.

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent
orally and in writing: (i) upon becoming aware that any representation or
warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of
any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it

 



41  pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the Merger set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing; (ii) of any notice from any Person alleging that the
Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger;
and (iii) of any Legal Proceeding commenced against any of the Acquired
Companies that relates to the Merger. No notification given to Parent pursuant
to this _Section 4.2(d)_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any of the remedies available to Parent hereunder.

 

(e) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall promptly notify the Company
orally and in writing: (i) upon becoming aware that any representation or
warranty made by it or Acquisition Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate, or of any failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that
such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any
of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger
set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ to fail to be satisfied
at the Closing; and (ii) of any Legal Proceeding commenced against Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries that relates to the Merger. No notification given
to Parent pursuant to this _Section 4.2(e)_ shall limit or otherwise affect
any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Parent or Acquisition
Sub contained in this Agreement or any of the remedies available to the
Company hereunder.

(f) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall cause each of the
Acquired Companies to withdraw from, cease membership or affiliation with, or
otherwise terminate relationships with, or restrict its activities with
respect to, each standards-setting organization, university or industry body
or consortia, or other multi-party special interest group (collectively, "
_Standards Bodies_ "), in each case as reasonably requested by Parent and to
the extent the relevant Acquired Company has the legal or contractual ability
to do so. To the extent the relevant Acquired Company does not have the
legal or contractual ability to take an action requested by Parent under this
_Section 4.2(f)_, the Company shall cause each Acquired Company to use
reasonable efforts to take all actions that limit the extension of any
intellectual property obligations of the Standards Bodies to Parent,
including, where necessary, by using reasonable efforts to obtain any consents
necessary to permit it to take the requested action. It is the intent of
Parent and the Company that any such withdrawal, cessation, termination or
restriction take place as close as possible to the Closing and be conditioned
on the Closing. The relevant Acquired Company may satisfy the requirements of
this _Section 4.2(f)_ by taking action reasonably calculated to be effective
prior to the reasonably anticipated Closing Date, and where the relevant
Acquired Company has the ability to do so, it may make any such withdrawal,
cessation, termination or restriction contingent upon the Closing.

 

4.3 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Other than with respect to Parent or Acquisition Sub, during the Pre-
Closing Period the Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any
Acquired Company or any Representatives of the Acquired Companies to: (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making,
submission or announcement of an Acquisition Proposal (or 

 



42  any proposal, offer or indication of interest that would be reasonably
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal); (ii) furnish or otherwise
provide access to any non-public information regarding any of the Acquired
Companies to any Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal (except to refer such Person to these
provisions).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the time that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained,
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from furnishing non-
public information regarding the Acquired Companies to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with any Person and its Representatives in
response to (and in connection with), a bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal that is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn)
if: (i) no Acquired Company and no Representative of any Acquired
Company shall have breached _Section 4.3(a)_ with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal or such Person; (ii) the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice
of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Offer; (iii) the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after having
taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements
of the State of Delaware; and (iv) at least two Business Days prior to
furnishing any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Company: (A) gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to
furnish non-public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person; and (B) receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a
copy of, an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary
limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written and oral
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies
and containing other confidentiality provisions no less favorable to the
Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (and that shall
permit the Company to comply with the terms of _Section 4.3(c)_) and prior to
or concurrently with furnishing any such non-public information to such
Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent (to the
extent that such non-public information has not been previously furnished by
the Company to Parent). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that any action if taken by the Company or any
other Acquired Company that would be a breach of the provisions set forth in
the preceding sentence that is taken by any Representative of any of
the Acquired Companies shall be deemed to constitute a breach of _Section
4.3(a)_ by the Company.

(c) If the Company or any other Acquired Company or any of their respective
Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public
information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal at any time prior to
the Requisite Stockholder Approval being obtained, then the Company shall
promptly (and within 24 hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or
request is known to the board of directors of the Company or the Companys
Chief Executive Officer) advise Parent orally and in writing of
such Acquisition Proposal or request (including the identity of the Person
making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or request, the material terms
and conditions thereof, and, if available, copies of any written documentation
received by such Acquired Company setting forth such terms and

 



43  conditions). The Company shall keep Parent informed with respect to the
status of any such Acquisition Proposal or request and any modification or
proposed modification thereto and shall promptly (and in no event later than
24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to: (i) begin
providing information in response to a request for non-public information in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this _Section
4.3_. The Company shall provide Parent with 48 hours prior notice (or such
lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the board of directors
of the Company) of any meeting of the board of directors of the Company at
which the board is expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal, request for
non-public information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
Intervening Event.

(d) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, except as contemplated
by _Section 4.3(b)_, the Company shall, shall cause the Subsidiaries of the
Company to, and shall instruct the Representatives of the Acquired Companies
to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Person that relate to an
Acquisition Proposal or request for non-public information in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall:
(i) request each Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub and their
Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement or similar
agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition
Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies; and
(ii) except as contemplated by  _Section 4.3(b)_, prohibit any third party
(other than Parent, Acquisition Sub and their Representatives) from having
access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a possible
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(f) Except as permitted by _Section 4.3(g)_ or _Section 4.3(h)_, neither the
board of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall: (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, the Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that
the Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed to have been modified in a
manner adverse to Parent if it shall no longer be unanimous) or resolve or
agree to take any of the actions contemplated by this clause "(i)" (any
action described in this clause "(i)" being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or (ii) approve, accept or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, accept or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or cause
or permit the Acquired Companies to execute or enter into, any (A) letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle; (B) merger
agreement; (C) acquisition agreement; (D) option agreement; (E) joint venture
agreement; (F) partnership agreement; or (G) Contract providing for an
Acquisition Transaction, in each case other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section 4.3(b)(iv)(B)_, or resolve or agree to take any of
the actions contemplated by this clause "(ii)".

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 4.3(f)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company may, at
any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance

 



44  with _Section 7.1(h)_ if (and only if): (i) a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of the provisions of
this _Section 4.3_ is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement
and is not withdrawn; (ii) the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after having taken into account the advice of an independent
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the
Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Offer, and that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_ would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements
of the State of Delaware (it being understood that the actions of the board
of directors of the Company in making and disclosing (to the extent legally
required) such determination shall not be considered to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to violate _Section 4.3(f)_); (iii) prior to
effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_, the board of directors of the Company shall
have given Parent at least five Business Days prior written notice (it being
understood that such notice and the actions of the board of directors of the
Company in authorizing and disclosing (to the extent legally required) such
notice shall not be considered to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or to
violate  _Section 4.3(f)_): (A) that it has received a Superior Offer that
did not result from a breach of the provisions of this _Section 4.3_; (B)
that it intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_ as a result of such
Superior Offer; and (C) specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Offer, including the identity of the Person making such offer (and
attaching the most current version of any written offer or proposed Contract
relating thereto, including, if the Company proposes to terminate this
Agreement under _Section 7.1(h)_, a copy of the proposed written, definitive
acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by such Superior Offer (such acquisition agreement, a "
_Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement_ ")) (it being understood and
agreed that any change to the consideration payable in connection with such
Superior Offer or any other material modification thereto shall again require
compliance with the terms of this _Section 4.3(g)_ by the Company, except
that the time periods in clauses "(iii)" and "(iv)" shall be two Business
Days); (iv) during such five Business Day notice period, the Company engages
(to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Acquisition Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Offer; and (v) at the time of any Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination of this Agreement under _Section
7.1(h)_, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after taking into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement under _Section 7.1(h)_ would be inconsistent with
the fiduciary obligations of the board of directors of the Company to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements of the State of
Delaware in light of such Superior Offer (taking into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations
required by clause "(iv)" or otherwise).

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 4.3(f)_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company may, at
any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, make an Adverse Recommendation Change if: (i) there shall occur or
arise after the date of this Agreement an event, development or change in
circumstances that relates to and is material to the Acquired

 



45  Companies (taken as a whole) (but does not relate to any Acquisition
Proposal) that was not known to the board of directors or senior management of
the Company on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of
which are not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the board of directors or
senior management of the Company), which event, development or change in
circumstance, or any material consequences thereof, becomes known to the
board of directors or senior management of the Company prior to the adoption
of this Agreement by the Requisite Stockholder Approval and did not result
from or arise out of the announcement or pendency of the Contemplated
Transactions (any such material event, material development or material
change in circumstances unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal being referred to
as an " _Intervening Event_ "); (ii) the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice of an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and the
advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Legal Requirements of the State of Delaware (it being
understood that the actions of the board of directors of the Company in
making and disclosing (to the extent legally required) such determination
shall not be considered to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or to violate
_Section 4.3(f))_; (iii) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation
Change, the board of directors of the Company shall have given Parent three
Business Days prior written notice (it being understood that such notice and
the actions of the board of directors of the Company in authorizing and
disclosing (to the extent legally required) such notice shall not be
considered to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or to violate _Section
4.3(f)_): (A) containing a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening
Event; and (B) stating that the board of directors of the Company intends to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event; (iv)
during such three Business Day notice period, the Company engages (to the
extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations
of the board of directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements of the State of Delaware in light of such
Intervening Event; and (v) at the time of any Adverse Recommendation Change,
the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
taking into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the board of directors of the
Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements of
the State of Delaware in light of such Intervening Event (taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of
the negotiations required by clause "(iv)" or otherwise).

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the board of directors of the Company from: (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after having
taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements of the State of
Delaware; or (iii) refering any Person to these provisions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this

 



46   _Section 4.3(i)_ shall not be deemed to permit the board of directors of
the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the
actions referred to in clause "(ii)" of _Section 4.3(f)_ except, in each
case, to the extent permitted by _Section 4.3(g)_ and _Section 4.3(h)_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of both clause "(i)" and
clause "(ii)" any such disclosure, other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the board of directors of the Company expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

(j) Unless such actions are taken in connection with a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_, the Company shall not, except
to the extent required by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, take any
action to approve any transaction under, or any other third party becoming an
"interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL.

 

4.4 Company Equity Awards and ESPP.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or any other parties, each Company Option
that is then outstanding, unvested and held by a Continuing Service Provider
and not described in the following sentence (a " _Continuing Option_ ") shall
be assumed by Parent. A Company Option shall not be considered a Continuing
Option if the Company Option is subject to the Legal Requirements of a
non-U.S. jurisdiction and Parent determines the Company Option may not be
converted into a Continuing Option: (i) under a Legal Requirement of the
relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction (including by reason of a failure to obtain
any required regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable best
efforts); (ii) under the policies and practices of Parent with respect to the
grant of equity awards in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction; or (iii) due to
Parents administrative practices with respect to equity awards. Parent shall
notify the Company at least 20 days (40 days, in the case of Company Options
held by directors) prior to the Effective Time of the Company Options that
will not be Continuing Options pursuant to the previous sentence. Each
Continuing Option assumed by Parent shall continue to have, and be subject to
the same terms and conditions of such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including the vesting restrictions, except for administrative
changes that are not adverse to the holder of the Continuing Option or to
which the holder consents and except that: (A) each Continuing Option shall
be exercisable for a number of shares of common stock of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of the Continuing
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by a
quotient obtained by dividing (a) the Merger Consideration; by (b) the average
closing price of Parent Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market for the five
trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Effective Time
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares
of Parent Common Stock; and (B) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Continuing Option shall
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise price
for such Continuing Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; and (C) all
references to the " _Company_ " in the applicable Company Equity Incentive
Plans and the applicable Company Option agreements shall be references to
Parent. It is the intention of the 

 



47  parties that each Company Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify
following the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code
and to the extent such Company Stock Option qualified as an incentive stock
option prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part Parent, the
Company or any other parties, each Company Option that is outstanding and
vested by its terms and each outstanding and unvested Company Option that is
not a Continuing Option (each, a " _Terminating Option_ ") shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time and shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price of such option; by (ii) the number
of Company Shares subject to each Terminating Option, less all applicable
deductions and withholdings required by Legal Requirements to be withheld in
respect of such payment. Each Terminating Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time that has an exercise
price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled as
of the Effective Time without consideration therefor and the holder of such
Terminating Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or any other parties, each Company RSU that
is then outstanding, unvested and held by a Continuing Service Provider and
not described in the following sentence (a " _Continuing RSU_ ") shall be
assumed by Parent. A Company RSU shall not be considered a Continuing RSU if
the Company RSU is subject to the Legal Requirements of a non-U.S.
jurisdiction and Parent determines the Company RSU may not be converted into a
Continuing RSU: (i) under a Legal Requirement of the relevant non-U.S.
jurisdiction (including by reason of a failure to obtain any required
regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable best efforts); (ii)
under the policies and practices of Parent with respect to the grant of equity
awards in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction; or (iii) due to Parents
administrative practices with respect to equity awards. Parent shall notify
the Company at least 20 days prior to the Effective Time of the Company RSUs
that shall not be Continuing RSUs pursuant to the previous sentence. Each
Continuing RSU assumed by Parent shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions of such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including the vesting restrictions, except for administrative
changes that are not adverse to the holder of the Continuing RSU or to which
the holder consents and except that: (A) each Company RSU shall cover a number
of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that would be
issuable under the Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (B) all references to the " _Company_ "
in the applicable Company Equity Incentive Plans and applicable Company RSU
agreements shall be references to Parent.

 

(d) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part Parent, the
Company or any other parties, each Company RSU that is not a Continuing RSU
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the
Effective Time (each, a " _Terminating RSU_ "). Each holder of a Terminating
RSU shall be eligible to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to (i) the Merger Consideration;

 



48  multiplied by (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to each Terminating
RSU, less all applicable deductions and withholdings required by Legal
Requirements to be withheld in respect of such payment.

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or any other parties, each outstanding
Company PRSU that is then outstanding, unvested and held by a Continuing
Service Provider and not described in the following sentence (a " _Continuing
PRSU_ ") shall be assumed by Parent. A Company PRSU shall not be considered a
Continuing PRSU if the Company PRSU is subject to the Legal Requirements of a
non-U.S. jurisdiction and Parent determines the Company PSU may not be
converted into a Continuing PRSU: (i) under a Legal Requirement of
the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction (including by reason of a failure to
obtain any required regulatory consents or approvals after making reasonable
best efforts); (ii) under the policies and practices of Parent with respect to
the grant of equity awards in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction; or (iii)
due to Parents administrative practices with respect to equity awards. Parent
shall notify the Company at least 20 days prior to the Effective Time of the
Company PRSUs that shall not be Continuing PRSUs pursuant to the previous
sentence. Each Continuing PRSU assumed by Parent shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company PRSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting restrictions, except for
administrative changes that are not adverse to the holder of the Continuing
PRSU or to which the holder consents and except that: (A) each Company PRSU
shall cover a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares
that would be issuable under the Company PRSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (B) all references
to the " _Company_ " in the applicable Company Equity Incentive Plans and
Company PRSU agreements shall be references to Parent.

 

(f) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or any other parties, each Company PRSU that is not a Continuing PRSU
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the
Effective Time (each, a " _Terminating PRSU_ "). Each holder of a Terminating
PRSU shall be eligible to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to (i) the Merger Consideration; multiplied by (ii)
the number of Company Shares subject to each Terminating PRSU, less all
applicable deductions and withholdings required by Legal Requirements to
be withheld in respect of such payment.

(g) Subject to the consummation of the Merger, the ESPP shall terminate
effective upon the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time: (i) the
Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to: (A) cause any
outstanding offering period underway as of the Effective Time under the ESPP
to be terminated as of the last Business Day prior to the Effective Time (the
" _Offering Period_ "); (B) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period
for all purposes under the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of the last
Business Day prior to the Effective Time) of each outstanding purchase right
under the ESPP; (D) ensure that no individual shall be permitted to make a
new election to purchase shares in any current offering period (other than
initial elections by newly-hired employees

 



49  pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the ESPP existing as of
the date hereof) or increase such participants election to purchase shares in
any current offering period; and (E) provide notice to participants in the
ESPP describing the treatment of the ESPP pursuant to this _Section 4.4(g)_;
and (ii) the Company shall not amend, or take any action to amend, the ESPP
to: (A) increase the maximum payroll deduction rate in effect as of the date
hereof; or (B) allow participation by individuals who are not otherwise
eligible to participate in the ESPP as of the date hereof.

 

(h) At the Effective Time, if Parent determines that it desires to do so,
Parent may assume any or all of the Company Equity Incentive Plans or merge
any such Company Equity Incentive Plan into any equity incentive plan of
Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any Company Equity Incentive
Plan, then, under such Company Equity Incentive Plan, Parent shall be entitled
to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable Legal
Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Equity Incentive Plan
as of the Effective Time, except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall
be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Equity
Incentive Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common
Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) the board of
directors of Parent or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the board of directors of the Company or any committee
thereof with respect to the administration of such Company Equity Incentive
Plan.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions,
including providing notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to
each holder of an outstanding award granted pursuant to any Company Equity
Incentive Plan describing the treatment of such award in accordance with this
_Section 4.4_.

 

(j) Parent shall take such actions relating to Company Equity Awards,
including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock, as
are reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 4.4_. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (to the extent available) with respect to the Parent
Common Stock subject to such Continuing Options, Continuing RSUs and
Continuing PRSUs and shall use reasonable best efforts to have such
registration statement declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, but in no event later than 10 Business Days
following the Effective Time. It is intended that the treatment of Continuing
Options, Continuing RSUs and Continuing PRSUs under this _Section 4.4_ shall
cause such equity awards to remain exempt from or comply with Section 409A of
the Code and this _Section 4.4_ shall be construed consistent with such
intent.

Section 5. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

5.1 Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable (and within 15 Business Days
after the date of this Agreement, if practicable), the Company shall prepare
and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide,
as promptly as reasonably practicable, such information regarding Parent and
Acquisition Sub as is required and is

 



50  reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.
Other than with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change and disclosures
relating thereto, the Company shall consult with Parent and provide Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto (and to review and comment
on any comments of the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement or any
amendments or supplements thereto), and shall reasonably consider all comments
made by Parent, prior to the filing thereof. The Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and
all other applicable Legal Requirements. The Company shall promptly provide
Parent and its counsel with a copy or description of any comments received by
the Company or its legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, and shall respond
promptly to any such comments. Subject to compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the earlier of: (i)
receiving notification that the SEC or its staff is not reviewing the Proxy
Statement; and (ii) the conclusion of any SEC or staff review of the Proxy
Statement. If any event relating to any of the Acquired Companies occurs, or
if the Company becomes aware of any information, that should be disclosed in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, then the Company shall
promptly inform Parent thereof and shall promptly file such amendment or
supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, mail such amendment or supplement
to the stockholders of the Company.

 

5.2 Company Stockholders Meeting.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal
Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of
Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose
of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company Stockholders
Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company and reasonably
acceptable to Parent) as promptly as practicable after the commencement of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, subject to the
Companys right to postpone or adjourn the meeting as set forth in  _Section
5.2(c)_. The Company shall cause all proxies solicited in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting to be solicited in compliance with all
applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 4.3(g)_ and _Section 4.3(h)_, the Proxy Statement
shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of the
Company: (i) has unanimously determined and believes that the Merger is
advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders; (ii) unanimously recommends that the Companys stockholders
vote to adopt this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (iii)
has unanimously approved this Agreement and unanimously approved the
Contemplated Transactions in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL.
(The unanimous determination by the board of directors of the Company that
the Merger is advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders and the unanimous recommendation of the board of
directors of the Company that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt this
Agreement are collectively referred to as the " _Company Board
Recommendation_.") Unless it has been withdrawn, the Company shall ensure that
the Proxy Statement includes the Fairness Opinion of the Company Financial
Advisor.

 



51 (c) Subject to the termination rights set forth in _Section 7.1_, the
Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with _Section 5.2(a)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement,
submission or making of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, by
any Intervening Event or by any Adverse Recommendation Change. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees not to adjourn,
postpone or cancel (or propose to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Company
Stockholders Meeting (without Parents prior written consent), except to the
extent required to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting if and to the
extent that (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of
Company Common Stock present or represented by a proxy at the
Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Company uses its reasonable best efforts during
any such postponement or adjournment to obtain such a quorum as soon as
practicable; (ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting by applicable Legal Requirement or a request from the
SEC or its staff and the Company uses its reasonable best efforts to hold or
resume the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable thereafter;
or (iii) the board of directors of the Company shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by
applicable Legal Requirement to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting, including in order to give the Companys stockholders sufficient time
to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to
stockholders or otherwise made available to stockholders by issuing a press
release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise. If a tender or exchange
offer relating to shares of Company Common Stock shall have been commenced and
the Company has not yet sent to its stockholders a statement disclosing the
recommendation of the board of directors of the Company in respect of such
offer, then the Company will postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting until after the Company sends such recommendation.

 

5.3 Regulatory Approvals.

 

(a) Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to submit
promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental Body.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent
shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file the
notification and report forms required to be filed under the HSR Act and any
notification or other document required to be filed under any applicable
foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirement in the
jurisdictions set forth on _Section 6.1(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
(including a Form CO with the European Commission based on Council Regulation
139/2004) in connection with, the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as practicable
to: (i) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission
or the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation; and
(ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general,
foreign antitrust or competition authority or other Governmental Body in
connection with antitrust or related matters. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or take any other action
with respect to any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired
Companies, provided that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger.

 



52 (b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent and the Company each shall promptly supply the other with
any information which may be required in order to effectuate any filings
(including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its
obligations set forth in) _Section 5.3(a)_ (disclosure of which may be
restricted to outside counsel). To the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, each of Parent and the Company shall consult and cooperate with
one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act
or any applicable foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirement.
Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other in connection
with the making of all such filings or responses.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of: (i) any communication from any official of any Governmental Body
in connection with any filing made pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) knowledge
of the commencement or threat of commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or
before any Governmental Body with respect to the Contemplated Transactions
(and shall keep the other party informed as to the status of any such Legal
Proceeding or threat); and (iii) any request by any official of any
Governmental Body for any amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant
to this Agreement or any information required to comply with any Legal
Requirements applicable to the Contemplated Transactions. Whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to 
  _Section 5.3(a)_, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall
(promptly upon learning of the occurrence of such event) inform the other of
the occurrence of such event and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Body such amendment or supplement.

(d) Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Merger and make
effective the other Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if
any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such
party in connection with the Contemplated Transactions; and (ii) shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be
obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Contract, or
otherwise) by such party in connection with the Contemplated Transactions,
including taking all reasonable actions and doing all things reasonably
necessary to (A) resolve any objections, if any, as any Governmental Body may
assert under any applicable antitrust or competition-related Legal
Requirement with respect to the Contemplated Transactions; and (B) avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any applicable
foreign antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirement that may be
asserted by any applicable Governmental Body or Persons with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions so as to enable the Contemplated Transactions to be
consummated as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement, including
for purposes of the preceding clauses "(A)" and "(B)," such reasonable
undertakings and commitments as may be reasonably requested by any applicable
Governmental Body in sufficient time to allow the conditions to this
Agreement to be satisfied on or before the Outside Date. The parties shall
consult with each other with

 



53  respect to all of the matters contemplated in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of
the preceding sentence, and each party will keep the others apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the Contemplated Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to,
and, except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
take any action to, and shall not allow any of the Acquired Companies to,
consent or proffer to divest or hold separate any business or assets of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries. 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall
contest and litigate and defend against any Legal Proceeding brought by or
pending before any Governmental Body and promptly and expeditiously appeal any
order, writ, injunction, judgment or decree in any Legal Proceeding, (i)
challenging or seeking to make illegal, delaying materially or
otherwise directly or indirectly restraining or prohibiting the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions; (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any
respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates of all or any portion
of the business or assets of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or to require any such person to dispose of, license (whether
pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any
portion of the business or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or of
any of the Acquired Companies, in each case as a result of, or in connection
with, the Contemplated Transactions; (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly,
to impose or confirm limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its
affiliates to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation on all matters properly presented to the stockholders
of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, respectively; (iv) seeking to
require divestiture by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or of any of the
Acquired Companies of any shares of Company Common Stock or any business or
assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Companies; or (v)
that would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the Contemplated Transactions or that would reasonably be
expected to dilute materially the benefits to Parent of the Contemplated
Transactions, except so far as any of the prohibitions, limitations,
conditions or requirements referred to in this  _Section 5.3(e)_ are covered
by any commitments made to any Governmental Body in order to satisfy the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

(f) Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter
into or publicly announce an agreement to form a joint venture or acquire any
assets, businesses or companies if Parent believes that any such agreements,
individually or in the aggregate, would cause any of the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 6.1(c)_,  _Section 6.1(d)_ and _Section
6.2(e)_ to fail to be satisfied prior to the Outside Date.

5.4 Employee Benefits.

(a) If so directed by Parent at least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the board of directors of the Company shall, at least one Business Day
prior to the Effective Time, adopt resolutions terminating any and all
Employee Benefit Plans intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _401(k) Plan_ "), effective
no later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
Parent (which 

 



54  approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and the
Company shall provide Parent evidence that such resolutions have been adopted
by the board of directors of the Company or the board of directors of any
other Acquired Company, as applicable. The Company shall take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may
reasonably request.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and hereby agrees to, assume the
obligations and succeed to the rights of the Company under (i) each of the
Change of Control and Severance Agreements set forth on _Section 5.4(b)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Change of Control and Severance Agreements_
"); and (ii) the Retention Bonus Plan.

 

(c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain, for Continuing Employees,
compensation (other than equity-based compensation) at levels that, taken as a
whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation (other
than equity-based compensation) provided to the Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For one year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain the
Severance Practice (as defined in _Section 2.15(a)(i)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule) for any Continuing Employees who are terminated without cause.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
deemed to make any employee of the parties or their respective Subsidiaries a
third party beneficiary of this _Section 5.4_ or provide any such employee
any rights relating to this _Section 5.4_, including any right to continued
employment, any right to continue an Employee Benefit Plan (except as provided
in _Section 5.4(b)_) following the Closing Date or prevent the amendment
thereof, or any right to treat this Agreement as an amendment to an
Employee Benefit Plan.

5.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent that the Surviving
Corporation is permitted to indemnify under applicable Legal Requirements,
each Person who is now or was prior to the Effective Time an officer or
director of the Acquired Companies and each person who is now or was prior to
the Effective Time an officer or director of the Acquired Companies who
served as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan of
the Acquired Companies (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (each, an
" _Indemnified Person_ ") against any costs or expenses, judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, arbitration,
proceeding or investigation in respect of, or arising out of, acts or
omissions by such Indemnified Person in his her capacity as an officer or
director of the Acquired Companies, or a fiduciary under or with respect to
any employee benefit plan of the Acquired Companies, occurring, or alleged to
have occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 5.5(a)_ then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, for six years
after the Effective Time,

 



55  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to advance, to the extent that
the Surviving Corporation is permitted to advance under applicable Legal
Requirement, prior to the final disposition of any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation for which
indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request
by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, action, suit,
arbitration, proceeding or investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any advancement of expenses pursuant to this _Section 5.5(a)_ shall be
conditioned upon the Surviving Corporations receipt of an undertaking by or
on behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall be
ultimately determined by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
_Section 5.5(a)_. In the event of any such action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the defense of any
such action.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of
the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors
and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as
of the date of this Agreement in the form disclosed by the Company to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO Policy_"), to the
extent that such directors and officers liability insurance coverage is
available on commercially reasonable terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i)
the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy
or policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any
substitute policies) in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid prior to
the date of this Agreement by the Company for the Existing DandO Policy (the "
_Maximum Premium_ "). In the event any future annual premiums for the Existing
DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium in the
aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of
coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount
of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium.
At the Companys option, it may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, and in
lieu of Parents obligations under this _Section 5.5(b)_, a six-year prepaid
(i) "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the Existing DandO Policy with respect to matter arising before the
Effective Time; and/or (ii) policy providing for Side B coverage. In
connection with the policies contemplated by the foregoing sentence, (A) the
Company will not spend more than $3,000,000 in the aggregate for such policies
without the prior written consent of Parent; and (B) Parent shall cause any
such policies to be maintained in full force and effect for their full term,
and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. If the Company elects not to purchase either of the foregoing
policies, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to do so in
lieu of complying with their obligations under this _Section 5.5(b)_.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of that
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provisions to be made prior to the consummation of any
transaction of the type described in clause "(i)" or "(ii)" so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_.

 



56 (d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
agree not to, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
advancement of expenses, exculpation and indemnification provisions of the
agreements listed on _Section 5.5(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e) This _Section 5.5_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Persons and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Each
Indemnified Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.5_
and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this  _Section 5.5_. If
any Indemnified Person makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses under this _Section 5.5_ that is denied by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Indemnified Person is entitled to such indemnification, then Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay such Indemnified Persons costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with
pursuing such claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The rights of
the Indemnified Persons under this _Section 5.5_ shall be in addition to any
rights that such Indemnified Person may have under the
organizational documents of the Acquired Companies or under any applicable
Contracts, insurance policies or Legal Requirements.

5.6 Public Announcement. Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and the

_provided_ , _however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this

,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement shall not be
available to a party during the pendency of a Legal Proceeding by the other

(g) by the Company if: (i) any of Parents representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this
Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date

representation and warranty made as of a specific earlier date)), such that
the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ would not be satisfied; or (ii)
Parent shall have breached any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ would

inaccuracy or failure to perform has been cured prior to termination; or (2)
the Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants or agreements
hereunder; or

 

(h) by the Company (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval), following compliance with  _Section

7.2_, _Section 7.3_, _Section 8_ and the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than paragraph 12 which shall be superseded and shall cease to have any force
or effect as of the date of this Agreement) shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability
for any fraud or willful and intentional breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

 

7.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.3_, all fees and expenses incurred

their affiliates for all documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees

$60,000,000 in the aggregate. The Expenses shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds promptly (and in any event within two Business
Days) following submission of statements therefor.

 



63 (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to (x) _Section 7.1(c)_ or (y) _Section 7.1(d)_ (and at the time of
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ the Company has breached (and failed
to cure) its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting); and (ii)
(A) at or prior to the time of such termination and following the date of this
Agreement an Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction shall have
been publicly disclosed; and (B) within 12 months after the date of any such
termination, any Acquisition Transaction is consummated or a definitive

Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the earlier of the time such
Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the time such definitive agreement
is executed, a non-refundable fee in the amount of $500,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") less any Expenses previously paid pursuant to _Section
7.3(a)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
7.3(b)_, all references to "15%" in the definitions of Acquisition Transaction
and Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(h)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash concurrently with and
as a condition to such termination, the Termination Fee.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.1(e)_,

to _Section 7.1(b)_ (as it relates to any antitrust or competition-related
Legal Requirements); (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ due to a
breach by Parent of _Section 5.3_ that results in the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1(b)_ (as it relates to any antitrust or competition-related
Legal Requirements), _Section 6.1(c)_, _Section 6.1(d)_ or _Section 6.2(e)_
(as it relates to any antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirements) not
being satisfied; or (C) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_; and (ii) at the time of such termination (A) all conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ are satisfied other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and
other than one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_ (as it
relates to any antitrust or competition-related Legal Requirements), 
_Section 6.1(c)_, _Section 6.1(d)_ or _Section 6.2(e)_ (as it relates to

Business Days following any such termination, pay to the Company or its
designee in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company a non-refundable fee in the amount of $500,000,000
(the " _Regulatory Fee_ ").

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this  _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Merger, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either party fails to pay when due any
amount payable under this  _Section 7.3_, then: (i) the non-performing party
shall reimburse the other party for all costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such
overdue amount and the enforcement by the other party of its rights under
this _Section 7.3_; and (ii) the non-performing party shall pay the other
party interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the
date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and

 



64  ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate
per annum equal to 500 basis points over the "prime rate" (as announced by
Bank of America or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid. The parties acknowledge and agree
that in no event shall a party be required to pay the Termination Fee or the
Regulatory Fee on more than one occasion. Each of the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Regulatory Fee is not a
penalty, but constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company in circumstances in which the Regulatory Fee
is payable. In the event that this Agreement is duly terminated under the
circumstances described in _Section 7.3(e)_ and the Regulatory Fee is payable
pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_, then the Companys right to receive payment of
the Regulatory Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Acquired Companies and their respective stockholders and
Affiliates against Parent, any of Parents current or future Affiliates and
any of their respective current or future Representatives for any and all
losses that may be suffered resulting from, and the Acquired Companies (on
their own behalf and on behalf of their respective stockholders and
affiliates) shall be deemed to have waived all other remedies with respect
to, a failure of the Merger to be consummated, and any breach by Parent or
Acquisition Sub of its obligation to consummate the Merger or any other
covenant, obligation, representation, warranty or other provision set forth
in this Agreement. Upon payment of the Regulatory Fee in accordance with
_Section 7.3(e)_, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Merger.

7.4 Procedure for Termination. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_ shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of each
of Parent and Acquisition Sub, action by its board of directors or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, the duly authorized
designee of its board of directors, and in the case of the Company, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, action by the board of
directors of the Company or a committee thereof. Termination of this Agreement
prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
Companys stockholders. The terminating party shall provide written notice of
termination to the other parties specifying with reasonable particularity the
basis (and applicable provision) for such termination.

 

Section 8\. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 

8.1 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended with the approval of the
respective boards of directors of the Company and Parent at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment shall be made that by
applicable Legal Requirements requires further approval of the stockholders
of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

8.2 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may: (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and

_Section 8.1_ and to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
waive compliance with any of the agreements or covenants of the other parties
or any condition that

 



65  exists in favor of the waiving party contained herein. No failure on the
part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party in exercising any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of
such power, right, privilege or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of
any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No
party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement,
or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the
waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set
forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such
party, and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except
in the specific instance in which it is given.

8.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. This _Section 8.3_ shall
not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time. 

8.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts.

 

(a) This Agreement (including all Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the other
agreements referred to in this Agreement constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement
(other than paragraph 12, which shall be superseded and shall cease to have
any force or effect as of the date of this Agreement) shall not be superseded
and shall remain in full force and effect.

 

(b) This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and
will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such counterpart, to
the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment
to email (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be treated in
all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No party may raise the use of an
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of an
Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each
party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such defense
relates to lack of authenticity.

 

8.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws

execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and
instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by a
party to evidence or reflect the Contemplated Transactions and to carry out
the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

 

8.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other

of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree to negotiate

8.12 Enforcement. Each party acknowledges and agrees that irreparable harm
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed by either party in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by either party of any provision of this Agreement, the
other party shall be entitled to, without proof of actual damages (and the
breaching party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy): (a) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such provision; and
(b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. The foregoing
will be in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law or in equity. Without limiting the provisions of _Section 7.3(f)_, the
availability of Expenses pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, the Termination Fee
pursuant to  _Sections 7.3(b)_, _7.3(c)_ or _7.3(d)_ and the Regulatory Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.3(e)_ shall not be a basis for denying specific
performance or an injunction contemplated by this _Section 8.12_.

following March 31 is May 1).

(l) The information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedule
is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by any party to
any third Person of any matter whatsoever, including (i) any violation of law
or breach of contract; or (ii) that such information is material or that such
information is required to be referred to or disclosed under this Agreement.

 



71 (m) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties of risks associated with particular
matters. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely on the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.
