-viii- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 29,
2003, by and among HOMETOWN AMERICA, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Purchaser_ "), HOMETOWN AMERICA HOLDINGS, L.L.C., a Delaware
limited liability company and a member of Purchaser (" _Parent_ "), CP
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Maryland limited partnership (" _Chateau OP_ "),
CHATEAU COMMUNITIES, INC., a Maryland corporation and a general partner of
Chateau OP (" _Chateau_ "), and ROC COMMUNITIES, INC., a Maryland corporation
and the other general partner of Chateau OP (" _ROC_ ").



RECITALS



A. Parent and Purchaser have formed two Maryland limited liability companies,
the first of which newly formed limited liability company (the " _Merger Sub_
") shall have only one member, which one member shall be Purchaser, and the
second of which newly formed limited liability company (the " _Partnership
Merger Sub_ ") shall have only one member, which one member shall be Merger
Sub.



B. The Board of Directors of Chateau has determined that it is advisable and
in the best interest of Chateau and its stockholders, and the Advisory Board
of Purchaser has determined that it is advisable and in the best interest of
Purchaser and its members, that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Chateau will be merged with and into the Merger
Sub, with the Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the merger (the
" _Merger_ "), in which (except for any shares of Chateau Common Stock that
are owned by Chateau or by Chateau OP immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which shall automatically be canceled pursuant to Section 1.7(b)) each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Chateau
(the " _Chateau Common Stock_ ") will be converted into the right to receive
$29.25 in cash without interest (the " _Common Stock Merger Consideration_ ").



C. Parent and Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub, as the sole managing member
of Partnership Merger Sub, to deem it advisable and in the best interests of
Partnership Merger Sub and its members, and Chateau and ROC, as the sole
general partners of Chateau OP, deem it advisable and in the best interests
of Chateau OP and its limited partners, that, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, immediately prior to the Merger,
Partnership Merger Sub shall merge with and into Chateau OP (the "
_Partnership Merger_ " and together with the Merger the " _Mergers_ "), with
the holders (the " _OP Unit Holders_ ") of each common unit of limited partner
interest in Chateau OP (each, an " _OP Unit_ " and collectively, the " _OP
Units_ ") at the time of the Partnership Merger either (x) receiving (except
for OP Units as to which appraisal rights are exercised and perfected pursuant

AGREEMENT



In consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto hereby
agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



Section 1.1  _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Sections 3-101 _et seq_. of
the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), and Sections 4A-701
_et seq_. of the Maryland Limited Liability Company Act (the " _MLLCA_ "),
Chateau shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub being the
surviving entity (the " _Surviving Company_ ").



Section 1.2 _The Partnership Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Sections 10-208
_et seq_. of the Maryland Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the "
_MRULPA_ "), and Sections 4A-701 _et seq_. of the MLLCA, immediately prior to
the consummation of the Merger, Partnership Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into Chateau OP, with Chateau OP being the surviving entity (the "
_Surviving Partnership_ "). The sole general partner of the Surviving
Partnership shall be Merger Sub.



Section 1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date to be specified
by the parties, which shall be no later than the third business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), but
in any event shall not be earlier than 90 days after the date hereof unless
an earlier date is consented to by Purchaser (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the
offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, NY
10019, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.



Section 1.4 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V, (a) Merger
Sub and Chateau shall execute and file the Articles of Merger, in accordance
with the MGCL and the MLLCA, with the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of the State of Maryland (the " _Department_ "), and shall make all
other filings and recordings



 

-2- required under such statutes with respect to the Merger, and (b) Partnership
Merger Sub and Chateau OP shall execute and file the Partnership Articles of
Merger, in accordance with the MRULPA and the MLLCA, and shall make all other
filings and recordings required under such statutes with respect to the
Partnership Merger. The Mergers shall become effective (each an " _Effective
Time_ " and collectively, the " _Effective Times_ ") at such time, as
permitted by the MGCL, the MLLCA or the MRULPA, as the case may be, as (i)
Merger Sub and Chateau shall agree should be specified in the Articles of
Merger and (ii) Partnership Merger Sub and Chateau OP shall agree should be
specified in the Partnership Articles of Merger. Unless otherwise agreed or
contemplated by the terms hereof, the parties shall cause the Effective Times
to occur on the Closing Date with the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger
occurring immediately before the Effective Time of the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in the event that every condition to
the Closing has been satisfied or waived pursuant to the terms hereof other
than approval of the Partnership Merger and related transactions by the
holders of the 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of
Chateau OP (the " _Series A Units_ "), then, in such event, Purchaser and
Chateau shall reasonably cooperate (1) to effect the Merger and the
transactions related thereto (but not the Partnership Merger and the
transactions related thereto) at the Effective Time on the Closing Date
pursuant to the terms hereof, (2) at the Effective Time of the Merger, (a) to
issue to the holders of Series A Units a notice of redemption, which
redemption shall be effective 31 days after the Closing (the " _Second
Closing Date_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Chateau OP Agreement,
and (b) to commit to effect the Partnership Merger, including making available
the Partnership Merger Consideration, in each case upon the terms (including
Section 1.9) hereof, (3) on the Second Closing Date, (x) to redeem such
Series A Units and (y) to effect the Partnership Merger pursuant to the terms
hereof, with the redemption of the Series A Units occurring immediately before
the Partnership Merger, and (4) to amend the Chateau OP Agreement as of the
Effective Time of the Merger so as to eliminate the right of holders of OP
Units to have OP Units converted or redeemed during the period from the
Closing Date through the Second Closing Date. In the event the provisions of
the prior sentence become applicable because every condition to the Closing
has been satisfied or waived pursuant to the terms hereof other than approval
of the Partnership Merger and related transactions by the holders of
the Series A Units and there shall accordingly be a Second Closing Date on
which the Effective Time for the Partnership Merger shall occur, then (x)
provision shall be made by Purchaser and Chateau so that holders of OP Units
shall have the right and ability to exchange their OP Units for the
Partnership Merger Consideration following the Effective Time of the Merger
and prior to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, subject to the
otherwise applicable terms hereof with respect to the receipt of the
Partnership Merger Consideration, and (y) references herein to the Closing
Date and the Effective Time shall be deemed, as appropriate, to be references
to either the Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, and to either
the Effective Time of the Merger or the Effective Time of the Partnership
Merger, in each case as appropriate in the context in which such terms are
used.



Section 1.5 _Operating Agreement; Directors; Officers_. The Operating
Agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect after the Merger as the
Operating Agreement of the Surviving Company, until further amended in
accordance with the terms of such Operating Agreement and applicable Maryland
law. The directors or managers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time of the
Merger shall, from and after the Effective Time of the Merger, be and become
the directors or managers of the Surviving Company until their successors
shall have been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the governing instruments of the
Surviving Company and applicable Law. The officers of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time of the Merger shall, from and after the Effective Time of the
Merger, be and become the officers of the Surviving Company until their
successors shall have been duly appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the governing instruments of
the Surviving Company.



 

-3- Section 1.6  _Agreement of Limited Partnership and Certificate of Limited
Partnership_. The Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of
Chateau OP, dated as of January 22, 1997, as amended (the " _Chateau OP
Agreement_ "), and the Certificate of Limited Partnership of Chateau OP as in
effect as of the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, shall continue in
full force and effect until the Partnership Merger, upon the consummation of
which, the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Partnership Merger Sub
shall become the Partnership Agreement of the Surviving Partnership (the "
_Surviving Partnership Agreement_ "), with such changes necessary to reflect
the issuance, rights and other terms of the Partnership Securities, until
further amended in accordance therewith and applicable Maryland law.



Section 1.7 _Conversion of Equity Securities in the Merger_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of any shares of capital stock of Chateau or membership interests of
Merger Sub:



(a) _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. The issued and outstanding
membership interests of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger shall remain outstanding as the issued and outstanding membership
interests of the Surviving Company.



(b) _Cancellation of Chateau-Owned Stock_. Each share of Chateau Common Stock
beneficially owned by Chateau shall be treated in the Merger in the same
manner as any other authorized but unissued share of Chateau Common Stock. All
authorized but unissued shares of Chateau Common Stock shall be cancelled for
no consideration in the Merger and shall not have any right to the
Merger Consideration.



(c) _Common Stock Merger Consideration_. Each share of Chateau Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 1.7(b)) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration. At
the Effective Time of the Merger all shares of Chateau Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger represented any such shares (each a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration described above
and to receive any dividends declared, in accordance with the terms hereof,
payable to holders of record of shares of Chateau Common Stock as of a record
date preceding the Effective Time of the Merger, and unpaid as of the
Effective Time of the Merger. Following the Effective Time of the Merger,
upon surrender of Certificates representing shares of Chateau Common Stock in
accordance with Section 1.8, the Surviving Company shall pay to the holders of
such Certificates as of the Effective Time of the Merger any such dividends
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.



(d) _Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.



(i) In connection with the Merger, (A) each option (each, a " _Chateau Option_
" and collectively, the " _Chateau Options_ ") to purchase Chateau Common
Stock granted under Chateaus 2002, 2001, 1999, 1997 and 1993 Equity
Compensation Plans or under the CWS Communities Trust 1998 Long Term Incentive
Plan or under any other stock option plan pursuant to which options to
purchase Chateau Common Stock have been granted to Chateau employees and
service providers (collectively, the " _Chateau Option Plans_ ") which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, whether or
not then vested or exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable,
and (B) any restrictions or limitations with respect to Chateau Common Stock
awarded under the Chateau Option Plans shall terminate or lapse so that such
shares shall be freely transferable (and whereby the provisions of Section
1.7(c) shall apply to such shares in accordance with their terms). At the
Effective Time of the



 

-4- Merger, Purchaser shall pay Chateau sufficient cash to enable Chateau to pay,
and Chateau shall pay, to each holder of a Chateau Option, subject to
applicable withholding, cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Chateau Common Stock subject to such Chateau Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share provided for in such Chateau Option. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the exercise price per share provided for in any Chateau
Option exceeds the Common Stock Merger Consideration, no cash shall be paid
with regard to such Chateau Option to the holder of such Chateau Option.
Immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, all outstanding
Chateau Options shall automatically be canceled.



(e) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Common Stock Merger
Consideration payable upon the cancellation of Chateau Common Stock shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, combination,
subdivision, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
stock dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Chateau Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Chateau Common Stock (or for which a record date is established) after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.



Section 1.8  _Surrender of Certificates_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Purchaser
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Chateau to
act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates representing Chateau Common Stock (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to enable, and shall cause, the
Surviving Company to provide to the Paying Agent immediately following the
Effective Time of the Merger the Common Stock Merger Consideration payable in
exchange for the shares of Chateau Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7(c),
plus any amounts payable in respect of unpaid dividends as contemplated by
Section 1.7(c) (such consideration being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").



(b)  _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time of
the Merger, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Person (as defined herein) shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and
have such other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Common Stock Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Purchaser, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Common Stock Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares formerly represented by such
Certificate pursuant to Section 1.7(c), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Chateau Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of
Chateau, payment may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Purchaser that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall
be paid or shall accrue on the Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.



(c) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All cash paid upon the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Chateau Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate. At



 

-5- the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time of the Merger
occurs the stock transfer books of Chateau shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Company of the shares of Chateau Common Stock that were outstanding,
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. If, after the
Effective Time of the Merger, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Company or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.



(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Chateau Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to the Surviving
Company, upon demand, and any holder of Chateau Common Stock who has
not theretofore complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Company for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.



(e) _No Liability_. Neither Purchaser, the Chateau OP nor the Surviving
Company shall be liable to any Person for any part of the Merger
Consideration or for unpaid dividends or for any distributions with respect
thereto delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law (as defined herein). Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such shares five years after the Effective Time
of the Merger or at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
federal, state, local government, or agency or any court, regulatory or
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their
successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.



(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Purchaser, on a daily basis;
_provided, however,_ that such investments shall be in (i) obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America, (ii) commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, (iii) certificates of deposit maturing not
more than 180 days after the date of purchase issued by a bank organized
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof having a combined
capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000, or (iv) a money market fund
having assets of at least $3,000,000,000. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Chateau OP.



(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.



(h) _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser, Chateau OP, the Surviving Partnership,
the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Chateau Common Stock, such amounts
as it is required to withhold with respect to such payments under the Code
(as defined herein) or any other provision of state, local or foreign tax
law.



(i) _Tax Treatment_. Chateau hereby confirms, covenants and agrees that this
Agreement shall constitute its plan of liquidation within the meaning of
Section 562(b)(1) of the Code and that its Board of Directors has (or prior
to that date on which the Effective Time of the Merger occurs, will) adopt
this



 

-6- Agreement as such a plan of liquidation and all distributions of the Common
Stock Merger Consideration shall be treated as liquidating distributions,
except as may be required by a Determination as defined under Section 1313(a)
of the Code (a " _Determination_ ").



Section 1.9 _Conversion of Equity Securities in the Partnership Merger_. At
the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, by virtue of the Partnership
Merger and without any action on the part of any OP Unit Holder or holder of
membership interests of Partnership Merger Sub:



(a) _Ownership Interests of Partnership Merger Sub_. The issued and
outstanding membership interests in Partnership Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger shall be converted into the
number of OP Units held by OP Unit Holders (other than the number of OP Units
converted into Partnership Securities) as of such time.



(b) _Partnership Merger Consideration_. The consideration to be paid to the
OP Unit Holders and Series A Unit Holders in the Partnership Merger is as
follows (the " _Partnership Merger Consideration_ " and, together with the
Common Stock Merger Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):



(i) Each OP Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Partnership Merger (other than OP Units held by Chateau and ROC and other than
any Dissenting OP Units) shall be exchanged for cash in the amount of
the Common Stock Merger Consideration per OP Unit, without interest, provided
that if any OP Unit Holder submits to Purchaser a duly and validly completed
Form of Election (as defined herein) in accordance with the procedures and
time periods specified in Section 4.2(c), and otherwise satisfies the
requirements set forth herein and therein, such OP Unit Holder shall instead
receive for each OP Unit then held by it a Preferred Security Unit in the
Surviving Partnership (the " _Partnership Security_ "), the terms of which
Partnership Security shall be set forth in the Surviving Partnership Agreement
and which shall reflect the terms set forth in the term sheet attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_.



(ii) Any OP Units outstanding and held by Chateau or ROC immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger shall remain outstanding.



(iii) At the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, each holder of a
Chateau OP Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Partnership Merger shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except
the right to receive the applicable Partnership Merger Consideration and to
receive any distributions declared, in accordance with the terms hereof,
payable to holders of record of Chateau OP Units as of a record
date preceding the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, and unpaid as of
the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger. Following the Effective Time of
the Partnership Merger, upon delivery to the Paying Agent of such duly
executed documents, including a Form of Election, as may be required by the
Paying Agent or Purchaser, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Surviving
Partnership shall pay to such former holders of OP Units as of the Effective
Time of the Partnership Merger any such distributions which remain unpaid at
the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger.



(iv) Effective as of the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, without any
further act or action on behalf of Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary or any
holder of OP Units, all DRO (Deficit Restoration Agreements) elections and
agreements set forth on Section 2.1(k)(vii) of the disclosure letter dated as
of the date of this Agreement and delivered to Purchaser in connection with
the execution hereof (the " _Chateau Disclosure Letter_ ") shall be
terminated and shall no longer require Chateau to incur or maintain any
recourse or nonrecourse indebtedness of any amount thereafter, nor shall
Chateau nor any Chateau Subsidiary have any continuing rights or
liabilities thereunder.



 

-7- (c) _Objectors  Rights to an Appraisal_. Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, each OP Unit outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Partnership Merger or consented thereto in writing and
who has demanded appraisal (" _Dissenting OP Unit Holder_ ") for such OP Unit
in accordance with Section 10-208(f) of the MRULPA, to the extent such Section
10-208(f) of the MRULPA provides for appraisal rights for such OP Units in the
Partnership Merger (" _Dissenting OP Units_ "), shall not be converted into
or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Partnership Merger
Consideration, unless and until such Dissenting OP Unit Holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment
under the MRULPA. If, after the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger, any
such Dissenting OP Unit Holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his
right to appraisal, such Dissenting OP Units shall thereupon be treated as if
such OP Units had been converted as of the Effective Time of the Partnership
Merger into the right to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration, if any,
to which such Dissenting OP Unit Holder is entitled, without interest or
dividends thereon. Chateau OP shall give Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any
demands received by Chateau OP for appraisal of OP Units, attempted written
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
MRULPA and received by Chateau OP relating to OP Unit Holders rights to
appraisal with respect to the Partnership Merger, and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any exercise of such
appraisal rights under the MRULPA. Neither Chateau OP nor Chateau or any
Chateau Subsidiary shall, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for payment of fair
value for partnership interests of Chateau OP, offer to settle or settle any
such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.



(d) _Series A Units_. Each Series A Unit that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Partnership Merger and that has not been
previously redeemed shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
except the right to receive such amount in cash as would have been payable had
the Series A Units been redeemed as of the Effective Date of the Partnership
Merger.



(e) _Adjustments to Partnership Merger Consideration_. The Partnership Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, combination, subdivision, split, reverse split, distribution
of securities convertible into OP Units, reorganization, recapitalization
or other like change with respect to OP Units occurring (or for which a
record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.



(f) _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser, Chateau OP, the Surviving Partnership,
the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of OP Units, such amounts as it is
required to withhold with respect to such payments under the Code (as
defined herein) or any other provision of state, local or foreign tax law.



(g) _Tax Treatment of the Partnership Merger_. The parties hereby confirm,
covenant and agree to treat the Partnership Merger, for all income tax
purposes as (i) a sale by the Selling OP Unit Holders of their OP Units in
Chateau OP to Purchaser in exchange for cash, and (ii) for Continuing OP Unit
Holders, tax-deferred exchange of their former partnership interest in Chateau
OP for Partnership Securities, including filing Chateau OP Tax Returns
consistent with such treatment, and no party shall take any position
inconsistent with such treatment. __



Section 1.10 _Procedures for Exchange of OP Units in the Partnership Merger_.
Except for the provisions relating to the Certificates, all other provisions
of Section 1.8 shall apply to Chateau OP and the OP Units with respect to the
Partnership Merger, except as otherwise provided in Section 1.9.





 

-8- ARTICLE II



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES



Section 2.1 _Representations and Warranties of Chateau_. Chateau, Chateau OP
and ROC represent and warrant to Purchaser, the Merger Sub and Partnership
Merger Sub as follows:



(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power of Chateau_. Chateau is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Maryland and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Chateau is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business it is conducting, or the ownership, operation or leasing of its
properties or the management of properties for others makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
or would not reasonably be expected to have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect.
For the purposes of this Agreement, a " _Chateau Material Adverse Effect_ " is
any event, change, circumstance or effect which would have or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business,
assets, liabilities, properties (including their mortgageability or the terms
on which they are mortgageable), condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of Chateau, Chateau OP and the Chateau Subsidiaries (as
defined herein) taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of Chateau or any of the
Chateau Subsidiaries to perform any of its or their obligations hereunder or
consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that a
Chateau Material Adverse Effect shall not include any change with respect to
Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary resulting from or attributable to (i)
general national, international or regional economic or financial conditions,
(ii) the announcement, pendency or consummation of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, or
(iii) conditions generally affecting the industries in which Chateau and the
Chateau Subsidiaries operate. Chateau has heretofore made available to
Purchaser complete and correct copies of Chateaus charter, as amended (the "
_Chateau Charter_ "), and by-laws, as amended (the " _Chateau By-laws_ ").
Each jurisdiction in which Chateau is qualified or licensed to do business and
each assumed name under which it conducts business in any jurisdiction are
identified in Section 2.1(a) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter.



(b) _Chateau Subsidiaries; Interests in Other Persons_. (i) Each Chateau
Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Chateau
Subsidiary, including Chateau OP, that is a partnership, limited liability
company or trust is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its business as now being conducted. Each Chateau Subsidiary, including
Chateau OP, is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or the management of
properties for others makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other
than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Chateau Material Adverse Effect. All outstanding shares of capital stock and
other equity securities of each Chateau Subsidiary that is a corporation have
been duly authorized, are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,
and are not subject to any preemptive rights and are owned by Chateau or
another Chateau Subsidiary, except as disclosed in Section 2.1(b)(i) of the
Chateau Disclosure Letter, and are so owned free and clear of all pledges,
claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever (each, a " _Lien_ " and collectively, " _Liens_ "). All
equity interests and other equity securities in each Chateau Subsidiary,
including Chateau OP, that is a partnership, limited liability company, trust
or other entity that



 

-9- have been duly authorized and are validly issued and are owned by Chateau or
another Chateau Subsidiary, except as disclosed in Section 2.1(b)(i) of the
Chateau Disclosure Letter, and are so owned free and clear of all Liens.
Chateau has heretofore made available to Purchaser complete and correct copies
of the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of each of the
Chateau Subsidiaries, each as amended to date. Section 2.1(b)(i) of the
Chateau Disclosure Letter sets forth (A) all Chateau Subsidiaries and their
respective jurisdictions of incorporation or organization, (B) each owner and
the respective amount of such owners equity interest in each Chateau
Subsidiary, and (C) a list of each jurisdiction in which each Chateau
Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business and each assumed name under
which each such Chateau Subsidiary conducts business in any jurisdiction.



(ii) Except for the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the

specified in Section 2.1(d) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter and receipt of
the Chateau Partner Approval, and assuming the Transaction Documents to which

Letter, the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by Chateau or
each applicable Chateau Subsidiary does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and compliance with



 

-12- the provisions hereof or thereof, will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any material obligation, or give rise to a right of purchase under, result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Chateau or

therein following the Merger), or (C) assuming the consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits and filings or notifications referred to in Section

not reasonably be expected to have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect.

Letter, no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, or permit from any Governmental Entity,
is required by or with respect to Chateau or any of the Chateau Subsidiaries

documents otherwise required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (2) such reports under Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange

with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, as may be

declaration, filing or permit that the failure to obtain or make (1)
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Chateau Material Adverse Effect or (2) individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to, materially impair the ability of Chateau to
perform its obligations hereunder or prevent or delay in any material respect
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(e) _SEC Documents_. Chateau and Chateau OP have made available to Purchaser
(by public filing with the SEC or otherwise) a true and complete copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed
by either Chateau or Chateau OP with the SEC since January 1, 2000 (the "
_Chateau SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, the Chateau SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such Chateau SEC Documents and none of the Chateau SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later Chateau SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement. The consolidated financial statements of
Chateau and Chateau OP included in the Chateau SEC Documents complied in all
material



 

-13- respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto, or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as
permitted by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and fairly
presented, in accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to normal, recurring adjustments, none of which are
material), the consolidated financial position of Chateau and the Chateau
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of their respective dates and the
consolidated statements of income and the consolidated cash flows of Chateau
and the Chateau Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein. Other than
Chateau and Chateau OP, no other Chateau Subsidiary is required to make any
filing with the SEC.

Agreement or as disclosed in Section 2.1(f) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter,

setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in
cash, stock or property) with respect to any of Chateaus capital stock; (B)
any amendment of any term of any outstanding equity security of Chateau or any
Chateau Subsidiary; (C) any repurchase, redemption or other acquisition by
Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary of any outstanding shares of capital stock
or other equity securities of, or other ownership interests in, Chateau or any
Chateau Subsidiary; or (D) any change in any method of accounting or
accounting practice or any tax method, practice or election by Chateau or any
Chateau Subsidiary; or (ii) any split, combination or reclassification of any
of Chateaus capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of any
issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution
for, or giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise, shares of its
capital stock or any issuance of an ownership interest in, any
Chateau Subsidiary. Except as disclosed in the Chateau SEC Documents filed
prior to the date hereof, or as disclosed in Section 2.1(f) of the Chateau
Disclosure Letter, from March 31, 2003, (i) Chateau and the Chateau
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not been any Chateau Material
Adverse Effect, and (iii) except as disclosed in the Chateau Disclosure
Letter, neither Chateau nor any Chateau Subsidiary has taken any of the
actions set forth in Section 3.1(b).



(g)  _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the
Chateau SEC Documents, or as set forth in Section 2.1(g) of the Chateau
Disclosure Letter, there are no liabilities or obligations of Chateau or any
of the Chateau Subsidiaries, whether (x) accrued, contingent, absolute or
determined or (y) otherwise required by GAAP to be set forth on a balance
sheet of Chateau or Chateau OP, other than: (i) liabilities adequately
provided for on the balance sheet of Chateau and Chateau OP dated as of March
31, 2003 (including the notes thereto), or (ii) liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business subsequent to March 31, 2003 that would not be or
would not reasonably be expected to be a Chateau Material Adverse Effect. 



(h) _No Default_. Except as set forth in Section 2.1(h) of the Chateau
Disclosure Letter, neither Chateau nor any of the Chateau Subsidiaries is in
default or violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or violation) of, and no
notice of any default or acceleration of Indebtedness has been received from
any lender in connection with, any term, condition or provision of (i) the
Chateau Charter or the Chateau By-laws or the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any of the Chateau Subsidiaries, (ii) any
Material Contract (as defined herein), or (iii) any order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Chateau or any of the
Chateau Subsidiaries, except in the case of (iii) for defaults or violations
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect. Section 2.1(h) of the Chateau
Disclosure Letter includes an explanation of the nature of any such default
disclosed



 

-14- therein, penalties associated therewith and actions taken by Chateau or any
Chateau Subsidiary, if any, to cure or renegotiate said contracts.



(i)  _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Chateau and the Chateau Subsidiaries
hold all certificates, permits, licenses, variances (including building
permits and certificates of occupancy), exemptions, orders, franchises and
approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses and the occupancy and operation of the Chateau
Properties (the " _Chateau Permits_ "), except where the failure so to hold
such Chateau Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect. Chateau and the Chateau
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Chateau Permits, except
where the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in the Chateau SEC Documents, the businesses of Chateau and the
Chateau Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any Law, except
for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect.



(j) _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Chateau SEC Documents or as set
forth in Section 2.1(j) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter and except for
routine litigation arising from the ordinary course of business of Chateau and
the Chateau Subsidiaries which are adequately covered by insurance and which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Chateau Material Adverse Effect, there is no suit, claim, investigation,
action or other proceeding (including any mortgage foreclosure proceeding)
pending or, to the Knowledge (as defined herein) of Chateau, threatened
against or affecting or involving Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary or any of
the Chateau Properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in the Chateau SEC Documents or in Section 2.1(j) of the Chateau
Disclosure Letter, neither Chateau nor any of the Chateau Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective properties or assets, is subject to any order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award which has or is
reasonably likely to have a Chateau Material Adverse Effect.



(k) _Taxes_.



(i) Each of Chateau and the Chateau Subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax
Returns (as defined herein) required to be filed by it (after giving effect
to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having
authority to do so), except where the failure to file would not individually
or in the aggregate be material to Chateau. Each such Tax Return is accurate
and complete in all material respects. Chateau and each Chateau Subsidiary
has paid (or Chateau has paid on its behalf), all Taxes that are shown as due
and payable on such Tax Returns. All material Taxes which Chateau or the
Chateau Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including
Taxes required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing
to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third
party and sales, gross receipts and use taxes, have been duly withheld or
collected and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper
Governmental Entities. The most recent financial statements contained in the
Chateau SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement
reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by Chateau and the
Chateau Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of such financial statements. Chateau and each Chateau Subsidiary
has established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to establish and
maintain) on its books and records reserves that are adequate for the payment
of all Taxes not yet due and payable. Since December 31, 1997, Chateau has
incurred no liability for any material Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or
4981 of the Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5, or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6 including any material Tax arising from
a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and
neither Chateau nor any of the Chateau Subsidiaries has incurred any material
liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of



 

-15- business other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the
sales of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a risk that any material Tax described in the preceding
sentence will be imposed on Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary. No deficiencies
for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge
of Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary, proposed) against Chateau or any of the
Chateau Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary does not file
Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, which
individually or in the aggregate would be material, and no requests for
waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in
effect or are pending. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of
Chateau or the Chateau Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes not
yet due.



(ii) Chateau (A) for all taxable periods since its inception and ending at the
Effective Time, Chateau has been subject to taxation as a real estate
investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of the Code and has
satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for all such years, (B) has
operated, and intends to continue to operate, consistent with
the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the
Effective Time, and (C) has not taken or omitted to take any action which
could reasonably be expected to result in a loss of its status as a REIT, and
no challenge to Chateaus status as REIT is pending, or to Chateaus
Knowledge, is or has been threatened. Each Chateau Subsidiary which is a
partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has since its
acquisition by Chateau been classified for federal income tax purposes as a
partnership or disregarded entity and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the
meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code. Neither Chateau nor any
Chateau Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the disposition of which would be
subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as announced in IRS
Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5 or Treasury Regulation
Section 1.337(d)-6, (y) that is subject to a consent filed pursuant to
Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Each Subsidiary of
Chateau that is or is taxed as a corporation or is treated as an association
taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes and that is owned
directly or indirectly by Chateau or ROC is listed in Section 2.1(k)(ii) of
the Chateau Disclosure Letter and, except as set forth in Section 2.1(k)(ii)
of the Chateau Disclosure Letter, is either a "qualified REIT subsidiary"
within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code or a "taxable REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l)(1) of the Code. Each
subsidiary of Chateau that is a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning
of Section 856(l)(1) of the Code is set forth in Section 2.1(k)(ii) of the
Chateau Disclosure Letter. Each subsidiary of Chateau that is a "qualified
REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code is set
forth in Section 2.1(k)(ii) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter. As of the
Effective Time, each subsidiary of Chateau that is a "qualified REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code shall have
been merged or otherwise converted into a limited liability company that is
treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes. Chateau is
not a foreign person within the meaning of Section 1445(b)(2) of the Code.



(iii) Neither Chateau nor ROC has any earnings and profits attributable to
Chateau or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of
Section 857 of the Code. Neither Chateau nor any of its Subsidiaries has made
any election, and is not required, to treat any of its assets or the assets
of any Subsidiary as owned by another person for tax purposes (other than by
reason of a Subsidiary being a "qualified REIT subsidiary" or a "disregarded
entity" for federal income tax purposes and any comparable provision of
state, local or foreign law).



(iv) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(k)(iv) of the Chateau Disclosure
Letter, neither Chateau nor the Chateau Subsidiaries have made any payments,
are obligated to make any payments, or are parties to an agreement that could
obligate them to make any payments that will not be deductible under Section
280G of the Code. Chateau and the Chateau Subsidiaries have disclosed to the
IRS all



 

-16- positions taken on their federal income Tax Returns which could give rise to a
substantial understatement of Tax under Section 6662 of the Code.



(v) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(k)(v) of the Chateau Disclosure
Letter, neither Chateau nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or is subject
to any written ruling of a taxing authority related to Taxes or has entered
into any written and legally binding agreement with a taxing authority
relating to Taxes.



(vi) Other than the Limited Partner Tax Agreements listed on Section
2.1(k)(vi) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter, neither Chateau nor any of its
Subsidiaries (a) is a party to or is otherwise subject to any Tax allocation
or sharing agreement, or (b) has any liability for Taxes of another person
under law, by contract or otherwise except for withholding Taxes incurred in
the ordinary course of business that have been properly withheld but are not
yet required to be deposited with a Tax authority.



(vii) Neither Chateau nor any of the Chateau Subsidiaries has entered into or
is subject, directly or indirectly, to any Limited Partner Tax Agreements (as
defined herein) other than those that are disclosed in Section 2.1(k)(vii) of
the Chateau Disclosure Letter, true and correct copies of which have been
provided to Purchaser and Parent. Chateau and each of its Subsidiaries have
complied with all material terms of the Limited Partner Tax Agreements. Other
than the restrictions on the Chateau Properties listed in Section 2.1(k)(vii)
of the Chateau Disclosure Letter which are imposed by those Limited Partner
Tax Agreements listed as items I, I(A), II, III and IV in said Section
2.1(k)(vii) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter, there are no restrictions on
the sale, exchange, or other disposition, financing or other transactions
applicable to any Chateau Properties or with respect to any of their
respective assets and no obligations to maintain any particular amounts of
debt. 



(viii) None of Chateau or any of its Subsidiaries has distributed stock of
another person, or has had its stock distributed by another person, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Code Section 355.



(ix) This Agreement shall constitute Chateaus plan of liquidation within the
meaning of Section 562(b)(1) of the Code and Chateaus Board of Directors
prior to that date on which the Effective Time of the Merger occurs, will
adopt this Agreement as such a plan of liquidation.



(x) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(k)(x) of the Chateau Disclosure
Letter, Chateau has the right to make or to require, and, after the Effective
Time will continue to have the right to make or to require, each Chateau
Subsidiary that is subject to federal income tax as a partnership to make, in
the manner provided in Section 1.754-1(b) of the Treasury Regulations, an
election under Section 754 of the Code (and any corresponding elections under
state or local tax law) to adjust the basis of its property as provided in
Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.



(xi) To the Knowledge of Chateau as of the Closing Date, neither Chateau nor
any Chateau Subsidiary is a party to any understanding or arrangement
described in Section 6111(c), Section 6111(d) or Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(iii) of
the Code, or has "participated" in a "potentially abusive tax shelter" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4 (without regard to
Section (b)(3) thereof).



(xii) All interests in Chateau OP and in each Chateau Subsidiary which is a
partnership, joint venture or limited liability company were issued in a
transaction or transactions that were not required to be registered under the
Securities Act (as defined herein).



 

-17- (xiii) The representations specified in this Section 2.1(k) are subject, as
of the date hereof (but not as of the Closing Date), to the matters set forth
in Section 2.1(k)(xiii) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter.



(l) _ERISA; Pension and Benefit Plans_.



(i) All "employee pension benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(2) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "),
maintained or contributed to by Chateau or any of the Chateau Subsidiaries or

forth in the Partner Solicitation Materials. Chateau shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other parties
hereto, to respond promptly to any comments made by any Governmental Entity,
if any, with respect to the Partner Solicitation Materials and any preliminary
version thereof filed by it and cause such Partner Solicitation Materials to
be mailed to OP Unit Holders at the earliest practicable time. Subject to
Sections 4.6 and 6.1, Chateau shall include in the Partner Solicitation
Materials the unanimous recommendations of the Chateau and ROC Board of
Directors that OP Unit Holders vote in favor of the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and the Partnership Merger, and other transactions contemplated
hereby.



(b) Subject to Sections 4.6 and 6.1, Chateau and ROC shall seek the written
consents and approvals of the OP Unit Holders and Series A Unit Holders to
the Chateau Partner Approval and recommend to the OP Unit Holders approval of
such matters, and include such recommendation in the Partner Solicitation
Materials.



(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall prepare a form of election in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Chateau and Chateau OP (the " _Form of Election_ "),
pursuant to which each Eligible OP Unit Holder (as defined below) will specify
(an " _Election_ ") (A) the number of OP Units (which must equal or exceed
5,500 OP Units, or 3,500 OP Units, as applicable) which it desires to have
converted into the right to receive the Partnership Security and (B) the
number of OP Units which it desires to have converted into the right to
receive cash in the Partnership Merger. In order to be eligible to elect to
receive the Partnership Security in the Partnership Merger, an OP Unit Holder
must, in Parents reasonable judgment: qualify as an "accredited investor"
under the Securities Act; _provided, however_ , that if in Purchasers
reasonable judgment (after being advised by outside counsel), based on
Purchasers (and such counsels) review of such OP Unit Holders responses to
the Form of Election and such other customary matters as are reasonably taken
into account by Parent and its counsel, such OP Unit Holder would not be
eligible as a result of any action or inaction taken by



 

-35- such OP Unit Holder or any of its affiliates or Representatives, or as a
result of the status or attributes of such OP Unit Holder or any of its
affiliates or Representatives, to continue as a limited partner of the
Surviving Partnership in accordance with this Agreement without registration
of such holders OP Units or the offer or sale of Partnership Securities to
such holder under applicable securities Laws or state securities or blue sky
laws, such OP Unit Holder shall have no right to make an Election hereunder,
and _provided further_ that in no event shall any such holder of OP Units
have a right to make an Election hereunder if the effect of issuing
Partnership Securities to such holder would be to result in the issuance of
Partnership Securities to more than 98 partners for purposes of Treasury
Regulation 1.7704-1(h) (it being understood and agreed that for purposes of
this limitation, holders of OP Units seeking to make an Election shall be
evaluated and disallowed from making such an Election based upon the number of
OP Units held by such holders, with the holder of the smallest number of OP
Units being excluded first, and then the holder of the second smallest number
of OP Units, and so forth until the condition in this proviso has been
satisfied). Any determinations made by Parent pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 4.2(c) shall be made by Parent only after being advised by
outside counsel and taking into account any opinion of counsel from Clifford
Chance US LLP or any counsel to any of the OP Unit Holder(s) who have
submitted a Form of Election, and only after allowing the relevant OP Unit
Holder(s) an opportunity to amend, correct or cure any matter arising in
connection the Election or the Form of Election. For purposes hereof "
_Eligible OP Unit Holder_ " means (x) an OP Unit Holder beneficially owning
and electing to convert at least 5,500 OP Units, or (y) any group of
affiliated OP Unit Holders beneficially owning and electing to convert at
least 5,500 OP Units in the aggregate, and who arrange that that all of such
OP Units and the Partnership Securities to be received in respect thereof in
accordance herewith will be owned and held within one newly formed entity
which will become a single limited partner of the Surviving Partnership
(any such entity, a " _Participating OP Holder Vehicle_ " ), or (z) any group
of unaffiliated OP Unit Holders beneficially owning and electing to convert at
least 3,500 OP Units individually, and who arrange that that all of such OP
Units and the Partnership Securities to be received in respect thereof in
accordance herewith will be owned and held within a Participating OP Holder
Vehicle, and provided that there shall be only one such Participating OP
Holder Vehicle permitted to participate pursuant to this clause (z).



(d) The Partnership Security shall have the terms set forth on _Exhibit C_
hereto (the " _Partnership Security Terms_ "), reasonably acceptable to Parent
and Chateau. Any OP Unit Holder electing option (A) as provided in Section
4.2(c) must also agree to become a party to the Limited Partnership Agreement
of the Surviving Partnership and, at its election, may become a party to the
Tax Protection Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
E_ (the " _Tax Protection Agreement_ "). Chateau shall have the right to
complete Schedule 1 to the Tax Protection Agreement and to allocate up to
$200,000,000 of Protected Amounts (as defined in the Tax Protection Agreement)
to the Contributing OP Unit Holders, and to complete Schedules 2(a) and 2(b)
to the Tax Protection Agreement to allocate the "Aggregate 704(c) Amount"
(which may not exceed $97,000,000) with respect to the properties identified
thereon and to the "Partners Share of 704(c) Amount" among the Continuing OP
Unitholders. Parent shall cause any Subsidiary of Parent identified on the
signature page of the Tax Protection Agreement to, and Chateau OP to, become a
party to the Tax Protection Agreement.



(e) Concurrently with the mailing of the Proxy Statement to Chateau
stockholders, Parent shall mail Forms of Election to OP Unit Holders, together
with the Partner Solicitation Materials. An election to subscribe for the
Partnership Securities shall be effective only if a properly executed Form of
Election is received by Parent prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on
the second business day preceding the Chateau Stockholder Meeting. If an OP
Unit Holder fails to return a duly completed Form of Election within the time
period specified above and does not duly perfect its appraisal rights pursuant
to the MRULPA, such OP Unit Holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive
cash upon the conversion of its OP Units in the Partnership Merger. Parent
and Chateau by mutual agreement shall have the right to make rules, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity



 

-36- of Forms of Election and the issuance and delivery of Partnership Securities
in the Partnership Merger. Parent shall, in its reasonable discretion,
determine whether a Form of Election has been properly completed, signed and
submitted or revoked.



(f) Purchaser covenants and agrees that, concurrently with the Closing, it
will cause the Surviving Partnership to enter into, with each OP Unit Holder
who validly elects to receive Partnership Securities in the Partnership
Merger, the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Surviving Partnership,
and will reasonably cooperate with such OP Unit Holders so that such OP Unit
Holders become members of Purchaser and enjoy the full rights and benefits of
the Partnership Securities.



(g) In the event Purchaser, directly or indirectly, desires to make one or
more tender offers or consent solicitations with respect to any or all of the
outstanding Indebtedness of Chateau or any of the Chateau Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Debt Offer_ "), Chateau and each Chateau Subsidiary
shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in the preparation of such offer
or consent solicitation and forms of the related letter of transmittal and
summary advertisement, as well as all other solicitations, information and
exhibits (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ "), and shall otherwise
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in connection with the Debt Offer. Each
of Purchaser and Chateau and each Chateau Subsidiary agrees promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Debt Offer Documents if
and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect.



(h) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 4.2, and intend that the offer of the
Partnership Security shall be conducted as a private placement, exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act.



Section 4.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Chateau shall, and shall
cause each of the Chateau Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives, reasonable access upon reasonable prior notice and
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to
all its properties (including for the purpose of conducting Phase I
environmental assessments and such other environmental testing as shall be
deemed desirable by Purchaser or its mortgage lender), books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, Chateau shall, and
shall cause each of the Chateau Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent
(a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. No
investigation under this Section 4.3 or otherwise shall affect any of
Chateaus representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or any
condition to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. Each of
Chateau and Parent will hold, and will cause its respective officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, and will comply with the provisions of
the letter agreement between Chateau and Purchaser dated as of April 22, 2003
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").



Section 4.4 _Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent and Chateau agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions
applicable to such party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, the
Partnership Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of
all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary or desirable to obtain an approval, waiver or
exemption from any



 

-37- Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals,
waivers or exemption from non-governmental third parties; and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary or desirable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. In addition, each of Parent and Chateau agrees
to use their reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order, injunction,
or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purpose of this Agreement, the proper
officers and directors of Chateau and Purchaser shall take all such necessary
action. From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Chateau
shall timely file, or cause to be filed, with the SEC all Chateau SEC
Documents required to be so filed. Chateau shall take all necessary actions
to make Affiliates of Purchaser the managing member or managing members, or
general partner or general partners, as the case may be, of the Surviving
Company and the Surviving Partnership.



Section 4.5 _Tax Treatment_.



(a) _Purchase Price Allocation_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, with the consent of Chateau and Chateau OP (each such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), reach agreement as to the manner in which the
consideration to be paid pursuant to this agreement, together with
any assumed liabilities (the " _Allocable Consideration_ ") shall be
allocated among the assets of Chateau and Chateau OP. Such allocation shall be
made in the manner required by Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder. In making such allocation the fair market values as
reasonably determined by the parties shall apply. Chateau, Chateau OP and
Purchaser hereby agree that IRS Form 8594 will be timely filed based on such
fair market values, except as may be required by a Determination.



(b) _Tax Treatment of the Merger_. Except as may be required by a
Determination, the parties shall treat the Merger for all income tax purposes
as a taxable purchase of assets by Purchaser in exchange for the allocable
Merger Consideration for all income tax purposes, and a liquidating
distribution of the Common Stock Merger Consideration to the shareholders of
Chateau within the meaning of Section 562(b)(1) of the Code, including filing
Chateau final Tax Returns consistent with such treatment, and no party shall
take any position inconsistent with such treatment.



(c) _Tax Treatment of the Partnership Merger_. Except as may be required by a
Determination, the parties shall treat the Partnership Merger, for all income
tax purposes as (i) a sale by the Selling OP Unit Holders of their OP Units
in Chateau OP to Purchaser in exchange for cash (and ii) for Continuing OP
Unit Holders a tax-deferred exchange of their former partnership interest in
Chateau OP for Partnership Securities, including filing Chateau OP Tax
Returns consistent with such treatment, and no party shall take any position
inconsistent with such treatment. For Continuing OP Unit Holders, the
Partnership Merger shall be treated as a tax-deferred contribution of the OP
Units in exchange for partnership securities under Section 721 of the Code.



(d)  _Consistency Required_. Neither Purchaser nor Chateau will take (or
permit its Affiliates to take) any action following the Closing that is
inconsistent with Chateaus status as a REIT for any period, except as may be
required by a Determination.



 

-38- Section 4.6 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.



(a) Subject to Section 6.1, during the term of this Agreement, Chateau shall
not, and shall not authorize or permit, directly or indirectly, any officer,
director, employee, agent, investment banker, financial advisor, consultant,
attorney, accountant, broker, finder or other representative (each, a "
_Representative_ ") of Chateau or any of its Affiliates to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or facilitate (including by way
of furnishing or disclosing nonpublic information or furnishing assistance)
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or other action that constitutes,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, or with respect to, any Competing
Transaction (as defined herein), (ii) explore, enter into, maintain, or
continue discussions or otherwise negotiate with any Person (other than
Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates or their respective Affiliates
Representatives) in furtherance of such inquiries, proposal or action, or to
obtain or otherwise with respect to a Competing Transaction, or (iii) enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring or causing Chateau
or any of its Affiliates to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.



(b) Subject to Section 6.1, Chateau Board of Directors shall not (i) withdraw
or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Purchaser,
its recommendations in favor of the Mergers, or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Competing Transaction.



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Competing Transaction_ " shall mean
any inquiry, offer or proposal regarding any of the following (other than the
transactions expressly provided for in this Agreement) involving Chateau or
any Chateau Subsidiary: (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination, reclassification, or other similar
transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition of 50% or more of the assets of Chateau and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 50% or more of the
outstanding shares of Chateau or the filing of a registration statement under
the Securities Act in connection therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of
a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to
engage in any of the foregoing.



Section 4.7 _Public Announcements_. Chateau and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing, or permitting their respective Affiliates to issue,
any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange if it has used its reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent
but has been unable to do so in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties
shall make a joint public announcement (the form and substance of which
Chateau and Parent shall mutually agree to in advance) of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents no later than (i) the
close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the day this Agreement is
signed, if such signing occurs during a business day or (ii) the opening of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day following the date
on which this Agreement is signed, if such signing does not occur during a
business day.



Section 4.8 _Transfer and Gains Taxes_. Purchaser shall, with Chateaus good
faith, cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file, or cause to be
prepared, executed and filed, all returns, questionnaires, applications or
other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes which
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated



 

-39- by this Agreement (together, with any related interests, penalties or
additions to Tax, " _Transfer and Gains Taxes_ "). From and after the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and Gains
Taxes without deductions withheld from any amounts payable to the holders of
the shares of Chateau Commons Stock or the OP Units.



Section 4.9 _Employee Arrangements_. 



(a) _Chateau Severance Agreements_. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall honor, and shall cause the Purchaser Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with their terms all Chateau Severance Agreements. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser expressly agrees that the Merger
shall constitute a change of control under the Chateau Severance Agreements
listed in Section 4.9(a) of the Chateau Disclosure Letter. In addition,
Purchaser expressly agrees that in the event that any Person who is party to
a Chateau Severance Agreement listed on Section 4.9(a) of the Chateau
Disclosure Letter is offered continued employment with Purchaser and its
affiliates after the Closing and such Person accepts such continued
employment, Purchaser shall pay to such Person, in equal monthly installments
over a four-month period following the Closing Date, the aggregate benefits to
which such Person would be entitled to receive under his or her respective
Chateau Severance Agreement following a Termination in connection with a
change of control (as defined therein a " _Termination Event_ "), in
satisfaction of such Persons rights and benefits under such Chateau Severance
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that if, following the Closing Date and prior
to the expiration of the four-month period after the Closing Date, the
employment of such Person with Purchaser is terminated by Purchaser, Purchaser
shall pay to such Person on the date of such termination of employment all of
the remaining installment payments due to such Person under such Chateau
Severance Agreement.



(b) _Benefit Plans_. Upon and after the Effective Time, for a period of no
less than two years, Purchaser (or its successors or assigns) shall provide
benefits to the employees of Chateau that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to such employees of Chateau than those provided to other similarly
situated employees of Purchaser at any applicable time after the termination
of the benefits provided to such employees of Chateau and the
Chateau Subsidiaries. With respect to any benefit plan of Purchaser which is
an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other
service based benefits (including vacations) in which the employees of Chateau
may participate, (A) solely for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits but not for purposes of
accrual of benefits (except in the case of accrued vacation, sick or personal
time), service with Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary shall be treated as
service with Purchaser; _provided, however,_ that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits under both a Chateau Employee Benefit Plan and a benefit plan of
Purchaser (or is not otherwise recognized for such purposes under the benefit
plans of Purchaser) and (B) Purchaser shall credit the amount of any
copayments and deductibles incurred by such employee under any such similar
plan during the calendar year prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall not treat any Chateau
employee as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health
or similar plan of Purchaser for a pre-existing medical condition, and will
make appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such
result. As of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall make, or cause Chateau to
make, all employer matching (whether or not otherwise discretionary) and
profit sharing contributions (whether or not otherwise discretionary) accrued
as of the Effective Time by Chateau to its 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan with
respect to compensation earned by participants prior to and through the
Effective Time, and any conditions to the making of such contributions
requiring continued service after the Effective Time shall be waived;
provided, that the amount required to be so contributed as employer matching
contributions shall not exceed (i) $347,000 times (ii) the Fraction (as
defined in the next sentence); and provided, further, that the amount required
to be so contributed as profit sharing contributions shall not exceed (i)
$514,000 times (ii) the Fraction. For these purposes, the Fraction means



 

-40- (A) the number of days from January 1, 2003 through the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, inclusive, divided by (B) 365.



Section 4.10  _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation
in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Claim_ "), a
director or officer of Chateau (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or
is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that he is or was a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of Chateau, or is or was
serving at the request of Chateau as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise. It is understood and agreed that Chateau shall indemnify and hold
harmless, and after the Effective Time the Surviving Company, the Surviving
Partnership, Parent and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to
the full extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement (with Purchasers prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) in connection with any such threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any
such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), (A) Chateau, and the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership,
Parent and Purchaser after the Effective Time, shall promptly pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law,
subject to the provision by such Indemnified Party of such affirmation as may
be required under applicable Maryland law and of an undertaking to reimburse
the amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination
by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to such amounts, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain one counsel
satisfactory to them and reasonably approved by Purchaser, and Chateau, and
the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership, Parent and Purchaser after
the Effective Time, shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Parties within 30 days after statements therefor are
received (and no other fees and expenses of counsel shall be payable or
reimbursable pursuant to this Section), and (C) Chateau, the Surviving Company
and Purchaser will use their respective reasonable best efforts to assist in
the vigorous defense of any such matter;  _provided, however_ , that the
Surviving Company and Purchaser shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 4.10, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
promptly Chateau and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and
Purchaser, thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so promptly notify shall
not affect the obligations of Chateau, the Surviving Company and Purchaser
except and only to the extent such failure to so promptly notify prejudices
such party.



(b) Purchaser and the Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification
existing in favor of, and all limitations of the personal liability of, the
directors, officers, employees and agents of Chateau and the Chateau
Subsidiaries provided for in the Chateau Charter or Chateau By-laws as in
effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, including the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time; _provided,
however,_ that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claims asserted
or made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such
Claim. Prior to the Effective Time, Chateau shall purchase an extended
reporting period endorsement under Chateaus existing directors and officers
liability



 

-41- insurance coverage for Chateaus directors and officers, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Chateau which shall provide such directors and officers with
coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable on
the whole to, the insured persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance coverage presently maintained by Chateau; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Purchaser or its affiliates be required to expend more
than an aggregate amount equal to 500% of the most recent annual premium paid
by Chateau (which amount under the current policy is set forth in Section 4.10
of the Chateau Disclosure Letter), whether expended over time or paid in a
lump sum or otherwise, to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to
this Section 4.10; and, _provided_ , _further_ that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Purchaser shall be obligated to
obtain or to cause to be obtained a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount.



(c) This Section 4.10 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Purchaser, Chateau and the Surviving Company. Each
of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 4.10.



(d) In the event that Purchaser or the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
or entity and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person or entity, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Purchaser and the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 4.10.



Section 4.11 _Assistance_. From and after the date of this Agreement, if
Purchaser requests, Chateau and the Chateau Subsidiaries shall cooperate, and
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Chateaus attorneys,
accountants and other representatives to cooperate, in all reasonable respects
in connection with any financing efforts (including the refinancing or
assumption of existing Indebtedness) of Purchaser or its Affiliates (including
providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of one or more offering
circulars, private placement memoranda, registration statements or other
offering documents relating to debt or equity financing) and any other filings
that may be made by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including, if applicable,
with the SEC, all at the sole expense of Purchaser (or its Affiliates).
Chateau shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and the Merger Sub and the
Partnership Merger Sub in obtaining surveys, title commitments or policies,
engineering reports, estoppel certificates, environmental reports and
appraisals with respect to the Chateau Properties and in otherwise satisfying
any of Purchasers mortgage lenders requirements (it being understood that
such activities shall be conducted at Purchasers expense) or the requirements
of any of Chateau or Chateau Subsidiaries existing mortgage lenders.



Section 4.12 _Proxy Solicitor_. Chateau shall engage D.F. King as its proxy
solicitor to assist in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders relating
to the Chateau Stockholder Approval and the approval of the OP Unit Holders
in connection with the Chateau Partner Approval.



Section 4.13 _Resignations_. Upon the written request of Purchaser, (i)
Chateau shall cause any or all of the directors (or persons occupying similar
positions in any limited liability company or other entity) and/or officers
of Chateau and each Chateau Subsidiary to resign or be removed or, as to
officers, to resign or be terminated, effective as of the Closing.



Section 4.14 _Information Supplied_. None of Chateau, Chateau OP, Parent or
Purchaser shall supply information for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement that will, at the date mailed to Chateau
stockholders, at the time of the Chateau Stockholder Meeting or at the
Effective Time,



 

-42- contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. None of Chateau, Chateau OP, Parent or Purchaser shall supply
information for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Partner
Solicitation Materials that will, at the date mailed to OP Unit Holders or at
the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event
with respect to Chateau or Chateau OP or the other Chateau Subsidiaries, or
with respect to other information supplied by Chateau or Chateau OP for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Partner Solicitation Materials, as the
case may be, shall occur which is required to be described in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Partner Solicitation
Materials, Chateau or Chateau OP, as the case may be, shall so describe such
event, and shall promptly file such amendment or supplement (if required to be
filed) with the SEC.



Section 4.15 _ROC Restructuring_. Prior to the Merger and as a condition to
its consummation, Chateau shall cause ROC to merge with and into Chateau with
Chateau being the surviving company in such merger, and the sole merger
consideration in such merger received by the stockholders of ROC shall be
Chateau Common Stock. The maximum aggregate amount of Chateau Common Stock to
be issued in such merger (other than Chateau Common Stock issued to Chateau,
which Chateau Common Stock so issued to Chateau shall be cancelled in such
merger for no consideration) shall be no more than 1,000 shares of Chateau
Common Stock.

except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be in the
aggregate true and correct (without giving effect to any Purchaser
Materiality Qualifier) would not or would not reasonably be likely to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and Chateau shall have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Purchaser by a duly authorized representative
of Purchaser, in such capacity, to such effect.



(b) _Performance of Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent, Purchaser, Merger Sub
and Partnership Merger Sub shall have performed or complied with all

-45- ARTICLE VI 



BOARD ACTIONS



Section 6.1 _Board Actions_. Notwithstanding Section 4.6 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Effective Time:



(a) In the event that after the date hereof, Chateau or any Representative of
Chateau or any of its Affiliates receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
inquiry or proposal from a third party with respect to a Competing
Transaction, Chateau shall notify Purchaser orally and in writing (as promptly
as practicable but in any event within 24 hours) of all of the relevant
details relating thereto (including the identity of the parties, price and
other terms thereof), including any modification, amendment or change in
respect thereto, including relating to a Competing Transaction, and shall
promptly furnish to Purchaser in writing a copy of any inquiry or proposal in
addition to any information provided to or by any third party relating
thereto. Chateau may furnish information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, such third party if, and only to the extent that, (A) the
Board of Directors of Chateau after consultation with and having considered
the advice of independent legal counsel, determines in good faith that (x)
such Competing Transaction would, if consummated, constitute a Superior
Competing Transaction (as defined herein), and (y) such action is necessary
for the directors of Chateau to comply with their legal duties to Chateaus
stockholders and OP Unitholders under applicable Law and (B) prior to taking
such action, Chateau (x) provides reasonable notice to Purchaser (but in
any event no later than 36 hours before taking such action) to the effect
that it is taking such action and (y) receives from such third party an
executed confidentiality or standstill agreement in reasonably customary form,
the terms of which, as applicable to such third party, in any event are at
least as stringent as those applicable to Purchaser in the Confidentiality
Agreement. Before providing any information to or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any third party in connection with a Competing Transaction
by such third party to the extent permitted pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, Chateau shall notify Purchaser of any Competing
Transaction (including the material terms and conditions thereof and the
identity of the person making it) as promptly as practicable after its receipt
thereof (and in any event, no later than 24 hours from receipt), and shall
provide Purchaser with a copy of any written Competing Transaction or
amendments or supplements thereto, and shall thereafter promptly inform
Purchaser of the status of any discussions or negotiations with such a third
party, and any material changes to the terms and conditions of such Competing
Transaction, and shall promptly give Purchaser a copy of any information
delivered to such third party that has not previously been reviewed by
Purchaser. Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Chateau will, and will cause its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their
respective Representatives to, cease and terminate any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any possible Competing Transaction. Chateau agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section
6.1(a). Chateau shall keep Purchaser fully apprised of the status (including
amendments and proposed amendments) of any proposal relating to a Competing
Transaction on a current basis, including promptly providing to Purchaser
copies of any written communications between Chateau and any Person relating
to a Competing Transaction.



(b) Notwithstanding Section 4.6 or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, but subject to this Section 6.1(b), the Board of Directors of
Chateau may, provided that it gives Purchaser five full business days prior
written notice of its intention to do so, withdraw or modify, or propose
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Purchaser, its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Mergers, may approve or recommend a
Competing Transaction (or amendment or supplement thereto), or cause Chateau
or Chateau OP to enter into an agreement with respect thereto, if and only to
the extent that, the Board of Directors of Chateau, after consultation with
and having considered the advice of independent legal counsel and an
investment bank of nationally recognized reputation,



 

-46- determines in good faith (after taking into account any proposal that may have
been made by Purchaser at such time) that (x) a _bona fide_ written proposal
from a third party for a Competing Transaction received after the date hereof
that was not, directly or indirectly, initiated, solicited or encouraged or
knowingly facilitated by Chateau or any Chateau Subsidiary or their
respective Representatives is more favorable to the stockholders of Chateau
and the holders of the OP Units than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and is reasonably capable of being consummated, and (y) such
action is necessary for the directors of Chateau to comply with their legal
duties to the Chateau stockholders and OP Unitholders under applicable Law (a
" _Superior Competing Transaction_ "). Any such withdrawal or modification
of the recommendation shall not change the approval of the Chateau Board of
Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute or other state Law to
be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this
Section 6.1(b), a Competing Transaction shall exclude any financing or
refinancing transaction.



(c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 shall prohibit Chateau from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the
Chateau stockholders which, in the good faith reasonable judgment of the Board
of Directors of Chateau, based on the advice of independent legal counsel, is
required under applicable Law.



ARTICLE VII



TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER



Section 7.1 _Termination_. Subject to Section 7.2, this Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the
Department, whether before or after the Chateau Stockholder Approval is

Purchaser and the Board of Directors of Purchaser and Chateau;



(b) by Purchaser, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Chateau, Chateau OP or ROC set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Chateau shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a)
or (b), as the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by December
31, 2003 (as otherwise extended by mutual written agreement by Chateau and
Purchaser, the " _Outside Date_ ");



(c) by Chateau, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of Parent or Purchaser, shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 5.3(a) or
(b), as the case may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside
Date;



(d) by either Purchaser or Chateau, if any judgment, injunction, order, decree
or action by any Governmental Entity of competent authority preventing the
consummation of the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable;



(e) by either Purchaser or Chateau, if the Mergers shall not have been
consummated before the Outside Date; _provided, however,_ that a party that
has materially breached a representation, warranty or covenant of such party
set forth in this Agreement and not cured such breach by the Outside Date
shall not be entitled to exercise its right to terminate under this Section
7.1(e);



 

-47- (f) by Purchaser if, upon a vote at a duly held Chateau Stockholder Meeting,
the Chateau Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained, as contemplated
by Section 4.1(a), or if the Chateau Partner Approval shall not have been
obtained, as contemplated by Section 4.2;



(g) by Chateau, if the Board of Directors of Chateau shall have otherwise
fully complied with the terms of this Agreement, including pursuant to Section
6.1, but shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified in any manner adverse to
Purchaser its approval or recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement in
connection with, or approved or recommended, a Superior Competing Transaction;
or



(h) by Purchaser, if (i) prior to the approval of this Agreement at the

withdrawn or modified in any manner adverse to Purchaser its approval or
recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement in connection with, or approved
or recommended, any Competing Transaction, (ii) Chateau or Chateau OP shall
have entered into any agreement with respect to any Competing Transaction, or
(iii) the Board of Directors of Chateau shall have resolved to do any of the
foregoing.



A terminating party shall provide written notice of termination to the other
parties specifying with particularity the reason for such termination. If
more than one provision in this Section 7.1 is available to a terminating
party in connection with a termination, a terminating party may rely on any
and all available provisions in this Section 7.1 for any such termination.



Section 7.2  _Expenses_.



(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Section 7.2 or agreed in writing by
the parties, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.



(b) Chateau agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(f) (and in the case of any such termination, Purchaser
has not materially breached its representations and warranties or covenants
(or has cured any such breach prior to the date of the Chateau Stockholder
Meeting)), then Chateau will pay to Purchaser, or as directed by Purchaser, an
amount equal to the Purchaser Break-Up Expenses (as defined herein). Chateau
also agrees that if this Agreement (i) is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(f) (and in the case of any such termination, Purchaser has not
materially breached its representations and warranties or covenants (or has
cured any such breach prior to the date of the Chateau Stockholder Meeting))
and within one year of any such termination Chateau or Chateau OP shall
consummate a Competing Transaction or execute a definitive agreement providing
for a Competing Transaction (but excluding for this purpose a Competing
Transaction that is a financing or refinancing), (ii) is terminated pursuant
to Section 7.1(g) or (h), or (iii) is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(e)
and within one year of any such termination Chateau or Chateau OP shall
consummate a Competing Transaction or execute a definitive agreement
providing for a Competing Transaction (but excluding for this purpose a
Competing Transaction that is a financing or refinancing), then, Chateau shall
pay to Purchaser, or as directed by Purchaser, an amount equal to the
Purchaser Break-Up Fee (as defined herein) and, if not previously paid, the
Purchaser Break-Up Expenses. Payment of any of such amounts shall be made, as
directed by Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
promptly, but in no event later than two business days after the amount is
due as provided herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Purchaser
Break-Up Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to $40,000,000. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Purchaser Break-Up Expenses_ " shall be an amount equal to
Purchasers out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including all fees and
expenses of attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, experts, financing
sources and other advisors and consultants) but in no event in an amount
greater than $15,000,000. Payment of any of such amounts shall be made, as
directed by Purchaser, by wire transfer



 

-48- of immediately available funds promptly, but in no event later than two
business days after the amount is due as provided herein, or, in the event of
any termination by Chateau, simultaneously with and as a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination.



(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c), then
Purchaser thereupon shall be liable to pay to Chateau an amount equal to the
Chateau Break-Up Expenses. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Chateau
Break-Up Expenses_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) Chateaus
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including all fees and expenses of
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, experts, financing sources and
other advisors and consultants) but in no event in an amount greater than
$5,000,000 (such amount being referred to in this Section 7.2(c) as the "
_Chateau Expense Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount
that can be paid to Chateau without causing it to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ "), as determined by independent accountants to Chateau and (B) in the
event Chateau receives a Chateau Break-Up Tax Opinion indicating that either
(x) Chateaus receipt of the Chateau Expense Base Amount would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from Chateaus gross income
for purposes of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT
Requirements_ ") or that receipt by Chateau of the remaining balance of the
Chateau Expense Base Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such
ruling would not be deemed constructively received prior thereto or (y) in
outside counsels opinion the receipt by Chateau of the Chateau Expense Base
Amount should not cause Chateau to fail to qualify as a REIT, the Chateau
Expense Base Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. In the
event that Chateau is not able to receive the full Chateau Expense Base
Amount, Purchaser shall place the unpaid amount ( _i.e._ , the difference
between the Chateau Expense Base Amount and the Chateau Break-Up Expenses) in
escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to Chateau unless and until
Purchaser receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter(s)
from Chateaus outside counsel or independent accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Chateau without causing
Chateau to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year,
together with an IRS ruling or opinion of tax counsel to the effect that such
payment would not be treated as included in income for any prior taxable
year, in which event such maximum amount shall be paid to Chateau, or (ii) a
Chateau Break-Up Tax Opinion indicating that either Chateaus receipt of the
Chateau Expense Base Amount would satisfy, in whole or in part, the
REIT Requirements or Chateaus receipt of the Chateau Expense Base Amount
should not cause Chateau to fail to qualify as a REIT, in which event
Purchaser shall pay to Chateau the unpaid Chateau Expense Base Amount or the
maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above. Purchasers
obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the Chateau Break-Up Expenses
(provided Purchaser has otherwise complied with its obligations under this
provision) shall terminate (and any amount still held in such escrow shall be
released to Purchaser) on the date that is five years from the date the
Chateau Break-Up Expenses first become due under this Agreement.



(d) The foregoing provisions of this Section 7.2 have been agreed to by each
of the parties hereto in order to induce the other parties to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, it being agreed and acknowledged by each of
them that the execution of this Agreement by them constitutes full and
reasonable consideration for such provisions.



(e) In the event that either Purchaser or Chateau is required to file suit to
seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this Section 7.2, and such
party prevails in such litigation, such party shall be entitled to all
expenses, including attorneys fees and expenses, which it has incurred in
enforcing its rights under this Section 7.2.



 

-49- Section 7.3  _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Chateau or Purchaser as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser or Chateau, other than the
last sentence of Section 4.3, Section 7.2, this Section 7.3 and Article VIII
and except to the extent that such termination results from a willful breach
by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement or a failure or refusal by such party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby when such party was obligated
to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.



Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time before
or after the Chateau Stockholder Approval is obtained and prior to the filing
of the Articles of Merger for the Merger with the Department; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, after the Chateau Stockholder Approval is obtained, no such
amendment, modification or supplement shall alter the amount or change the
form of the Merger Consideration to be delivered to Chateaus stockholders or
alter or change any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if such
alteration or change would adversely affect Chateaus stockholders.



Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
of Chateau and Purchaser may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) subject to the provisions of Section 7.4, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.
