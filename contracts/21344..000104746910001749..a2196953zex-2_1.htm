ARTICLE II

  

_THE TRANSACTIONS; CLOSING_

  

 2.1 _ _ _The Transactions._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties shall cause the Merger and Separation Transactions to be consummated as set forth below. The parties hereto intend that none of the Merger or the Separation Transactions shall become effective unless all of such transactions become effective. 

  

  

 (a) _Separation Transactions._ As more fully described in _Schedule A_ attached hereto, prior to the Effective Time, and subject to _Article III_ hereof, (i) CCE shall to the extent necessary cause all of the equity interests in the Other CCE Businesses Entities directly or indirectly to be owned by Splitco, (ii) CCE and Splitco shall take, or cause to be taken, all necessary actions such that (A) CCE will hold, directly or indirectly, all right, title and interest to the equity interests of each of the other North American Business Entities free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens arising out of pledges of the equity interests of any of the North American Business Subsidiaries pursuant to the Credit Agreement or to the extent arising out of any North American Joint Venture Contract) and Splitco will hold, directly or indirectly, all right, title and interest to the equity interests of each of the Other CCE Businesses Entities, free and clear of all Liens, (B) (1) CCE or one of the North American Business Subsidiaries shall own all of the North American Business Assets free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens and be liable for the North American Business Liabilities and (2) Splitco or one of the Other CCE Businesses Entities shall own all of the Other CCE Businesses Assets and be liable for the Other CCE Businesses Liabilities, (iii) CCE shall take, or cause to be taken, all necessary actions to transfer to Splitco the Excluded Business Assets and Excluded Current Assets and (iv) TCCC shall take, or cause to be taken, all necessary actions to effect all the payments to Splitco that TCCC is required to make pursuant to _Schedule A_. In furtherance of the foregoing, CCE and Splitco shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all necessary action such that following the Effective Time, CCE shall not have any direct or indirect ownership interest in Splitco or the Other CCE Businesses Entities and Splitco and the Other CCE Businesses Entities shall not have any direct or indirect ownership interest in the North American Business Entities. CCE and Splitco and, as applicable, TCCC, shall cause the 

  

      

  

Separation Transactions to be completed in compliance with the steps, and in
the order, specifically described on _Schedule A_ or as otherwise consented
to by the other party in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided_ that any such deviation from 
_Schedule A_ does not adversely affect, in any material respect, such party
or its Subsidiaries (including, in the case of TCCC, the North American
Business Entities), or the benefits expected to be derived by such party as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements (collectively, the " _Transactions_ "). If the applicable parties
consent to a deviation from _Schedule A_ in accordance with this  _Section
2.1(a)_ (in which case, the parties shall cause _Schedule A_ to be revised
accordingly), then for purposes of this Agreement, all references to
_Schedule A_ shall be deemed to be references to _Schedule A_ as so revised.

  

 (b) _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into CCE at the Effective Time of the Merger, with CCE continuing as the Surviving Corporation, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. As the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, CCE shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub and CCE in accordance with Section 264 of the DGCL and Section 209 of the DLLCA. 

  

  

 2.2 _ _ _The Closing._ Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Separation Transactions and the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, N.Y. at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the first day of the Accounting Cycle (or if not a Business Day, the next Business Day) beginning after the date on which the conditions set forth in _qArticle VII_ hereof have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other time and place as TCCC and CCE may mutually agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). The parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause the Closing and the closing contemplated by the Nordic SPA to occur contemporaneously. 

  

 2.3 _ _ _Effective Time._ The Merger shall become effective when a certificate of merger evidencing the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other date and time as are agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger. When used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the later of the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later time established by the Certificate of Merger. The filing of the Certificate of Merger shall be made on the Closing Date. 

  

 2.4 _Effects of the Merger._

  

  

 (a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Interests._ At the Effective Time each Merger Sub Membership Interest shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Effect of Merger on CCE Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of CCE Common Stock, other than any (i) Cancelled Shares and (ii) shares of CCE Common Stock (and together with the Cancelled Shares, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 1.000 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") share of validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable Splitco Common Stock (such number of shares, the " _Stock Consideration_ "), and (ii) $10.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, each such share of CCE Common Stock shall be cancelled and each holder of shares of CCE Common Stock, other than any Excluded Shares, immediately 

  

      

  
  

prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such CCE Common Stock except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
this _Section 2.4(b)_. In no case shall CCE retain any shares of Splitco
Common Stock following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, all fractional shares of Splitco Common Stock that
a holder of shares of CCE Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive
as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share
results from such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in
lieu thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying
the closing price of a share of Splitco Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the trading day immediately following the day on which the
Effective Time occurs by the fraction of a share of Splitco Common Stock to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

   

 (c) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under _Section 2.5(h)_. 

  

 (d) _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation._ The certificate of incorporation in the form to be determined by Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. 

   

 (e) _By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation._ The by-laws in the form to be determined by Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. 

  

 (f) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation._ TCCC and Merger Sub shall take all necessary actions to appoint, effective as of the Effective Time, such directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation as TCCC and Merger Sub shall determine, and from and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, such directors and officers shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (g) _Effect on CCE Equity Awards._

    

 (i) Each option to purchase CCE Common Stock granted under a CCE shareholder-approved equity compensation plan (a " _CCE Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a CCE North American Employee or a former employee of the North American Business (other than Transferred CCE North American Employees, as defined in the Employee Matters Agreement) (a " _North American Business Holder_ ") shall be replaced as of the Effective Time with an option to purchase TCCC Common Stock (a " _TCCC Option_ "). The per share exercise price of each such TCCC Option shall be equal to the product (which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (A) the exercise price of such CCE Option immediately before the Effective Time and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the TCCC Stock Price and the denominator of which shall be the CCE Stock Price. The number of shares of TCCC Common Stock subject to each TCCC Option shall be equal to the product (which shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (A) the number of shares subject to the CCE Option as of the Effective Time and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the CCE Stock Price and the denominator of which shall be the TCCC Stock Price. All such TCCC Options shall be subject to terms, vesting conditions, and other conditions that are the same as were applicable to the CCE Options immediately prior to the Effective Time. The " _TCCC Stock Price_ " shall mean the closing price of TCCC Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the full trading day occurring on or immediately before the Closing Date. The " _CCE Stock Price_ " shall mean the closing price of CCE Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the full trading day occurring on or immediately before the Closing Date. 

   

    

   

   

                                    

  

   

 (ii) Each CCE Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not replaced pursuant to _Section 2.4(g)(i)_ shall be replaced as of the Effective Time with an option to purchase Splitco Common Stock (a " _Splitco Option_ "). The per share exercise price of each such Splitco Option shall be equal to the product (which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (A) the exercise price of such CCE Option immediately before the Effective Time and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Splitco Stock Price and the denominator of which shall be the CCE Stock Price. The number of shares of Splitco Common Stock subject to each Splitco Option shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares subject to the CCE Option as of the Effective Time (which shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the CCE Stock Price and the denominator of which shall be the Splitco Stock Price. All such Splitco Options shall be subject to terms, vesting conditions, and other conditions that are the same as were applicable to the CCE Options immediately prior to the Effective Time. The " _Splitco Stock Price_ " shall mean the closing price of Splitco Common Stock trading, on a "when issued" basis, if applicable, on the New York Stock Exchange on the full trading day occurring on or immediately before the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if as of the Closing Date there is no "when issued" closing price of Splitco Common Stock, Splitco shall identify a price for the Splitco Common Stock intended to achieve the same result. 

  

 (iii) Each CCE restricted or performance stock unit granted under a CCE shareholder-approved equity compensation plan (including each unit attributable to the deemed investment in CCE Common Stock under the Supplemental MESIP and deferred stock units under the CCE Deferred Stock Plan) (a " _CCE Stock Unit_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a North American Business Holder shall be replaced upon the Effective Time with a restricted or performance stock unit (or deemed investment) with respect to TCCC Common Stock (a " _TCCC Stock Unit_ "). The number of such TCCC Stock Units shall be equal to the product (which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (A) the number of CCE Stock Units as of the Effective Time and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the CCE Stock Price and the denominator of which is the TCCC Stock Price. All such TCCC Stock Units shall be subject to terms, vesting conditions, and other conditions that are the same as were applicable to the CCE Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, including an entitlement to the same value of cash dividend equivalents, whether accrued prior to or after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any vesting conditions of the CCE Stock Units that are based on attaining a particular stock price shall be adjusted to reflect the transactions contemplated hereby by multiplying the CCE stock price target by a fraction, the numerator of which is the TCCC Stock Price and the denominator of which is the CCE Stock Price, and any vesting conditions of the CCE Stock Units that are based on attaining a particular level of earnings per share shall be adjusted as provided in  _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Employee Matters Agreement. 

  

 (iv) Each CCE Stock Unit that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not replaced pursuant to  _Section 2.4(g)(iii)_ shall be replaced upon the Effective Time with a restricted or performance stock unit (or deemed investment) with respect to Splitco Common Stock (a " _Splitco Stock Unit_ "). The number of such Splitco Stock Units shall be equal to the product (which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (A) the number of CCE Stock Units as of the Effective Time and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the CCE Stock Price and the denominator of which is the Splitco Stock Price. All such Splitco Stock Units shall be subject to terms, vesting conditions, and other conditions that are the same as were applicable to the CCE Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, including an entitlement to the same value of cash dividend equivalents, whether accrued prior to or after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any 

   

      

   
  

vesting conditions of the CCE Stock Units that are based on attaining a
particular stock price or a particular level of earnings per share shall be
adjusted or waived as determined by Splitco in its sole discretion.

  

 (v) Each share of restricted CCE Common Stock granted under a CCE shareholder-approved equity compensation plan (" _CCE Restricted Stock_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a North American Business Holder shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and replaced with a share of restricted TCCC Common Stock (" _TCCC Restricted Stock_ "). The number of shares of such TCCC Restricted Stock shall be equal to the product (which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (A) the number of shares of CCE Restricted Stock as of the Effective Time and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the CCE Stock Price and the denominator of which is the TCCC Stock Price. All such shares of TCCC Restricted Stock shall be subject to terms, vesting conditions, and other conditions that are the same as were applicable to the CCE Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any vesting conditions of the CCE Restricted Stock that are based on attaining a particular stock price shall be adjusted to reflect the transactions contemplated hereby by multiplying the CCE stock price target by a fraction, the numerator of which is the TCCC Stock Price and the denominator of which is the CCE Stock Price. 

  

 (vi) Each share of CCE Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not replaced pursuant to  _Section 2.4(g)(v)_ shall be exchanged for a number of shares of Splitco Common Stock equal to the product (which shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share) of (A) the number of such shares of CCE Restricted Stock and (B) the Exchange Ratio. Holders of such shares of CCE Restricted Stock shall also receive a payment of Cash Consideration equal to the amount such holders would have received if they had held fully vested shares of CCE Restricted Stock. Such Splitco Common Stock (the " _Splitco Restricted Stock_ ") shall be subject to terms, vesting conditions, and other conditions that are the same as were applicable to the CCE Restricted Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any vesting conditions of the CCE Restricted Stock that are based on attaining a particular stock price shall be adjusted or waived as determined by Splitco in its sole discretion. If any such waiver results in the Splitco Restricted Stock being vested and subject to no further restrictions, then each affected holder shall hold fully vested Splitco Common Stock. 

  

 (vii) The parties shall cooperate to share appropriate information necessary to administer the awards referred to in this _Section 2.4(g)_, including information required for vesting and forfeiture of awards, Tax withholding, remittance, and reporting, compliance with trading windows, and compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws (including foreign Laws). The parties mutually agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain effective registration statements with the SEC with respect to the awards described in this _Section 2.4(g)_, to the extent any such registration statement is required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conversion of a CCE Option in accordance with the preceding provisions of this _Section 2.4(g)_ would cause the related TCCC Option or Splitco Option, as the case may be, to be treated as the grant of a new stock right for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, such CCE Option shall not be converted in accordance with the preceding provisions but shall instead be converted in a manner that would not cause the related TCCC Option or Splitco Option, as the case may be, to be treated as the grant of a new stock right for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.4(g)_, to the extent any of the provisions hereof do not conform with applicable foreign Laws, such provisions shall be 

   

      

   
  

modified to the extent necessary to conform with such foreign Laws, in such
manner as is equitable and to preserve the intent hereof, as determined by the
parties in good faith.

   

  

 2.5 _ _ _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, CCE and Splitco shall deposit (as applicable), with a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to TCCC and CCE (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to TCCC, CCE and Splitco, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of CCE Common Stock other than the Excluded Shares, (i) certificates representing shares of Splitco Common Stock sufficient to pay the Stock Consideration and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of CCE Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of CCE Common Stock (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated shares of CCE Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to this _Article II_. Following the Effective Time, Splitco shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, (x) cash in amounts that are sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_, (y) additional shares of Splitco Common Stock as are necessary to pay the Stock Consideration, and (z) additional cash as may be necessary to pay the Cash Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

    

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective Time, TCCC shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of CCE Common Stock whose shares of CCE Common Stock were converted into the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.4(b)_, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title thereto shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as agreed to by TCCC, CCE and Splitco) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required thereby or by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of CCE Common Stock held prior to the Effective Time represented by its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate that is not registered in the transfer records of CCE, the applicable Merger Consideration may be paid to the transferee thereof if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of CCE Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable share transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.5_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 2.4_, be deemed at any time after the Effective Time of the Merger to represent only the right to receive upon surrender the applicable Merger Consideration (without interest) as contemplated by this _Article II_. 

   

      

   

 (iii) The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of shares of CCE Common Stock such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any provision of United States state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. Amounts so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of CCE Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

    

 (c) _Closing of Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of CCE will be closed, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of CCE Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Splitco for transfer, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this _Article II_. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in CCE Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of CCE Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of CCE Common Stock on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time of the Merger will be delivered to Splitco upon demand, and any former holder of shares of CCE Common Stock who has not surrendered or transferred its Certificates in accordance with the applicable provisions of this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Splitco for payment of any claim for the Merger Consideration upon due surrender or transfer of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of CCE, Splitco, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, TCCC, the Exchange Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former holder of shares of CCE Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. Upon the making of an affidavit that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. 

  

 (h) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.4(b)_ hereof, no Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of CCE Common Stock owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Person\'s right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, net of any amount required to be withheld or deducted under any Tax Law, with respect to the shares of CCE Common Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. CCE shall give TCCC prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by CCE relating to stockholders\' rights of appraisal. Prior to the Effective Time, CCE shall not, except with the prior written consent of TCCC, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

obligation in accordance with the underlying obligation under any such
Guarantee (except to the extent the performance obligation under any such

applicable guarantor (rather than the underlying obligor)).

   

 (c) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, CCE and Splitco shall promptly deliver to TCCC a copy of any Guarantees arising after the date of this Agreement or otherwise not included on _Section 4.25(a)_ of the CCE Disclosure Letter or _Section 4.25(b)_ of the CCE Disclosure Letter, as applicable.

 (b) Prior to the Closing, CCE and Splitco shall take all necessary actions to cause Splitco and the Other CCE Businesses Entities to be removed, with respect to occurrences transpiring (under occurrence-based policies) or claims first made (with respect to claims made policies) subsequent to the Effective Time, as insureds under any Policy covering CCE and its North American Business Subsidiaries, _provided_ that no action shall be taken that is inconsistent with the rights of Splitco and the Other CCE Businesses Entities set forth in  _Section 3.8(c)_. Prior to the Closing, Splitco shall, on behalf of itself and the Other CCE Businesses Entities, procure such insurance coverage as determined by Splitco, in good faith, to be necessary or advisable in connection with the operation of the Other CCE Businesses, the cost of such coverage to be born solely by Splitco and the Other CCE Businesses Entities. Other than as provided in _Section 3.8(c)_, from and after the Closing, Splitco agrees that it shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) make any claim against TCCC, any of the North American Business Entities, or to any carrier under any Policy of CCE and its Subsidiaries alleging that Splitco, any of the Other CCE Businesses Entities or the Other CCE Businesses is entitled to coverage or reimbursement under any such Policy. 

  

 (c) Where Shared Policies with an unaffiliated third party insurer (and excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any self-insurance, captive insurance or similar program) cover any Other CCE Businesses Liabilities that (i) constitute claims existing prior to the Effective Time or (ii) relate to claims made after the Effective Time with respect to an occurrence prior to the Effective Time under an occurrence-based policy (collectively, " _Covered Claims_ "), then the Other CCE Businesses Entities may claim coverage under such Shared Policies, control the prosecution and defense of such Covered Claims and receive any insurance recoverables with respect thereto. After the Effective Time, CCE shall administer the Shared Policies, _provided_ that such administration shall in no way limit, inhibit or preclude the right of the Other CCE Businesses to insurance coverage thereunder in accordance with this _Section 3.8(c)_, in each case, with respect to Covered Claims. Splitco shall promptly notify CCE of any Covered Claims, and CCE agrees to cooperate with Splitco concerning the pursuit by Splitco of any such Covered Claim, in each case at the expense of Splitco (to the extent such expenses are not covered by the applicable Shared Policies). Splitco shall be responsible for complying with terms of the Shared Policies to obtain coverage for such Covered Claims, including if the Shared Policy requires any payments to be made in connection therewith, and Splitco shall make any such required payments. Any proceeds received by CCE from any third-party insurance carrier that relate to Covered Claims shall be paid promptly to Splitco. In the event that Covered Claims relate to the same occurrence for which CCE is seeking coverage under such Shared Policies, CCE and Splitco shall jointly defend any such claim of interest necessary to conduct a joint defense, and shall bear any expenses in connection therewith equally (to the extent such expenses are not covered by the applicable Shared Policies). In the event that policy limits under an applicable Policy are not sufficient to fund all Covered Claims of CCE, its North American Business Subsidiaries, Splitco and/or the Other CCE Businesses Entities, amounts due under such Policy shall be paid on a first come first served basis, and any amounts simultaneously due shall be paid to the respective entities in proportion to the amounts which otherwise would be due were the limits of liability infinite. 

  

 (d) With respect to any and all events or circumstances affecting the North American Business which could reasonably be the subject of a claim under a North American Business Policy or Shared Policy which are known prior to the Effective Time to the employees of CCE or its Subsidiaries who are responsible for making claims under Policies, CCE shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to submit the applicable claims (i) prior to the expiration of coverage under the applicable Policy or (ii) to the extent that the rights of any North American Business Entity to make claims pursuant to the applicable Policy in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be limited in any material respect following the Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the Policy as in effect prior to the Effective Time, prior to 

  

      

  
  

the Effective Time. The foregoing shall not in any way limit the rights of
Splitco and its Subsidiaries under _Section 3.8(c)_.

  

  

 3.9 _ _ _Liabilities Related to the Separation Transactions_. Other than Transaction Expenses which are covered by _Section 10.1_, any Liabilities that may arise in connection with or as a result of effecting the Separation Transactions, shall be allocated 50% to TCCC and 50% to Splitco.

 (i) CCE, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may (A) engage or participate in negotiations or discussions with any Person and its Representatives that, subject to CCE\'s compliance with _Section 6.5(a)_ has made after the date of this Agreement an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the CCE Board believes in good faith constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (B) furnish to such Person or its Representatives nonpublic information relating to CCE or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to TCCC) with such Person;  _provided_ , that all such information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to TCCC) is provided or made available to TCCC, as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Person; and

provide to TCCC copies of all correspondence and written materials sent or
provided to CCE or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any proposal or offer made by TCCC or any of its Affiliates, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to any transaction to effect, or any indication of interest by any third Person in, (i) any amalgamation, merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution spin-off, split off or similar transaction involving CCE or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated assets of CCE, or any purchase or sale of 15% or more of the consolidated assets (including stock of CCE\'s Subsidiaries) of CCE and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) any purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer (including a self-tender offer) for, voting securities of CCE or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or the stockholders of such Person) beneficially owning securities representing 15% or more of CCE\'s total voting power (or of the surviving entity in such transaction) or the voting power of any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated assets of CCE. 

  

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the total number of outstanding shares of the CCE Common Stock or all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of CCE and its Subsidiaries on terms that the CCE Board determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation (including any conditions relating to financing, regulatory approvals or other events or conditions beyond the control of the party invoking the condition) and availability of any necessary financing, to provide greater value to CCE\'s stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders of CCE and excepting TCCC, its Affiliates and its officers and directors) 

  

      

  
  

than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any
binding offer by TCCC to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.5(d)_ and which the CCE Board determines is reasonably likely to
be consummated).

  

 (g) CCE shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person and its Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 6.7 _ _ _Financing_. 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Splitco or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall secure and draw upon one or more borrowing facilities or consummate a financing in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration (" _Financing_ "); provided that neither CCE nor Splitco shall be obligated to sell assets nor shall they be required to cause Splitco\'s working capital to be inadequate as a result of the terms of the financing. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, CCE and Splitco shall be excused from the obligation set forth in _Section 6.7(a)_ in the event that financing is required to enable Splitco to have such cash amounts, and (i) there shall have occurred and be continuing a material adverse change or disruption in the financial, banking or capital markets generally which has rendered debt financing generally unavailable to companies similarly situated to Splitco (taking into account the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Nordic SPA) and (ii) CCE and Splitco shall have used their best efforts to permit Splitco to obtain such required financing (an " _Excused Financing Failure_ "). 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in the event that at any time prior to the Termination Date the conditions set forth in _Section 6.7 (e)_ and _6.7(f)_ are not reasonably likely to be satisfied as of the Closing, at TCCC\'s option, Splitco and/or one of its Subsidiaries, on one hand, and TCCC or one of its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall enter into a loan agreement on commercially reasonable terms to permit Splitco and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries to borrow such amount so that, immediately following the distribution of such amount to CCE and any other distribution required to be made pursuant to paragraph 7 of Schedule A, the aggregate cash available to CCE will be no less than the sum of clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph 7 of Schedule A (taking clauses (iii) and (iv) into account as a negative amount); and (b) in the event that TCCC advises Splitco in writing of its desire to exercise such option prior to the Termination Date, there shall not be deemed to be an Excused Financing Failure. 

  

      

  

 (d) CCE and TCCC shall each be permitted to extend the Closing until the 15 month anniversary of the date hereof in order to permit Splitco and CCE to obtain the Financing. 

  

 (e) In order to ensure that TCCC is not required to close the Transaction if CCE does not have cash sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration, TCCC\'s obligation to close the Transaction is conditioned on CCE having at the Effective Time cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration. 

  

 (f) In order to ensure that CCE is not required to close the Transaction if there has occurred an Excused Financing Failure, in the event of such an Excused Financing Failure, CCE and Splitco shall have no further obligations to consummate the Transactions or to pay the Cash Consideration and no party shall have any recourse against the other.

Affiliates, directors and officers to vigorously defend any Action in which
such Subsidiary or Affiliate, director or officer is named as a defendant and
which seeks any such relief to comply with this _Section 6.10(c)_ to
the same extent as if such Person were a party hereto. TCCC, CCE or Splitco,

A party providing a witness to the other party under this Section shall be entitled to receive from the recipient of such services, upon the presentation of invoices therefor, payments for such amounts, relating to disbursements and other out-of-pocket expenses (which shall not include the costs of salaries and benefits of employees who are witnesses or any pro rata portion of overhead or other costs of employing such employees which would have been incurred by such employees\' employer regardless of the employees\' service as witnesses), as may be reasonably incurred and properly paid under applicable Law.

Each of the Parties hereto shall make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under Laws applicable to it as may be required for the consummation of the Transactions. TCCC and CCE shall coordinate and cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and assistance as any of the parties hereto may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. If any consent or approval required in connection with the assignment or transfer of any Contract (other than any Shared Contract the treatment of which shall be governed by _Section 3.3_) is 

        

not obtained, or would be ineffective, violate any applicable Law or would
adversely affect the rights of CCE or its Subsidiaries thereunder such that
CCE or the North American Business Subsidiaries would not receive all rights
under such Contract contained in the North American Business Assets or Splitco
or the Other CCE Businesses Entities would not receive all rights under any
such Contract contained in the Other CCE Businesses Assets, Splitco and TCCC
shall cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which TCCC (directly
or indirectly through CCE or the North American Business Subsidiaries) or
Splitco (directly or indirectly through its Subsidiaries), as applicable,
would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance
with this Agreement, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing
to the applicable party, or under which the applicable party would enforce for
the benefit of the other, any and all rights of such other party against a
third party thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither (x) Splitco or its
Subsidiaries nor (y) any of TCCC or the North American Business Entities
shall be materially and adversely affected as a result of providing such
benefits and any such arrangement is not otherwise covered by an Ancillary
Agreement.

  

 6.12 _ _ _Antitrust Notification_. TCCC and CCE shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the expiration of any waiting period under the HSR Act or any foreign Competition Law applicable to the consummation of the Transactions, including (a) making all filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice required in connection herewith and therewith as promptly as possible (but in any event no later than the later of (1) ninety (90) days after the date of this Agreement and (2) the date of the initial filing of the Form S-4, unless agreed to by the parties), (b) cooperating and consulting with one another to determine whether any other filings are required, or deemed advisable, to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations or approvals are required, or are deemed advisable, to be obtained from any third party or any other Governmental Entity in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (c) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals and waivers and (d) generally, taking or causing to be taken, all other actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible. To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable Law, TCCC and CCE shall each cooperate, and cause its Representatives to cooperate, with the other and any Governmental Entity in taking all actions, and furnishing all information, reasonably necessary to obtain any approval, consent or termination of any applicable period from any such Governmental Entity, and shall comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it with respect to the Closing. To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable Law, TCCC shall have the right to lead and control, in its sole discretion, all discussions, submissions, negotiations and other communications with all Governmental Entities in connection with all waiting periods, authorizations or waivers required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, subject to reasonable concerns regarding confidentiality, TCCC shall keep CCE reasonably informed with respect to such matters.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, TCCC and CCE will use their respective reasonable best efforts to offer to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including taking all such further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Entity or any other Person may assert under 

        

any Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as expeditiously possible;
_provided_ , _however_ that (i) nothing in this _Section 6.12_ shall
require, or be construed to require, TCCC or any of its respective
Subsidiaries to take any action, including respond to and/or defend any court
or administrative proceeding, propose or make any divestiture or other
undertaking, or propose or enter into any consent decree or to take any action
which TCCC reasonably determines could be material to the benefits expected
to be derived by TCCC as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby or
be material to the business of TCCC and its Subsidiaries or the
North American Business as currently conducted or as contemplated to be
conducted following the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) CCE shall
not take (or permit any of its Affiliates to take) any action described in
clause (i) above without TCCC\'s prior written consent; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if TCCC does not provide its written consent after being
requested to do so, CCE will not be liable for failing to take any such
action, but this shall not affect CCE\'s obligation to otherwise take action
required by this _Section 6.12_, subject to TCCC\'s consent, if applicable.

  

 6.13 _ _ _Public Announcements_. CCE and TCCC shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, issue any public report, statement or press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions, from the date hereof through the Effective Time, without prior consultation with and approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or securities exchange regulations applicable to any such party, in which case such party shall advise the other party and discuss the contents of the disclosure before issuing any such report, statement or press release. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, TCCC and CCE shall not send any general written communication to suppliers, lenders, creditors, distributors, employees, customers or others having business or financial relationships with the North American Business Subsidiaries pertaining to this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions, without the prior written approval of the other party (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

position and results of operations of the North American Business Entities as
of the date and for the periods presented. In the event that the Closing has
not occurred prior to such time as documents required to be filed by TCCC
with the SEC would require inclusion of an audited balance sheet of the North
American Business Entities at December 31, 2010 and related audited statements
of income and cash flows of the North American Business Entities for the year
ended December 31, 2010, CCE and Splitco shall use commercially reasonable

In the event that the Form S-4 has not been declared effective and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus has not been mailed to stockholders of CCE prior to such time as such documents would require inclusion of an audited balance sheet of the Other CCE Businesses at December 31, 2010 and related audited statements of income and cash flows of the Other CCE Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the " _2010 S-4 Financial Statements_ " (or CCE and Splitco are otherwise required to disclose such information to stockholders of CCE), CCE and Splitco shall prepare the 2010 S-4 Financial Statements as promptly as practicable.

2010, TCCC shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver such

In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and TCCC shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause the charters and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the charters and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of CCE as of the date hereof, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to any Indemnified Person except as required by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 6.19(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and TCCC shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any Losses in connection with any Action, to the extent such Action arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Person\'s capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of CCE or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates for such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to CCE a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.19(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Person\'s entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto unless it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification under Law or the DGCL), and (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled at his or her sole cost and expense to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this  _Section 6.19(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including TCCC) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes a full release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry. 

  

 (c) At Splitco\'s direction, TCCC shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium (in each case, at TCCC\'s expense) for the extension of (i) the directors\' and officers\' liability coverage of CCE\'s or any of the North American Business Subsidiaries\' existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policies and (ii) CCE\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case, set forth on _Section 6.19_ of 

  

      

  
  

the CCE Disclosure Letter (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case
for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time with respect to any claim involving any Indemnified
Person in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
and with a carrier and upon terms that are reasonably acceptable to CCE and
that are, with respect to coverage and amount, no less favorable than those of
CCE\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' existing DandO Insurance; _provided_  that
the aggregate cost of such policy shall not exceed that amount set forth in
_Section 6.19_ of the CCE Disclosure Letter; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
if the aggregate premiums of such DandO Insurance exceeds such amount, the
Surviving Corporation promptly shall notify CCE of such excess and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain DandO Insurance with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount, and Splitco shall be
entitled to contribute additional amounts to increase coverage. The Surviving
Corporation shall (and TCCC shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder.

  

 (d) If the Surviving Corporation (or TCCC) or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or TCCC) set forth in this  _Section 6.19_. 

  

 (e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.19_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other Person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.19(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other Person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section 6.19(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.19(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 6.19(e)_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other Persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.19(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 6.19_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons may have under the charters, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by CCE or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). 

  

 (f) The obligations and liability of the Surviving Corporation, TCCC and their respective Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.19_ shall be joint and several. Nothing in this _Section 6.19_ is intended to (i) limit the rights of any TCCC Indemnified Party to indemnification from Splitco to the extent provided for in _Article IX_ in respect of amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 6.19_ or (ii) entitle any party to recover any amounts in connection with this _Section 6.19_ to the extent that such party or any of its Affiliates has already recovered such amount pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to CCE or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.19_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

the applicable credit facility, debt security facility, or other Contract).
To the extent that Splitco and CCE are unable to cause the removal of any such
Other CCE Businesses Entity prior to the Effective Time, (i) any and all
Liabilities arising from the actions of such Other CCE Businesses Entity under
the applicable Contract after the Effective Time shall be deemed to be an
Other CCE Businesses Liability, (ii) and any and all Liabilities arising
from the actions of CCE under the applicable Contract after the Effective Time
in respect of the applicable Contract shall be deemed to be a North American
Business Liability for which TCCC shall indemnify the CCE Indemnified Parties

If the Certified Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital is greater than Target Adjusted Net Working Capital, then TCCC shall pay or cause to be paid to Splitco at the Closing an amount equal to such difference. If the Certified Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital is less than Target Adjusted Net Working Capital, then Splitco shall pay or cause to be paid at the Closing an amount equal to such difference to TCCC. 

   

 (b) Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, TCCC shall in good faith prepare and deliver to Splitco (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the North American Business Entities as of the Effective Time prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence of notes) (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (ii) a statement (the " _Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth TCCC\'s calculation of the Adjusted Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, based on such Closing Balance Sheet calculated on a basis consistent with  _Schedule C_ (the " _Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital_ "). 

   

 (c) Without prejudice to any of TCCC\'s rights hereunder, following the Closing, in the event that TCCC believes in good faith that Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital is greater or lesser than Certified Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital, the following provisions will apply: 

    

 (i) TCCC and the North American Business Entities shall permit Splitco and their representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other documents (including work papers) pertaining to or used in connection with preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and TCCC\'s calculation of the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital and provide Splitco with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by Splitco). If Splitco disagrees with TCCC\'s calculation of the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital as set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet, Splitco shall, within thirty (30) days after Splitco\'s receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, notify TCCC in writing of such disagreement by setting forth Splitco\'s calculation of the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital and describing in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ "). If no Objection Notice is delivered on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after Splitco\'s receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, TCCC\'s calculation of the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital shall be deemed to be 

   

      

   

binding on the parties hereto. If an Objection Notice is timely delivered to
TCCC, then TCCC and Splitco shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their
disagreements with respect to the computation of the Closing Adjusted Net
Working Capital. In the event that TCCC and Splitco are unable to resolve all
such disagreements within fifteen (15) days after TCCC\'s receipt of such
Objection Notice, TCCC and Splitco shall submit such remaining disagreements
to an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable
to TCCC and Splitco (the " _Auditor_ ") for resolution.

The Auditor shall consider only those items and amounts in TCCC\'s and Splitco\'s respective calculations of the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital that are identified as being items and amounts to which TCCC and Splitco have been unable to agree on. In resolving any disputed item, the Auditor shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and the Auditor may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Auditor\'s determination of the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital shall not be limited to the materials submitted by TCCC and Splitco but may include any relevant accounting literature or guidance, and shall be based on the definition of "Adjusted Net Working Capital" included herein. The determination of the Auditor shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. 

  

 (iii) The costs and expenses of the Auditor in determining the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital shall be borne equally by TCCC, on the one hand, and Splitco, on the other hand. 

  

 (iv) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to this  _Section 6.23(c)_, Splitco shall pay to CCE or CCE shall pay to Splitco, as the case may be, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of Certified Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital over Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital, or Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital over Certified Closing Adjusted Net Working Capital, respectively, which payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by TCCC or Splitco, as applicable. 

    

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, amounts paid or required to be paid pursuant to Paragraph 7 of _Schedule A_,  _Section 6.24,_ or _Section 3.14(b)_ of the Employee Matters Agreement shall not be taken into account in the determination of the Adjusted Net Working Capital of the North American Business or any payments required to be made pursuant to this _Section 6.23_. 

   

 (e) All payments made pursuant to _Section 6.23(c)_ and any other payment, adjustment, reimbursement, or amount made or taken into account (collectively, payments) under this Agreement after the Effective Time shall be treated by all parties hereto (and all of their Affiliates) for all Tax purposes as non-taxable payments made immediately prior to the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. To the extent practicable, any such payments to CCE or any Subsidiary of CCE by Splitco or any Subsidiary of Splitco following the Closing will be segregated by CCE and transferred as promptly as practicable to creditors of CCE in payment of debt outstanding on the date hereof or incurred subsequent to the date hereof in the ordinary course of business, or to shareholders of CCE in respect of their CCE shares. 

  

  

 6.24 _ _ _CCE Tax Benefits_. On the Closing Date, TCCC shall pay to CCE an amount equal to $150,000,000, which represents the amount owed by TCCC for Tax benefits of the North American 

        

Business Subsidiaries. Such payment shall be made or taken into account in
the manner set forth in Paragraph 7 of _Schedule A_.

   

 6.25 _ _ _Certain Nordic SPA Matters_. As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, TCCC shall, subject to consultation with, and obtaining the opinion of, the works council of parent company of the Nordic Entities, cause such parent to become a party to the Nordic SPA.

 (c) by CCE, if TCCC or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ of this Agreement and (ii) is incapable of being cured (or is not cured) by TCCC or Merger Sub by the Termination Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any such condition to be capable of satisfaction is not the result of a material breach of this Agreement by CCE or Splitco; 

  

 (d) by TCCC, if CCE or Splitco shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_, _7.3(b)_ or  _7.3(c)_ of this Agreement, and (ii) is incapable of being cured (or is not cured) by CCE or Splitco by the Termination Date, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the failure of any such condition to be capable of satisfaction is not the result of a material breach of this Agreement by TCCC or Merger Sub;

 8.2 _ _ _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Transactions pursuant to _Section 8.1_ hereof, written notice thereof shall be given by the party so terminating to the other party to this Agreement, and this Agreement shall terminate and the Transactions shall be abandoned without further action by CCE or TCCC; _provided_ , however, that: 

  

  

 (a) If this Agreement is terminated and the Transactions are abandoned as described in this _Section 8.2_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or effect, except for the obligations provided for in _Section 6.13_, this _Section 8.2_ and _Article X_ hereof, the confidentiality provision contained in _Section 6.8(b)_ hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement referred to in such Section, each of which shall survive any such termination of this Agreement without limitation. 

  

 (b) If (i) TCCC or CCE terminates this Agreement due to the failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(d)_; (ii) all other conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and in _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions); and (iii) neither CCE nor Splitco have breached in any material respect any of their covenants set forth in this Agreement, then TCCC shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days following such termination), pay to CCE, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to twice the amount of the reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred and paid by CCE or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with negotiation of this Agreement, the performance by CCE or Splitco of their obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Transactions, not to exceed $100,000,000 (the " _CCE Expense Reimbursement_ "). 

  

      

  

 (c) If TCCC terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ at a time when there is a Change in CCE Recommendation, then CCE shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within three (3) Business Days following such termination), pay to TCCC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $200,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "). 

  

 (d) In the event that (A) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced, (B) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, (C) at the time of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, neither TCCC nor Merger Sub has breached any of its material obligations under or in connection with this Agreement in any material respect, and (D) within 365 calendar days following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then CCE shall pay to TCCC the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by TCCC, within two Business Days after the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this provision, each reference to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%." 

   

 (e) Each of TCCC and CCE acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section 8.2(b)_, _Section 8.2(c)_ and _Section 8.2(d)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, CCE, TCCC and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if CCE fails promptly to pay any amount due to TCCC, or TCCC fails promptly to pay any amount due to CCE, pursuant to  _Section 8.2(b)_, _Section 8.2(c)_ and _Section 8.2(d)_, then such non-paying party shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by CCE or TCCC or Merger Sub, as applicable, in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a final judgment against CCE or TCCC, as applicable, for such amount. 

   

 (f) In the event that TCCC shall receive the Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by TCCC, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of TCCC, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against CCE or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination. 

  

 (g) For the avoidance of doubt, except as expressly provided in _Section 8.2(f)_ any termination of this Agreement shall not be deemed to release and shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for any fraud occurring on or prior to such termination.

If any party makes a claim with respect to any specific representation, warranty, covenant or agreement within the time period described in this _Section 9.1_, and such claim is not fully and finally resolved prior to the expiration of such time period, such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive solely with respect to such claim until such claim is finally and fully resolved.

 (a) any failure of any representation or warranty of CCE or Splitco set forth in this Agreement or the Employee Matters Agreement or the certificates delivered pursuant to  _Section 7.3(d)_ that survives after the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 9.1_ to be true and correct in all respects as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct shall be measured as of such earlier date) as such representation or warranty would read if all qualifications to materiality, including each reference to the term North American Business Material Adverse Effect, were deleted therefrom; 

  

      

  

 (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement of Splitco or, prior to the Effective Time, CCE, contained in this Agreement or the Employee Matters Agreement;

 (e) any Transaction Expenses payable by CCE or Splitco in accordance with _Section 10.1_. 

  

  

 9.3 _ _ _Splitco\'s Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary (except for Tax matters which shall be governed by the Tax Sharing Agreement), the obligation of Splitco to indemnify TCCC Indemnified Parties pursuant to (A) _Section 9.2(a)_ against any Losses sustained by reason of any claim with respect to the breach of a representation or warranty (other than Losses (i) arising out of, relating to or resulting from breaches or inaccuracies of any Fundamental Representation or (ii) arising out of or resulting from fraud or willful material breach by Splitco or, prior to the Effective Time, CCE (such Losses in (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Splitco Uncapped Claims_ ")) or (B) _Section 9.2(b)_ against any Losses sustained by reason of any claim with respect to the breach by CCE or Splitco of a covenant, shall be limited to claims as to which a TCCC Indemnified Party has given Splitco written notice, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the basis for such claim, on or prior to the termination of such representation or warranty or covenant pursuant to _Section 9.1_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions for indemnification contained in _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than for Losses constituting Splitco Uncapped Claims) shall be effective only after the aggregate amount of all such claims which are so indemnifiable exceeds an amount equal to two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000) (the " _Basket_ "), and only to the extent of such excess;  _provided_ _further_ that Splitco shall not be liable to any TCCC Indemnified Party for any particular claim under  _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than for Losses constituting Splitco Uncapped Claims), unless the amount of such claim exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") and is in excess of any reserves reflected on the Audited CCE 2009 Financial Statements with respect to such Losses and all such Losses in respect of any claim or series of related claims which total less than the De Minimis Amount or which have not exceeded any relevant reserve shall be excluded in their entirety from calculations with respect to the Basket or Cap, and the TCCC Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse for such Losses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of all indemnification payments for which Splitco is liable pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ (other than for Losses constituting Splitco Uncapped Claims), exceed an amount equal to two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) (the " _Cap_ ").

 (a) any failure of any representation or warranty of TCCC set forth in this Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement or the certificates delivered pursuant to  _Section 7.2(c)_ that survives 

  

      

  

after the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 9.1_ to be true and correct in
all respects as of the date hereof and as of the Effective Time (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct shall be
measured as of such earlier date) as such representation or warranty would
read if all qualifications to materiality were deleted therefrom;

  

 (b) the breach of any covenant or agreement of TCCC or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or the Employee Matters Agreement; 

   

 (c) any North American Business Liability (for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall TCCC have any obligation under this  _Section 9.4(c)_ to the extent Splitco is obligated to indemnify any TCCC Indemnified Party); 

  

 (d) with respect to amounts actually paid to former stockholders of CCE in connection with an appraisal proceeding in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, TCCC shall only be liable pursuant to this _Section 9.4(d)_ for amounts actually paid in respect of an appraised value per share in excess of the Appraisal Threshold (it being understood that if the appraised value per share actually paid exceeds the Appraisal Threshold, TCCC shall only be liable for the allocable portion of the total payment in excess of the Appraisal Threshold) and 50% of any fees and expenses incurred in connection with the appraisal proceedings); and 

  

 (e) any Transaction Expenses payable by TCCC in accordance with _Section 10.1_. 

  

  

 9.5 _ _ _TCCC\'s Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary (except for Tax matters which shall be governed by the Tax Sharing Agreement), the obligation of TCCC to indemnify CCE Indemnified Parties pursuant to (A) _Section 9.4(a)_ hereof, against any Losses sustained by reason of any claim with respect to the breach of a representation or warranty (other than Losses (i) arising out of, relating to or resulting from breaches or inaccuracies of any Fundamental Representation or (ii) arising out of or resulting from fraud or willful material breach by TCCC (such Losses in (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _TCCC Uncapped Claims_ ")) or (B) _Section 9.4(b)_ against any Losses sustained by reason of any claim with respect to the breach by TCCC of a covenant shall be limited to claims as to which a CCE Indemnified Party has given TCCC written notice, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the basis for such claim, on or prior to the termination of such representation, warranty or covenant pursuant to _Section 9.1_ hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions for indemnification contained in _Section 9.4(a)_ (other than for Losses constituting TCCC Uncapped Claims) shall be effective only after the aggregate amount of all such claims which are so indemnifiable exceed the Basket, and only to the extent of such excess;  _provided_ _further_ that TCCC shall not be liable to any CCE Indemnified Party for any particular claim under _Section 9.4(a)_ (other than for Losses constituting TCCC Uncapped Claims) unless the amount of such claim exceeds the De Minimis Amount and all such Losses in respect of any claim or series of related claims which total less than the De Minimis Amount shall be excluded in their entirety from calculations with respect to the Basket or Cap, and the CCE Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse for such Losses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of all indemnification payments for which TCCC is liable pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ (other than for Losses constituting TCCC Uncapped Claims) exceed an amount equal to the Cap. 

  

 9.6 _ _ _Third-Party Claims_. Except for Tax matters which shall be governed solely by the Tax Sharing Agreement, the obligations and liabilities of Splitco and TCCC with respect to any claims made by the TCCC Indemnified Parties and the CCE Indemnified Parties, respectively, which arise or result from claims for Losses made by third parties (" _Third-Party Claim_ "), shall be subject to the following terms and conditions: 

  

  

 (a) The indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of any such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) failure to give such notification shall not affect the 

  

      

  

indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure; and
(ii) the indemnifying party shall have the right, after it acknowledges in
writing to the indemnified party its obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party hereunder, to undertake the defense thereof by counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party at the indemnifying party\'s sole
expense; _provided_ , that if the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party
shall control such defense;

  

 (b) Within thirty (30) Business Days following the receipt of notice of a Third-Party Claim, if the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense of such Third-Party Claim or has declined to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim in writing, the indemnified party shall (upon further written notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying party subject to the right of the indemnifying party to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim at any time prior to settlement, compromise or final determination thereof (subject to _Section 9.6(a)(ii)_); and 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this _Article IX_ to the contrary, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or delayed), the indemnifying party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto, except in the case of any settlement that (i) includes as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the indemnified party of a written unconditional release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim and (ii) provides solely for monetary relief and does not otherwise involve or purport to bind or limit the indemnified party. In addition, if the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto, without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any such admission, settlement, compromise, discharge or consent to judgment made by an indemnified party without such prior written consent of the indemnifying party. 

  

  

 9.7 _ _ _Other Claims_. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim against any indemnifying party under _Section 9.2_ or _9.4_ hereof that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall, as promptly as practicable after discovery of such claim, deliver written notice of such claim to the indemnifying party. The failure by any indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under  _Section 9.2_ or _9.4_ hereof, except to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within thirty (30) Business Days following its receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party under _Section 9.2_ or _9.4_ hereof, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under _Section 9.2_ or _9.4_ hereof, and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the indemnifying party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall 

        

proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation
pursuant to  _Section 10.9_ hereof.

  

 9.8 _ _ _Sole Remedy; Other Limitations; etc._ 

  

  

 (a) TCCC and Splitco acknowledge and agree that, if the Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive monetary remedy (other than for fraud or willful material breach or misrepresentation) following the Closing with respect to any and all claims (whether Third-Party Claims or otherwise) relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in the Ancillary Agreements, _Section 6.23_ and this _Article IX_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent an indemnified party from pursuing non-monetary remedies as may be available to such party under applicable Law in the event of a party\'s failure to comply with its obligation hereunder. 

   

 (b) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Nothing in this _Article IX_ is intended to entitle any party to recover any amounts in connection with this _Article IX_ to the extent that such party or any of its Affiliates has already recovered such amount pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including as a result of any payments in respect of Adjusted Net Working Capital pursuant to _Section 6.23_. 

  

 (c) TCCC and Splitco agree that any payment made among the parties pursuant to _Section 6.23_ or this  _Article IX_ shall be treated, to the extent permitted by Law, for all Tax purposes as a non-taxable payment made immediately prior to the Closing. Any indemnification payments under this Agreement for indemnifiable Losses shall be paid net of (or, in the case of a Tax detriment, increased by) (i) any insurance proceeds actually recovered by the indemnified party with respect to such Losses, _minus_ an amount equal to (x) the amount of the net after tax cost of insurance premiums paid by the indemnified party in the same policy year as the claim for such Losses for the insurance policy under which such insurance proceeds are recovered multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the amount of such insurance proceeds actually recovered and the denominator of which shall be the total coverage amount of the insurance policy under which such insurance proceeds are recovered; (ii) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the indemnified party or its Affiliates from any third party with respect to such Losses,  _minus_ the amount of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred and necessary to recover such third party payment; and (iii) any Tax benefit or Tax detriment to the indemnified party or its Affiliates as set forth in _Section 9.10_. In the event that an applicable insurance or other recovery is received by any indemnified party with respect to any indemnification payment for which any such Person has been indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of such applicable recovery with respect to such indemnification payment shall be made promptly to the indemnifying party. 

  

 (d) With respect to Losses arising out of or resulting from any breach of _Section 4.21_, including any such Losses arising out of or resulting from the Cleanup of any Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Materials on, from or adjacent to any Real Property, such Losses shall only include amounts to the extent required by a Governmental Entity or required by an applicable Environmental Law and incurred in the most cost-effective and commercially reasonable manner for achieving compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or directives of a Governmental Entity, applicable to the use of the property involved at the Effective Time, including where authorized the use of engineering or institutional controls such as deed restrictions and other land use restrictions. Splitco shall have no obligation to provide indemnification for any such Losses to the extent they arise from or as a consequence of any (i) changes in Environmental Law coming into effect subsequent to the Effective Time, (ii) any voluntary disclosure subsequent 

  

      

  
  

to the Effective Time by a TCCC Indemnified Party, or (iii) sampling, testing
or analysis of any environmental media by or on behalf of any TCCC Indemnified
Party on or after the Effective Time which is not required by an
Environmental Law or by a Governmental Entity.

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, each indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise thereto, including by seeking to collect or recover any available third party insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment available to the indemnified party or its Affiliates from any third party with respect to any such Losses (it being understood that the obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to collect or recover any third party insurance proceeds or payments available from third parties shall not require the indemnified party to commence any litigation proceedings against any such third party); _provided_ that the indemnified party\'s inability to collect or recover any such insurance proceeds or payments from third parties shall not limit or delay the indemnifying party\'s obligations hereunder. Any Losses incurred in contravention of this subsection shall not be recoverable hereunder by the relevant indemnified party. 

  

 (f) Any insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification and contributions provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto. 

  

  

 9.9 _ _ _Exclusivity of Tax Sharing Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Tax Sharing Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to indemnification for Tax matters. Any conflict between the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement and any provision of this Agreement, or any provision of any other agreement, shall be resolved in favor of the Tax Sharing Agreement, unless such other provision expressly provides that it shall be given priority over the Tax Sharing Agreement. 

  

 9.10 _ _ _Offset against Tax Benefits_. All indemnification payments under this Agreement shall be reduced to take account of the present value of any net Tax benefit (including, but not limited to, any current or future deductions, any reduction of income or gain upon a sale, disposition, conveyance, license or other similar transaction as a result of increased Tax basis, any Tax refunds received, any use of a credit of Taxes and any increase in the amount of losses, reliefs, allowances or other similar Tax attributes) and shall be increased to take account of the present value of any net Tax detriment realized by the indemnified party or its Affiliates in connection with or otherwise arising (directly or indirectly) from an indemnified Loss, including, without limitation, any Tax detriment resulting from an indemnification payment for such Loss. Upon the written request of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall provide the amount of the net Tax benefit and/or Tax detriment realized by the indemnified party in connection with or otherwise arising (directly or indirectly) from an indemnified Loss together with reasonable detail with respect to such calculation. In computing the amount of any such net Tax benefit and/or Tax detriment, the indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (other than carryback items) before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnification payment hereunder or from a Tax Controversy. The indemnified party shall cooperate fully with all commercially reasonable requests from the indemnifying party in connection with determining the present value of such net Tax benefit and/or Tax detriment.

 10.4 _ _ _Entire Agreement; Modification_. 

  

  

 (a) The agreement of the parties, which consists of this Agreement, the CCE Disclosure Letter, the TCCC Disclosure Letter, the Ancillary Agreements, to the extent entered into, and the exhibits schedules and other documents referred to herein which form a part hereof (including, the Confidentiality Agreement referred to in  _Section 6.8_ hereof), sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, this Agreement may be modified and/or amended with respect to any provision contained herein at any time by written action of CCE, 

  

      

  
  

Splitco and TCCC at any time before or after receipt of the Required CCE
Vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the receipt of the Required
CCE Vote there may not be, without further approval of the stockholders of
CCE, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered to the holders of CCE Common Stock
hereunder or which, by applicable Law, requires the further approval of such
stockholders.

  

  

 10.5 _ _ _Waiver_. Any term or condition hereof may be waived at any time by the party hereto that is entitled to the benefits thereof by a written instrument duly executed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

  

 10.6 _ _ _Assignment; Binding Effect; Severability_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be transferred, assigned or delegated by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and in the event that any one or more provisions are deemed illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect unless the deletion of such provision shall cause this Agreement to become materially adverse to any party, in which event the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrive at an accommodation that best preserves for the parties the benefits and obligations of the offending provision. 

  

 10.7 _ _ _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation of the Transactions, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction as provided in _Section 10.9_ to compel performance of such party\'s obligations and to the granting by any such court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder without proof of actual damages and without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a party\'s breach of its obligations but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. 

   

 10.8 _ _ _Governing Law_. This agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflicts of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 10.9 _ _ _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (b) any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), for the purposes of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions (and each agrees that no such Action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought by it except in such courts). The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive (and agree not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions in (i) the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (ii) any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) or that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and non-appealable judgment 

        
  

against a party hereto in connection with any Action shall be conclusive and
binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any
court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United
States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment.

   

 10.10 _ _ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any Action directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each party (a) certifies that no Representative of the other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of an Action, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.10_. 

  

 10.11 _ _ _Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder (except as set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement, _Section 6.19_ and in  _Article IX_ with respect to TCCC Indemnified Parties and CCE Indemnified Parties). 

  

 10.12 _ _ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 10.13 _ _ _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Party shall be liable to or otherwise responsible to any other Party hereto or any Affiliate of any other Party hereto for any damages including, exemplary, punitive, consequential, incidental, indirect or special damages or lost profits that arise out of or relate to a breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement under any and all theories of liability in an amount that exceeds $200,000,000 (or $150,000,000 if the damages arise out of a breach of a covenant that is within the Knowledge of CCE or Knowledge of TCCC, as applicable prior to the Effective Time but for which such party has failed to provide prompt written notice to the other) plus related actual out-of-pocket expenses; provided that, (a) if any party hereto shall have acted in willful and reckless disregard of its obligations set forth in this Agreement, or (b) any party shall have failed to cure by the Termination Date a breach of a covenant or agreement for which the other party has provided prompt written notice, then the other party shall be entitled to pursue any remedy it has at law including to seek any and all damages (without limitation in amount) including exemplary, punitive, consequential, incidental, indirect or special damages or lost profits or under any other theory of liability. 

       

 [_SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW]_

2.03 TAX SHARING OBLIGATIONS AND PRIOR AGREEMENTS. 

  

 (a) Except as provided in Section 4.01, TCCC and the members of the CCE Group shall be responsible for the payment of (and shall be entitled to any refund of, whether received in cash or applied against future Tax obligations) (i) all Taxes for any Post-Closing Period attributable to any member of the CCE Group or the North American Business, other than (A) Taxes arising as a result of the Separation Transactions (including the Merger), or any transaction incidental thereto entered into for the purpose of effecting the Separation Transactions, as mutually agreed by the Parties, except to the extent such Taxes are described in clause (ii) or arise as a result of any breach of any covenant or any other obligation contained in the Tax Materials or this Agreement or the Merger Agreement by TCCC or any of its Subsidiaries or, following the Effective Time, any member of the CCE Group, and (ii) 50% of any Taxes arising as a result of the Merger not qualifying under Section 355 of the Code, to the extent such Taxes do not arise as a result of any breach of any covenant or any other obligation contained in the Tax Materials or this Agreement by TCCC, Splitco or any of their Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _TCCC Taxes_ "). 

  

 (b) Except as provided in Section 4.01, Splitco and the members of the Splitco Group shall be responsible for the payment of (and shall be entitled to any refund of, whether received in cash or applied against future Tax obligations) (i) all Taxes attributable to any member of the Splitco Group or the Other CCE Businesses, (ii) all Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period attributable to any member of the CCE Group or the North American Business, (iii) 50% of any Taxes arising as a result of the Merger not qualifying under Section 355 of the Code, to the extent such Taxes do no arise as a result of any breach of any covenant or any other obligation contained in the Tax Materials or this Agreement by TCCC, Splitco or any of their Subsidiaries, and (iv) the Taxes described in Section 2.03(a)(i)(A) (collectively, the " _Splitco Taxes_ ").

In the case of any Taxes for a Straddle Period for which such election to close the taxable year is not permitted, the portion of such Taxes that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the Closing Date shall be: (i) in the case of ad valorem or similar Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis, an amount equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period prior to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire relevant Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in (i) (such as Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Taxable Year ended on and included the Closing Date. Any income, deductions, gains or losses recognized on transactions not in the ordinary course of business on or prior to the Effective Time will be allocated to the Pre-Closing Period, and any income, deductions, gains or losses recognized on any transactions not in the ordinary course of business after the Effective Time (including after the Effective Time but on the Closing Date) will be allocated to the Post-Closing Period.

 (e) Except as set forth in this Agreement and in consideration of the mutual indemnities and other obligations in this Agreement, (i) any and all prior Tax sharing or allocation agreements or practices between any member of the CCE Group, on one hand, and any member of the Splitco Group, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of or before the Effective Time, and no member of one group shall have any continuing rights or obligations thereunder with respect to any member of the other group and (ii) any and all powers of attorney with respect to any member of the CCE Group shall be terminated as of or before the Effective Time, and no member of the CCE Group shall have any continuing obligations thereunder.

TCCC shall provide a response to a request for such consent from Splitco within fifteen (15) Business Days following the receipt of such request.

Splitco shall provide a response to a request for such consent from TCCC within fifteen (15) Business Days following the receipt of such request.

TCCC (or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) shall pay by wire transfer to Splitco and Splitco (or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) shall pay by wire transfer to TCCC the payor\'s share of the Transfer Taxes which are payable with Tax Returns to be filed by the other Party (or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) at least three days prior to the due date for the payment of such Transfer Taxes.

 4.03 TIMING OF PAYMENTS. The Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any Claim to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of the Claim, _provided_ _that_ , if such Claim is still subject to the outcome of any Tax Contest, then payment shall not be due until fifteen (15) Business Days after such Claim either is resolved through a Final Determination, or prior to a Final Determination, if the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree on the indemnification obligation under this Agreement with respect to such Claim.

The Revised CCE Tax Benefits Certificate shall be amended as required to reflect any adjustments in any item of CCE Tax Benefits pursuant to a Final Determination and the amount of any resulting adjustment in the Revised Certified CCE Tax Benefits shall be paid by Splitco to CCE or returned by CCE to Splitco (but not in excess of such amounts previously received by CCE and not returned to Splitco under this Section 4.04), as appropriate in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. Any dispute or disagreement between the Parties under this Section 4.04 shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of ARTICLE VIII. 

  

 4.05 PENSION CONTRIBUTION. 

  

 (a) The payment by TCCC to CCE upon Closing pursuant to Section 3.14(b) of the Employee Matters Agreement (without taking into account a reduction in such amount pursuant to Section 3.14(b)(ii)) shall be equal to the lesser of (i) the Pre-Tax Contribution Amount and (ii) the sum of (A) 63% of the Pre-Tax Contribution Amount and (B) the excess of (x) the Certified CCE Tax Benefits above $292,000,000, over (y) the amount described in clause (x) calculated as if the Pre-Tax Contribution Amount had not been contributed to the Section 3.14 Pension Plans (as such term is defined in the Employee Matters Agreement). Such payment shall be made or taken into account in the manner set forth in Paragraph 7 of Schedule A of the Merger Agreement. Upon the determination of the Revised Certified CCE Tax Benefits and any subsequent adjustment thereto pursuant to Section 4.04, the amount payable pursuant to Section 3.14(b) of the Employee Matters Agreement (as calculated under this Section 4.05(a)) shall be redetermined, and the difference between such previously determined amount and the redetermined amount shall be paid by TCCC to Splitco (in the case of an increase in such amount) or by Splitco to TCCC (in the case of a decrease in such amount). 

  

 (b) "Pre-Tax Contribution Amount" shall mean the sum of (i) $145,000,000 (which represents the amount of all contributions to the Section 3.14 Pension Plans (as such term is defined in the Employee Matters Agreement) in 2009) and (ii) the amount (if any) of all contributions to the Section 3.14 Pension Plans (as such term is defined in the Employee Matters Agreement) made in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.14(b) of the Employee Matters Agreement after December 31, 2009 and on or before the Effective Time.

(indemnification) of the Merger Agreement and any other purchase price
adjustments under the Merger Agreement, (iii) Schedule A to the Merger
Agreement, and (iv) Section 3.14(b) of the Employee Matters Agreement shall
be treated, to the extent permitted by Law, for all Tax purposes as a non-
taxable payment made immediately prior to the Merger; _provided_ , _however_
, that to the extent the Parties are required by applicable Law to treat any
post-Closing payment made pursuant to this Agreement as a taxable payment,
the Tax imposed on such payment (including as a direct or indirect consequence
of such payment) shall not be subject to indemnification under this Agreement
or the Merger Agreement. To the extent practicable, any such payments to CCE
or any Affiliate of CCE by Splitco or any member of the Splitco Group
following the Closing will be segregated by CCE and transferred as promptly
as practicable to creditors of CCE in payment of debt outstanding on the date
hereof or incurred subsequent to the date hereof in the ordinary course of

 CCE shall retain the obligation for continuation coverage (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code) for Former CCE Employees (and their spouses and eligible dependents) who are as of immediately prior to the Effective Time eligible for such coverage pursuant to a CCE Benefit Plan. 

  

 2.6 _Long-Term Disability_. 

  

 CCE shall retain the obligation to provide continued long-term disability benefits for any CCE North American Employees and Former CCE Employees who were employed in the North American Business at the time they became eligible for such benefits, in each case, who are receiving such benefits as of the Effective Time. Such long-term disability benefits shall be, with respect to each such CCE North American Employee or Former CCE Employee, substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits such individual is receiving as of the Effective Time. 

  

Article 3

  

_CCE North American Employees_

  

 3.1 _Level of Compensation and Benefits_. 

  

 From the Effective Time through and including December 31, 2011, TCCC shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to the non-represented CCE North American Employees (i) salary, wages and annual cash bonus opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, retaining CCE\'s pay and bonus structure, salary bands, compensation ranges and target bonus levels within such salary bands, and executive perquisite allowances as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) benefits (other than equity-based compensation, which shall be governed solely under Section 3.2, and other employee benefits specifically provided for in this Agreement) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided to the CCE North American Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time under the North American Benefit Plans listed in Section 4.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter other than the CCE Stock Plans, in each case, subject to the CCE North American Employee\'s continued employment with TCCC or one of its Affiliates; provided, however, that with respect to the CCE North American Employees set forth on Schedule 2.2, TCCC and, if applicable, its Subsidiaries, shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to provide such individuals with substantially comparable salary, bonus opportunities, benefits and expatriate allowances in accordance with applicable Laws. 

       

                                       
3.2 _Equity-Based Compensation_. 

  

 (a) CCE shall not grant any equity-based awards to any CCE North American Employee from the date of this Agreement through October 15, 2010, other than equity-based awards made (i) to newly hired employees, within one year following the employee\'s date of hire, that are in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with CCE\'s past practice of compensating newly hired employees, (ii) prior to September 1, 2010, to employees to correct administrative errors in the employees\' most recent annual equity-based awards, (iii) to a Transferred CCE North American Employee identified to TCCC prior to such grant, or (iv) with the consent of TCCC, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. In the event that as of October 15, 2010, the parties reasonably determine that the Effective Time shall not occur prior to December 15, 2010, following consultation with TCCC, CCE may make grants of equity-based awards no later than December 15, 2010, (such grants, collectively, the "CCE 2010 Grant") to CCE North American Employees (excluding for this purpose grants made to Transferred CCE North American Employees who have been identified to TCCC prior to the date of the CCE 2010 Grant) that are in accordance with CCE\'s past practice and guidelines with respect to annual grants, made most recently in November 2009 to CCE North American Employees; provided, however, that (x) in no event shall the CCE 2010 Grant have an aggregate value as of the grant date (based on a reasonable Black-Scholes valuation or grant date fair value methodology, as applicable, to be agreed between TCCC and CCE) that is greater than the aggregate value as of the grant date of the aggregate annual equity awards made by CCE in November 2009 to CCE North American Employees (excluding for this purpose grants made to Transferred CCE North American Employees who have been identified to TCCC prior to the date of the CCE 2010 Grant), and (y) each award made pursuant to the CCE 2010 Grant shall specify that the transactions contemplated by the Separation and Merger Agreement shall not constitute a "Change in Control" if the Effective Time occurs prior to December 31, 2011; and provided, further, that this sentence shall not limit CCE\'s ability to make grants of equity-based awards to CCE Other Employees who are not Transferred CCE North American Employees, and to Transferred CCE North American Employees who have been identified to TCCC prior to the date of the CCE 2010 Grant. 

  

 (b) At such time after the Effective Time as TCCC makes its regular annual equity awards to its employees in 2011 and no later than June 30, 2011, TCCC shall provide equity-based awards to CCE North American Employees who hold a position in the Senior Management Broad Band or above (or a comparable TCCC position) having a substantially comparable value in the aggregate, for a comparable number of employees, as of the date of grant (based on a reasonable Black-Scholes value for stock option grants and based on the grant date fair value for whole share-based awards) as awarded by CCE to its employees providing services to the North American Business in November 2009 (excluding for this purpose grants made to Transferred CCE North American Employees), with such grant made in a manner consistent with CCE\'s target award levels, award ranges, and performance adjustment criteria employed in such November 2009 annual equity grant by CCE; provided, however, that (i) TCCC shall have no obligation to replicate the form of award or the terms and conditions of awards granted under CCE Stock Plans, including without limitation the number of shares to be subject to such TCCC equity awards and the vesting conditions and exercise or purchase price of such TCCC equity awards and (ii) TCCC shall not be obligated to make such 2011 equity-based awards to CCE North American Employees if CCE shall have made the CCE 2010 Grant. 

   

 (c) Provided that the Effective Time occurs prior to December 31, 2010, the CCE performance share units granted in 2007 and any other CCE equity award with performance criteria based on growth in earnings per share ("EPS") for the period 2008-2010, and CCE performance share awards having a performance goal relating to EPS achieved by CCE for the year 2010, in any case, held by CCE North American Employees and former CCE North American Employees (the "2010 EPS Awards") shall be eligible to satisfy such EPS performance goals with respect to the year 2010 only as provided in Schedule 3.2(c). It is expressly understood and agreed between the parties that the 

        
  

time-based vesting provisions of the 2010 EPS Awards shall not be modified in
any way by this Section 3.2.

  

 3.3 _2010 Annual Bonus_. 

  

 In the event that the Effective Time occurs during 2010, annual cash incentive compensation for the CCE North American Employees with respect to the year 2010 shall be determined in accordance with CCE\'s 2010 annual bonus program (the "2010 CCE Annual Bonus Program"). The 2010 CCE Annual Bonus Program shall be adopted by CCE in accordance with its past practice, except that such program shall (i) use as a performance measure the 2010 definition of "operating income" set forth on Schedule 3.3 hereto, (ii) include provisions for adjustments of applicable performance goals upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Separation and Merger Agreement, with specific adjustments, including for costs and expenses related to the transactions, to be mutually agreed between TCCC and CCE, and (iii) provide that for CCE North American Employees whose performance measure relates to corporate-wide performance, the annual bonus shall be determined based on corporate-wide performance for the pro rata portion of the bonus relating to the period before the Effective Time, and the performance of the North American Business (excluding the Corporate Segment) for the pro rata portion of the bonus relating to the period after the Effective Time. 

  

 3.4 _Severance_. 

  

 (a) CCE shall be responsible for the severance costs, if any, of any CCE North American Employee arising on and after the Effective Time. CCE shall maintain CCE\'s Executive Severance Plan for not less than 24 months following the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of such plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement. CCE shall not expand the positions eligible for participation in the CCE Executive Severance Plan without the consent of TCCC. For those CCE North American Employees who are not eligible to participate in CCE\'s Executive Severance Plan under the terms of such plan in effect as of the date of this Agreement, TCCC and its Subsidiaries (including but not limited to CCE and the North American Business Subsidiaries) shall pay to any such CCE North American Employee whose position is eligible for benefits under the CCE Employee Severance Plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and whose employment is terminated following the Effective Time through and including December 31, 2011, severance benefits that are substantially comparable to those that would have been provided under the CCE Employee Severance Plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Splitco shall be responsible for the severance costs, if any, of all CCE Other Employees on and after the Effective Time, whether the applicable termination of employment occurs prior to, as of or following the Effective Time. 

  

 3.5 _Retiree Medical Benefits_. 

   

 From the Effective Time through and including December 31, 2011, TCCC shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including but not limited to CCE and the North American Business Subsidiaries) to provide retiree medical benefits to (i) Former CCE Employees (and their eligible spouses and dependents, as applicable) who are as of immediately prior to the Effective Time receiving retiree medical benefits under a CCE Benefit Plan maintained for the benefit of retired CCE North American Employees and (ii) CCE Other Employees who are immediately prior to the Effective Time eligible for such retiree medical benefits under such plans and who elect to receive such benefits immediately following the Effective Time, which benefits shall be substantially comparable to the level of coverage in effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided, that TCCC may increase premiums, co-payments and deductibles at any time and from time to time with respect to retiree medical benefits consistent with CCE\'s past practices and the rate of inflation with respect to the cost of providing health care. Any CCE Other Employee who is not immediately prior to the Effective Time eligible for retiree 

        
  

medical benefits under a CCE Benefit Plan shall not at any time later become
eligible for benefits under any CCE or TCCC retiree medical plan, policy,
program or arrangement.

   

 3.6 _CCE Defined Benefit Pension Plan_. 

  

 CCE shall implement the changes to the CCE Employees\' Pension Plan that were approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of CCE\'s Board of Directors on September 1, 2009, in accordance with such approvals, to be effective January 1, 2011. CCE shall consult with TCCC on all plan details and implementation of such changes as so approved on September 1, 2009. The terms of such amended plan shall be subject to TCCC\'s input, and TCCC shall not unreasonably delay discussions regarding such terms. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any amendment to the CCE Employees\' Pension Plan contemplated by this Section 3.6 limit CCE\'s or TCCC\'s right to amend or modify such plan in any way after December 31, 2011, except to the extent that such limit applies solely as a result of applicable Laws. 

  

 3.7 _Credit for Service_. 

  

 To the extent that a CCE North American Employee commences participation in an employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by TCCC or any TCCC Subsidiary (an "Applicable TCCC Plan") following the Effective Time, TCCC shall, or shall cause CCE or the North American Business Subsidiaries and the Applicable TCCC Plan to: 

  

 (a) credit each CCE North American Employee\'s service with CCE or any predecessor to CCE, to the extent credited under the analogous North American Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time, as service with TCCC for purposes of eligibility and vesting, and for purposes of determining benefits under applicable vacation programs and service awards; and provided, however, that such service credit shall be subject to the applicable terms of any employment agreement; 

  

 (b) in the case of insured arrangements, use its reasonable best efforts to cause its third-party insurance providers to, and in the case of self-insured arrangements, cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under such Applicable TCCC Plan, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would have been waived or satisfied under the analogous North American Benefit Plan in which such CCE North American Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be waived in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs with respect to such CCE North American Employee (and such individual\'s spouse and eligible dependents) who become participants in such Applicable TCCC Plan; and 

  

 (c) give credit for or otherwise take into account under such Applicable TCCC Plan the out-of-pocket expenses and annual expense limitation amounts paid by each CCE North American Employee under the analogous North American Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 In no event shall any CCE North American Employee be entitled to credit for service with CCE or any predecessor to CCE (x) for purposes of determining the level of benefits provided under any Applicable TCCC Plan not specified under clause (a) of this Section 3.7 or (y) under TCCC\'s tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, for purposes of (1) determining years of service or (2) recognition of compensation unless, for purposes of this clause (2), such CCE North American Employee was as of December 31, 2009 eligible for recognition of compensation under such plan. 

  

 3.8 _Represented Employees_. 

  

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the terms and conditions of the employment of CCE North American Employees covered by a collective bargaining Contract shall continue in accordance with the terms of such collective bargaining Contract, and TCCC shall not be required to take, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to take, any action that would violate or breach the terms of any collective bargaining Contract. 

       

                                       
3.9 _Workers\' Compensation_. 

  

 Prior to the Effective Time, CCE and Splitco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill the necessary requirements of each jurisdiction in which the Other CCE Businesses operate with respect to workers\' compensation insurance, including posting surety bonds or purchasing insurance policies and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a release of CCE and any North American Business Subsidiary from any and all obligations in respect of workers\' compensation insurance relating to the Other CCE Businesses. 

   

 3.10 _No Guarantee of Employment_. 

  

 Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting (a) TCCC and its Affiliates (including but not limited to, CCE and the North American Business Subsidiaries following the Effective Time) from terminating the employment of any CCE North American Employee or (b) Splitco and its Affiliates from terminating the employment of any CCE Other Employee, in any case, at any time following the Effective Time and for any or no reason. 

  

 3.11 _Preservation of Rights to Amend or Terminate Plans_. 

  

 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of TCCC, CCE, any North American Business Subsidiary, Splitco or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, whether prior to, as of or following the Effective Time, to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, in accordance with the terms of such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and applicable Laws. Without limiting in any way the generality of the foregoing, TCCC shall not be obligated to continue the CCE Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

  

 3.12 _Cooperation on Employee Communications_. 

  

 Without limiting the generality of any provision in this Agreement or the Separation and Merger Agreement, each of TCCC, CCE and Splitco shall cooperate with the other parties hereto in establishing as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, protocols for communications with the CCE North American Employees concerning the nature of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Separation and Merger Agreement, including without limitation communications with respect to job applications, transfers of employment and the effect of the Separation Transactions and the Merger on employee benefits; provided, that, such protocols shall not limit CCE\'s and Splitco\'s ability to communicate with CCE North American Headquarters Employees concerning transfers of employment and other matters relating to becoming Transferred CCE North American Employees. 

  

 3.13 _CCE Stock Plans_. 

   

 The treatment of outstanding equity previously granted under the CCE Stock Plans shall be governed by the Separation and Merger Agreement and Section 3.2 of this Agreement. 

  

 3.14 _CCE Contributions through the Effective Time_. 

  

 (a) All required contributions to North American Benefit Plans that are defined contribution plans, with respect to employee deferrals and contributions, matching contributions and other contributions for CCE Employees in respect of all periods through the Effective Time, determined in accordance with the terms and provisions of the relevant North American Benefit Plan, ERISA, and the Code, shall be paid by CCE or the relevant Subsidiary of CCE (including without limitation Splitco and its Subsidiaries). Any such contributions that are not made prior to the Effective Time shall be paid to TCCC no later than 15 days following the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) On the Closing Date, TCCC shall pay to CCE (i) the amount specified in Section 4.05 of the Tax Sharing Agreement in respect of the amount of the aggregate 2009 contribution that CCE made to 

        
  

the CCE tax-qualified or registered defined benefit pension plans that are
not "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (the
"Section 3.14 Pension Plans") _less_ (ii) the amount set forth in Schedule
3.14(b). TCCC agrees that CCE shall not be required to fund any contribution
to the Section 3.14 Pension Plans after December 31, 2009 and prior to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Effective Time shall not have occurred prior to the time CCE is required to
make such contributions (or if CCE shall with TCCC\'s prior written consent
make a contribution earlier than as required), the amount specified
in Section 4.05 of the Tax Sharing Agreement shall be adjusted, as provided
in Section 4.05 of the Tax Sharing Agreement, to account for such
contributions. Payments under this Section 3.14(b) shall be made or deemed
made in the manner set forth in Paragraph 7 of Schedule A of the Separation
and Merger Agreement.

 6.1 _Negotiation of Collective Bargaining Agreements_. 

  

 CCE shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, execute, adopt, amend or terminate any collective bargaining Contract without TCCC\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such execution, amendment, adoption or termination (i) relates solely to CCE Other Employees, (ii) results in increased costs over the prior collective bargaining Contract of $5 million or less per 12-month period, or (iii) does not involve the implementation of a new or new participation in a defined benefit pension plan, retiree medical plan, multiemployer pension or welfare plan or severance plan or program.

EXHIBIT IV 
FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT 

  

This Transition Services Agreement (this " _TSA_ ") is by and between The
Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware corporation (" _TCCC_ "), and International
CCE, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Splitco_ "),, and is dated as of [
], 2010.

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Business Separation and Merger Agreement by
and among Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _CCE_
"), Splitco, TCCC and Cobalt Subsidiary LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Merger Sub_ ") dated as of the February [ ], 2010 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), the parties have agreed to enter into this TSA;

  

WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement; and

   

WHEREAS, pursuant to this TSA, TCCC shall provide or cause to be provided
certain services to the Other CCE Businesses, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the terms set
forth herein and the Merger Agreement, as well as other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged
and accepted, and intending to be legally bound hereby, each of TCCC and
Splitco hereby agrees as follows:

   

_1 - Services_

  

 

 a)

 TCCC or one of its Affiliates shall provide Splitco and its Affiliates with the Human Resources, Information Technology and Finance services described in the attachment hereto (the " _Service Schedules_ "),(1) which forms part of this TSA, that had been provided in the ordinary course of business to the Other CCE Businesses by the Corporate Segment or the North American Business (including their respective third party service providers) on or in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Time (the " _Services_ ").  


b)

 TCCC and Splitco shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to negotiate in good faith and execute, on or prior to the Effective Time, a mutually agreeable separate agreement providing that TCCC or one of its Affiliates shall provide Splitco and its Affiliates with the Aviation Services (to be described on a service schedule to such additional agreement and provided in substantially the same level and manner of service as the Services are required to be provided hereunder) that had been provided in the ordinary course of business to the Other CCE Businesses by the Corporate Segment or the North American Business (including their respective third party service providers) on or in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Time.  


c)

 TCCC and Splitco shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to negotiate in good faith and execute, on or prior to the Effective Time, a mutually agreeable separate agreement providing that TCCC or one of its Affiliates shall sublease to Splitco and its Affiliates the 14th and 15th floors at 2500 Windy Ridge Parkway, Atlanta, GA 30339, together with all furniture, equipment, fixtures and appurtenances thereto presently located on such floors in substantially the same condition as at the Effective Time and providing that the rental cost for such sublease shall be charged on a pass through basis.  (1)

 The Service Schedules attached hereto as of the date of the Merger Agreement are provided as a reference to illustrate the type of schedules that the parties anticipate finalizing and shall not be binding on either party. The parties will negotiate in good faith prior to the Effective Time and agree on and memorialize the final binding version of the Service Schedules. 
      

 

 d)

 The Services will be performed consistently with this TSA and in substantially the same manner and with substantially the same level of service and degree of quality as they were provided to the Other CCE Businesses in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Time. If Services are being provided by third party service providers pursuant to an agreement between the Corporate Segment or the North American Business (as applicable) and such third party service provider, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such third party service provider provides the applicable Services in accordance with the terms of such agreement. In addition, the parties will not, and will cause their respective Affiliates not to, amend any such agreement with a third party service provider in a manner that would reasonably be anticipated to have a material impact on the manner in which the Services are provided without first discussing such amendment with the other party in good faith.  


e)

 If, after the date of this TSA, Splitco reasonably determines with the consent of TCCC, not to be unreasonably withheld, that a service was unintentionally omitted from the Service Schedules that (i) was provided by the Corporate Segment or the North American Business (including their respective third party service providers) to the Other CCE Businesses in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Time and (ii) is reasonably necessary to the conduct of the Other CCE Businesses after the Effective Time, then TCCC shall provide such additional service to the Other CCE Businesses (with such service becoming a Service for purposes of this TSA) and a Service Schedule shall be created for such Service.  


f)

 Unless specifically set forth elsewhere herein to the contrary, this TSA does not apply to the services to be provided by TCCC (or any of its subsidiaries) to Splitco (or any of its subsidiaries) pursuant to any other Ancillary Agreement.  


g)

 TCCC is excused from failing to provide Services to the extent such failure is caused by Splitco. 
 

  

_2 - Consents_

  

 

 a)

 TCCC and Splitco will reasonably cooperate together to obtain any third party consents needed for provision of the Services pursuant to Section 6.11 of the Merger Agreement.  

 

 (i)

 TCCC and Splitco shall cooperate to facilitate obtaining any licenses and similar rights to allow Splitco to continue to participate in TCCC system wide master services agreements for information technology hardware and software systems and user applications and other information technology programs in substantially the same manner as had been conducted in the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Time.  


 

b)

 To the extent the parties cannot reasonably obtain such licenses or consents, the parties will work together in good faith and cooperate together pursuant to Section 6.11 of the Merger Agreement to mutually agree on alternative solutions. 
 

  

_3 - Charges_

  

 

 a)

 Splitco will pay TCCC the Service Charges (as defined below) on a calendar monthly basis in arrears, within 30 days of receiving TCCC\'s written monthly invoice to Splitco, unless Splitco in good faith disputes the amount of Service Charges contained in any such invoice within fifteen (15) days following Splitco\'s receipt of such invoice. TCCC\'s written monthly invoices shall set forth the Service Charges (itemized by Service and providing reasonable detail as to the extent of Services provided) and any applicable taxes payable by Splitco for such calendar month. 
 

      

 

 b)

 Unless otherwise specifically agreed and set forth in the Service Schedules, each Service shall be provided on a fixed price basis for the annual charge assigned to each such Service (each, a " _Service Charge_ "). The annual Service Charge will be billed on a pro rata monthly basis in arrears for the Services provided during the month for which the bill is rendered. The annual Service Charge assigned to each Service will be calculated based on the cost for such Service (as shown in the Service Schedules) plus 5% of each such cost(2); except that, notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in the Schedules to the contrary, the portion of third party service provider charges paid by TCCC for Services provided by such third parties to Splitco shall be passed through to Splitco without mark up. If the scope of Services, service levels, or assumptions used to develop the budget or Service Charge change, then the Service Charge will be adjusted in a mutually agreeable manner using the same methodology of cost plus 5% (except for third party pass through charges).  


c)

 If Splitco, in good faith, disputes any Service Charges, it shall promptly submit to TCCC written notice of such dispute within fifteen (15) days following its receipt of the applicable invoice and, if the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) Business Days after delivery of such written notice, Splitco may withhold from its payment of the relevant invoice only such disputed amounts (except for applicable taxes) during the pendency of dispute resolution during the forty-five (45) subsequent Business Days, during which time the chief financial officers of the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. 
 

  

_4 - Term and Termination_

  

 

 a)

 The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the separation and termination of Services as soon as is reasonably feasible, both for individual Services and overall.  


b)

 Unless terminated earlier, and except to the extent that longer or shorter periods are specified for particular Services in the Service Schedules, the Services will continue for one year (365 days) following the Effective Date; _provided_ that Splitco may extend Services for a period of up to six (6) additional months, so long as it provides at least two (2) months written notice prior to the end of the initial one year period.  


c)

 Splitco may terminate any individual Service at the end of any month, so long as it provides at least sixty (60) days prior written notice to TCCC.  


d)

 TCCC may terminate any individual Service if Splitco fails to pay any undisputed Service charges with respect to such Service within thirty (30) days after the due date and such failure is not cured within that period.  


e)

 The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with respect to the transition of Services and documentation following the date of any such termination.  (2)

 The parties shall, between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Date, jointly develop and agree on a budget for provision of each Service during the initial 12 month term of the TSA, together with the set of assumptions relied on by the parties in developing such budget. The final agreed budget shall reflect the cost of providing the Services plus a markup of 5% (other than on the third party pass through charges), which shall in turn constitute the Service Charges. The final agreed budget and assumptions shall be incorporated into the Service Schedules that are binding and effective as of the Effective Time. In the event that the term of the TSA is extended pursuant to Section 4(b), the parties will jointly develop and agree on a revised budget (reflecting the cost of providing the Services plus a markup of 5% other than on the third party pass through charges) and set of assumptions that will govern during any such extension period. 
       

_5 - Confidentiality_

  

 

 a)

 Each party agrees to maintain on a confidential basis the other party\'s confidential information. The obligations in this Section 5 shall survive termination of this TSA or any Services provided hereunder. 
 

  

_6 - Service Separation, Migration and Related Costs_

  

 

 a)

 The parties shall cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to reach mutual agreement on Service separation and migration plans and decisions. TCCC agrees that (i) during the first nine (9) months after the Effective Date, TCCC will not materially reduce the number of personnel providing the Services or add material unrelated responsibilities to the personnel providing the Services, except as mutually agreed by the parties or following Services being terminated pursuant to this TSA; and (ii) thereafter during the term of this TSA, prior to materially reducing the number of personnel providing the Services or adding material unrelated responsibilities to the personnel providing the Services, TCCC will notify Splitco in writing of such planned action and discuss such action with Splitco in good faith; _provided_ that the final decision shall be made by TCCC; and  _provided further_ that nothing in this Section shall relieve TCCC of the obligation to provide the Services in accordance with the standard set forth in  _Section 1(b)_.  


b)

 Except as specifically provided otherwise in this TSA or the Service Schedules, costs related to Contracts and Shared Contracts will be borne as provided in the Merger Agreement. Operational expenses related to separation activities will be shared equally by TCCC and Splitco (50%-50%). All capital expenditures that are temporary in nature and will be used once or a limited number of times, or otherwise not on a continuing basis, during separation will be shared equally by TCCC and Splitco (50%-50%). All capital expenditures that are sustained or ongoing in nature related to separation activities for Splitco will be paid by Splitco. Other costs related to separation of Services pursuant to this TSA will be borne proportionally according to the party whose business the cost directly benefits (e.g., by TCCC to the extent it is for TCCC\'s business, and by Splitco to the extent it is for Splitco\'s business). Each party will bear the respective cost of establishing its own independent stand alone Human Resources, Information Technology and Finance services, including migration and integration. This provision applies only to the specific matters and activities covered by this TSA, and does not apply to any other matters (including those specifically covered by the Merger Agreement or Ancillary Agreements other than this TSA).  


c)

 Splitco and TCCC shall support the activities of their respective transition teams with the intent of enabling the completion of the Service separation and migration plans as soon as practicable. In connection with such support, TCCC shall provide members of Splitco\'s transition team with real-time access to office space and appropriate support staff at the offices of TCCC and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries where Services are being provided pursuant to this TSA and shall permit such members to monitor the provision of Services and the Service separation and migration plans. Such Splitco personnel shall be given full access to all systems and information necessary or appropriate to afford them access to all details concerning the Services provided; _provided_ that Splitco shall ensure that such monitoring activities do not interfere with or impair the provision of the Services to Splitco or the provision of other services to TCCC and its Affiliates; and _provided_ _further_ that Splitco shall ensure that such personnel comply at all times with TCCC\'s and its Affiliates\' policies and procedures in the performance of such monitoring activities. Splitco shall bear all costs and expenses of such Splitco personnel and their monitoring activity. 
 

       

_7 - Indemnification_

  

 

 a)

 Each party (as applicable, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including reasonable out of pocket fees actually incurred for outside counsel, accountants and other outside consultants) suffered or incurred as a result of any third party claim against an Indemnified Party to the extent a result of a material breach of this TSA, including the Service Schedules, by the Indemnifying Party. This provision applies only to the specific matters and activities covered by this TSA, and does not apply to any other matters (including those specifically covered by the Merger Agreement or Ancillary Agreements other than this TSA). 
 

  

_8 - Miscellaneous_

  

 

 a)

I. OBJECT OF THE AGREEMENT

 

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | 1. |  | The Company hereby authorizes the Bottler, and the
Bottler undertakes, upon the following terms and conditions, to prepare and
package the Beverage in such containers as may be approved by the Company in
writing from time to time (hereinafter referred to as "Approved Containers")
and to distribute and sell the same under the Trade Marks, in and throughout

  | 
   | 
  | 
  |

package, distribute or sell, the Beverage in the Territory in any container
other than an Approved Container.  
 

  

 

II. OBLIGATIONS OF THE BOTTLER RELATIVE TO THE MARKETING, PLANNING AND
REPORTING

 

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |

     | 6. |  | The Bottler covenants and agrees with the Company:  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(a) | 
  | 
to make every effort and employ all practicable and approved means to promote,
develop and exploit the full potential of the business of preparing,
packaging, distributing, marketing and selling the Beverage throughout the
Territory by creating, stimulating and expanding continuously the future
demand for the Beverage and by satisfying fully and in all respects the
current demand therefor;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(b) | 
  | 
to prepare, package, distribute and sell such quantities of the Beverage as

Territory; however, with the prior written consent of the Company, the
Bottler may purchase the Beverage in Approved Containers from parties
designated in writing by the Company for resale by the Bottler within the
Territory;  
   
  | 
   | 
  |

the Territory of such manufacturing, warehousing, marketing, distribution,
delivery, transportation and other facilities and equipment as shall be
necessary for the Bottler to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement;  
 

  

      

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
    
  | 
   | 
  | 
(d) | 
  | 
to provide competent and well-trained management and recruit, train, maintain
and direct all personnel required, sufficient in every respect to perform all
of the obligations of the Bottler under this Agreement;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(e) | 
  | 
to deliver to the Company once in each calendar year a program or plan in
writing acceptable to the Company as to form and substance and in accordance
with the Bottler\'s obligations under this Agreement, showing in detail the
activities of the Bottler contemplated for the ensuing twelve-month period or
such other period as the Company may prescribe, to prosecute such program or
plan diligently, and to deliver to the Company upon its request written
reports of the progress of the work in an acceptable form;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(f) | 
  | 
to report to the Company accurate and current information on production,
distribution and sales of the Beverage at such intervals, in such detail and
in such form as may be requested by the Company;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(g) | 
  | 
to maintain accurate books, accounts and records and to provide to the Company
such financial, accounting and other information as the Company may request to
enable the Company to determine whether the Bottler is maintaining the

obligations under this Agreement and in recognition of the Company\'s interest
in maintaining, promoting and safeguarding the overall performance, efficiency
and integrity of the bottling, distribution and sales system;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(h) | 
  | 
not to sell and/or distribute the Beverage, without the prior written consent
of the Company, outside the Territory or to anyone who intends to resell the
Beverage outside the Territory; the foregoing prohibition does not apply if
the Territory is a Member State or within a Member State of the European
Economic Area and the sale results from an order from a customer in another
Member State or for export to another Member State; and  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(i) | 
  | 
not to actively seek customers nor maintain a branch outside the Territory;
however, the Bottler shall have the right to fill unsolicited orders for the
Beverage from any customer located within another Member State or for export
to another Member State of the European Economic Area.  
   
  | 
7. | 
  | 
The Bottler must, for its own account, budget and expend such funds for
advertising, marketing and promoting the Beverage as may be reasonably
required by the Company to create, stimulate and sustain the demand for
the Beverage in the Territory, provided that the Bottler shall submit all
advertising, marketing and promotional projects relating to the Trade Marks or
the Beverage to the Company for its prior approval, and shall use, publish,
maintain or distribute only such advertising, marketing or promotional
material relating to the Trade Marks or the Beverage as the Company shall
approve and authorize. The Company may agree from time to time and subject to
such terms and conditions as it shall stipulate in each case to contribute
financially to the Bottler\'s marketing programs. The Company may also
undertake, at its own expense and independently from the Bottler, any
additional advertising or sales promotion activities in the Territory it deems
useful or appropriate.  
   
  | 
8. | 
  | 
(a) | 
  | 
The Bottler recognizes that the Company has entered into or may enter into
agreements similar to this Agreement with other parties outside the Territory
and accepts the limitations such agreements may reasonably impose on the
Bottler in the conduct of its business under this Agreement. The Bottler
further agrees to conduct its business in such a manner so as to avoid
conflicts with such other parties, and, in the event of disputes nevertheless
arising with such other parties, to make every reasonable effort to settle
them amicably.  
 

  

      

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
    
  | 
   | 
  | 
(b) | 
  | 
The Bottler will not oppose any additional actions the adoption of which are
considered by the Company as necessary and justified in order to protect and
improve the sales and distribution system for the Beverage, including, but
not limited to, those actions which might be adopted concerning the supply of
large and/or special customers whose field of activity transcends the
boundaries of the Territory, even if such actions should limit the Bottler\'s
rights under this Agreement, including measures taken in compliance with the
Rules of Competition of the European Union.  
   
  | 
9. | 
  | 
The Bottler, recognizing the important benefit to itself and all the other
parties referred to in Clause 8(a) above, of a uniform external appearance of
the distribution and other equipment and materials used under this Agreement,
agrees to accept and apply the standards adopted and issued from time to time
by the Company for the design and decoration of trucks and other delivery
vehicles, cases, cartons, coolers, vending machines and other materials
and equipment used in the distribution and sale of the Beverage.  
   
  | 
10. | 
  | 
The Bottler acknowledges and agrees that the broadest possible direct
distribution and sale of the Beverage to retail outlets and final consumers in
the Territory is an essential element in satisfying fully the demand for the
Beverage pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the recognized advantages
of direct distribution, the Bottler shall be authorized to distribute and sell
the Beverage to wholesalers in the Territory who sell only to retail outlets
in the Territory. Any other methods of distribution shall be subject to the
prior written consent of the Company.  
   
  | 
11. | 
  | 
(a) | 
  | 
In the event any of the Beverage prepared, packaged, distributed or sold by
the Bottler is found within the territory of another authorized bottler or
authorized distributor within a state that is not a Member State of the
European Economic Area (hereinafter referred to as the "Injured Bottler"),
then, in addition to all other remedies available to the Company:  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
  | 
  | 
(1) | 
  | 
if the phenomenon persists or reoccurs after the Company has requested the
Bottler, in writing, to end or prevent it, by discharging the Bottler\'s
obligation under Clauses 6(h) and (i), the Company may, in its sole
discretion, cancel forthwith the approval for the container(s) of the type
which were found in the Injured Bottler\'s territory;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
  | 
  | 
(2) | 
  | 
the Company may charge the Bottler an amount of compensation for the Beverage
found in the Injured Bottler\'s territory, to include all lost profits,
expenses and other costs incurred by the Company and the Injured Bottler;
and  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
  | 
  | 
(3) | 
  | 
the Company may purchase any of the Beverage prepared, packaged, distributed
or sold by the Bottler which is found in the Injured Bottler\'s territory, and
the Bottler shall, in addition to any other obligation it may have under this
Agreement, reimburse the Company for the Company\'s cost of purchasing,
transporting and/or destroying such Beverage.  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(b) | 
  | 
In the event the Beverage prepared, packaged, distributed or sold by the
Bottler is found in the territory of an Injured Bottler, the Bottler shall
make available to representatives of the Company all sales agreements and
other records relating to the Beverage and assist the Company in all
investigations relating to the sale and distribution of the Beverage outside
the Territory.  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(c) | 
  | 
The Bottler shall immediately inform the Company if at any time any
solicitation or offer to purchase the Beverage is made to the Bottler by a
third party which the Bottler knows or has reason to believe or suspect would
result in the Beverage being marketed, sold, resold, distributed or
redistributed outside the Territory in breach of this Agreement.  
 

  

      

 

III. OBLIGATIONS OF BOTTLER RELATIVE TO THE TRADE MARKS

 

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | 12. |  | The Bottler will at all times recognize the validity
and ownership of the Trade Marks by The Coca-Cola Company and will not at any
time put in issue the validity and ownership of the Trade Marks.  
   
  | 
13. | 
  | 
Nothing herein shall give the Bottler any interest in the Trade Marks or the
goodwill attaching thereto or in any label, design, container or other visual
representations thereof, or used in connection therewith; and the Bottler
acknowledges and agrees that all rights and interest created through such
usage of the Trade Marks, labels, designs, containers or other visual
representations shall inure to the benefit and be the property of The Coca-
Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company and the Bottler agree and understand that
there is extended to the Bottler under this Agreement a mere temporary
permission, uncoupled with any right or interest, and without payment of any
fee or royalty charge, to use said Trade Marks, labels, designs, containers
or other visual representations thereof, in connection with the preparation,
packaging, distribution and sale of the Beverage in Approved Containers; said
use to be in such manner and with the result that all goodwill relating to
the same shall accrue to The Coca-Cola Company as the source and origin of
such Beverage, and the Company shall be absolutely entitled to determine in
every instance the manner of presentation and such other steps necessary
or desirable to secure compliance with this Clause 13.  
   
  | 
14. | 
  | 
The Bottler shall not adopt or use any name, corporate name, trading name,
title of establishment or other commercial designation which includes the
words "Coca-Cola", "Coca", "Cola", "Coke", or any of them, or any name that
is confusingly similar to any of them, or any graphic or visual representation
of the Trade Marks or any other trade mark or intellectual property owned by
The Coca-Cola Company, without the prior written consent of The Coca-
Cola Company.

   | 
  | 
(a) | 
  | 
not to manufacture, prepare, package, distribute, sell, deal in or otherwise
be concerned with any product associated with any trade dress or any container
that is an imitation of a trade dress or container in which the Company

confusion or be perceived by consumers as confusingly similar to or be passed
off as such trade dress or container;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(b) | 
  | 
not to manufacture, prepare, package, distribute, sell, deal in or otherwise
be concerned with any product associated with any trade mark or other
designation which is an imitation or infringement of any of the Trade Marks
or is likely to cause passing-off of any product which is intended to lead the
public to believe that it originates with the Company because of the
Bottler\'s association with the business of manufacturing, preparing,
packaging, distributing and selling the Beverage; without in any way limiting
the generality of the foregoing, it is hereby expressly understood and
stipulated that use of the word "Coca" or local language or phonetic
equivalent in any form or fashion, or any word graphically or phonetically
similar thereto or in imitation thereof, on any product other than that of The
Coca-Cola Company would constitute an infringement of the trade mark "Coca-
Cola" or be likely to cause passing-off;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(c) | 
  | 
not to use delivery vehicles, cases, cartons, coolers, vending machines and

termination not to manufacture, prepare, package, distribute, sell, deal in or
otherwise be concerned with any other concentrate, beverage base, syrup or
beverage which is likely to be confused with or passed off for the
Concentrate, Syrup or Beverage; and  
 

  

      

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |  |  |

not to acquire or hold, directly or indirectly, any ownership interest in, or
enter into any contract or arrangement with respect to the management or
control of any person or legal entity, within or outside of the Territory,

  | 
   | 
  |

partnership, agreement or otherwise, and whether located within or outside of
the Territory.

  | 
It is understood and agreed among the parties that in the event that either:  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(a) | 
  | 
a third party which is in the opinion of the Company directly or indirectly
through ownership, control, management or otherwise, concerned with the
manufacture, preparation, packaging, distribution or sale of any product
specified in Clause 15 hereof shall acquire or otherwise obtain control or any
direct or indirect influence on the management of the Bottler; or  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(b) | 
  | 
any person, firm or company having majority ownership or direct or indirect
control of the Bottler or who is directly or indirectly controlled either by

influence in the opinion of the Company on the management of the Bottler,
shall engage in the preparation, packaging, distribution or sale of any
products specified in Clause 15 hereof;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
then the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement forthwith
without liability for damages unless the third party making such acquisition
referred to in subclause (a) hereof or the person, firm or company referred
to in subclause (b) hereof shall, on being notified in writing by the Company
of its intention to terminate as aforesaid, agrees to discontinue, and shall
in fact discontinue, the manufacture, preparation, packaging, distribution or
sale of such product(s) within a reasonable period not exceeding six (6)

Containers, closures, cases, cartons, labels and other packaging materials to

  | 
20. | 
  | 
(a) | 
  | 
The Bottler recognizes that increases in the demand for the Beverage, as well
as changes in the Approved Containers, may from time to time require
modifications or other changes in respect of its existing

VII. OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THE BOTTLER

 

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
     | 27. |  | It is recognized and acknowledged among the parties
hereto that the Company has a vested and legitimate interest in maintaining,
promoting and safeguarding the overall performance, efficiency and integrity
of the Company\'s international bottling, distribution and sales system. It
is further recognized and acknowledged among the parties hereto that this
Agreement has been entered into by the Company intuitu personae and in
reliance upon the identity, character and integrity of the owners,
controlling parties and managers of the Bottler, and the Bottler warrants
having made to the Company prior to the execution hereof a full and complete
disclosure of the owners and of any third parties having a right to, or power
of, control or management of the Bottler. It is therefore agreed among the
parties hereto that notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 16 or any other
provision of this Clause 27, in the event of any change, due to any cause, of
the real persons or legal entities having direct or indirect ownership or
control of the Bottler, including any changes of the share-owner composition
of such entities, the Company, in its sole discretion, may terminate this
Agreement forthwith and without liability for damages. The Bottler,
therefore, covenants and agrees:  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(a) | 
  | 
not to assign, transfer, pledge or in any way encumber this Agreement or any
interest herein or rights hereunder, in whole or in part, to any third party
or parties without the prior written consent of the Company;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(b) | 
  | 
not to delegate performance of this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any
third party or parties without the prior written consent of the Company;  
 

  

      

 

      

   

   |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
    
  | 
   | 
  | 
(c) | 
  | 
to notify the Company promptly in the event of or upon obtaining knowledge of
any third party action which may or will result in any change in the ownership
or control of the Bottler;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(d) | 
  | 
to make available from time to time and at the request of the Company complete
records of current ownership of the Bottler and full information concerning
any third party or parties by whom it is controlled, directly or
indirectly;  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(e) | 
  | 
to the extent the Bottler has any legal control over changes in the ownership
or control of the Bottler, not to initiate or implement, consent to or
acquiesce in any such change without the prior written consent of the
Company; and  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
(f) | 
  | 
if the Bottler is organized as a partnership, not to change the composition of
such partnership by the inclusion of any new partners or the release of
existing partners without the prior written consent of the Company.  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
In addition to the foregoing provisions of this Clause 27, if a proposed
change in ownership or control of the Bottler involves a direct or indirect
transfer to or acquisition of ownership or control of the Bottler,  in whole
or in part, by a person or entity authorized by the Company to manufacture,
sell, distribute or otherwise deal in any beverage products and/or any Trade
Marks of the Company (the "Acquiror Bottler"), the Company may request any and
all information it considers relevant from both the Bottler and the Acquiror
Bottler in order to make its determination as to whether to consent to such
change. In any such circumstances, the parties hereto, recognizing and
acknowledging the vested and legitimate interest of the Company in
maintaining, promoting and safeguarding the overall performance, efficiency
and integrity of the Company\'s international bottling, distribution and sales
system, expressly agree that the Company may consider all and any factors,
and apply any criteria that it considers relevant in making such
determination.  
   
  | 
   | 
  | 
It is further recognized and agreed among the parties hereto that the Company,
in its sole discretion, may withhold consent to any proposed change in
ownership or other transaction contemplated in this Clause 27, or may consent
subject to such conditions as the Company, in its sole discretion, may
determine. The parties hereto expressly stipulate and agree that any violation
by the Bottler of the foregoing covenants contained in this Clause 27
shall entitle the Company to terminate this Agreement forthwith without
liability for damages; and, furthermore, in view of the personal nature of
this Agreement, that the Company shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement without liability for damages if any other third party or parties
should obtain any direct or indirect interest in the ownership or control of
the Bottler, even when the Bottler had no means to prevent such a change, if,
in the opinion of the Company, such change either enables such third party or
parties to exercise a decisive influence over the management of the Bottler or
materially alters the ability of the Bottler to comply fully with the terms,
obligations and conditions of this Agreement.  
   
  | 
28. | 
  | 
The Bottler shall, prior to the issue, offer, sale, transfer, trade or
exchange of any of its shares of stock or other evidence of ownership, its
bonds, debentures or other evidence of indebtedness, or the promotion of the
sale of the above, or stimulation or solicitation of the purchase or an offer
to sell thereof, obtain the written consent of the Company whenever the
Bottler uses in this connection the name of the Company or the Trade Marks or
any description of the business relationship with the Company in any
prospectus, advertisement or other sales efforts. The Bottler shall not use
the name of the Company or the Trade Marks or any description of the business
relationship with the Company in any prospectus or advertisement used in
connection with the Bottler\'s acquisition of any shares or other evidence of
ownership in a third party without the Company\'s prior written consent.

The Bottler shall obtain and maintain a policy of insurance with insurance
carriers satisfactory to the Company giving full and comprehensive coverage
both as to amount and risks covered in respect of matters referred to in

the Bottler from its obligations under Clause 32(b) hereof.  
   
  | 
33. | 
  | 
The Bottler covenants and agrees:

competent regulatory authority or court, in which it is alleged that the

the good name, reputation and image of The Coca-Cola Company and the Trade
Marks. In order to address such incidents, including but not limited to any
questions of quality of the Beverage that may occur, the Bottler will
designate and organize an incident management team and inform the Company of
the members of such team. The Bottler further agrees to cooperate fully with
the Company and such third parties as the Company may designate and coordinate

procedures for crisis management that may be issued to the Bottler by the
Company from time to time.

In the event of any provisions of this Agreement being or becoming legally

performance hereunder or prejudice the ownership or validity of the Trade
Marks. The right to terminate in accordance with Clause 24(a)(2) is not
affected hereby.
