SEPARATION AND MERGER AGREEMENT, dated as of February&nbsp;25, 2010 (this "<U>Agreement</U>"), by and among COCA-COLA

</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
in addition to its other businesses, CCE is engaged, directly and through certain of its Subsidiaries, in (x)&nbsp;the marketing, production, and distribution of nonalcoholic
beverages in the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands ("<U>North American Territory</U>") and (y)&nbsp;the
functions and operations of CCE's "corporate operating segment" (as defined in CCE's Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009)
("<U>Corporate Segment</U>") ((x) and (y)&nbsp;collectively, the "<U>North American Business</U>"); </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
Splitco is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCE; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
CCE desires to restructure its business so that the business of marketing, production and distribution of non-alcoholic beverages outside the North American
Territory and all equity interests directly or indirectly owned by it in entities engaged in businesses other than the North
American Business (collectively, the "<U>Other CCE Businesses</U>") shall be owned, directly or indirectly, by Splitco; </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
at or prior to the Closing (as defined herein) of the transactions contemplated hereby the parties will execute the separation transactions as more fully described in
<U>Schedule&nbsp;A</U> attached hereto (collectively other than paragraphs&nbsp;9, 10 and 11, the "<U>Separation Transactions</U>"); </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
TCCC desires to acquire CCE and the North American Business; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the respective boards of directors of each of TCCC and CCE, and the sole managing member of Merger Sub, have (i)&nbsp;approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into CCE (the
"<U>Merger</U>"), with CCE as the surviving corporation (CCE, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "<U>Surviving
Corporation</U>") pursuant to which (A)&nbsp;each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of CCE (the "<U>CCE Common Stock</U>"), other than the Excluded
Shares, will be converted automatically into the right to receive (1)&nbsp;1.000 share of Splitco Common Stock and (2)&nbsp;$10.00 in cash, without interest (funds for which will be comprised of
cash on hand and/or funds borrowed by Splitco and distributed to CCE), and (B)&nbsp;each outstanding membership interest of Merger Sub ("<U>Merger Sub Membership Interest</U>")
shall be converted into a share of the Surviving Corporation, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii)&nbsp;approved and declared advisable this
Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the board of directors of CCE (the "<U>CCE Board</U>") and the Affiliated Transaction Committee have, in each case, determined that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the best interests of CCE's stockholders (other than TCCC and its Affiliates) and the CCE Board has resolved to recommend the adoption of this
Agreement to CCE's stockholders; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,

Act) as required by Rule&nbsp;13a-15 under the Exchange Act. CCE's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that all material information
required to be disclosed by CCE in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to CCE's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Section&nbsp;302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. CCE adheres to and enforces a system of internal control over financial reporting which is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that
(i)&nbsp;require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the Transactions and dispositions of the assets of CCE and its Subsidiaries, (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that Transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of CCE and its Subsidiaries
are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and, if required, the CCE Board and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Assets of CCE and its Subsidiaries. CCE's management has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of CCE's internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Except as set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;4.7</U> of the CCE Disclosure Letter, neither CCE, nor to the Knowledge of CCE, CCE's independent auditors has identified or
been made aware of (A)&nbsp;any significant deficiency or material weakness, in each case which has not been subsequently remediated, in the system of internal control over financial reporting

retiree medical plan, agreement or arrangement, regardless of whether or not such plans, agreements or arrangements are material North American Benefit Plans. With respect to the North American
Benefit Plans set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;4.14(a)</U> of the CCE Disclosure Letter, CCE has delivered or made available to TCCC true, correct and complete copies of,
(i)&nbsp;each North American Benefit Plan (or, in each case, descriptions thereof for any unwritten North American Benefit Plans), (ii)&nbsp;the most recent annual report on Form&nbsp;5500

Benefit Plan, and (iv)&nbsp;each trust agreement and insurance or group annuity contract related to any North American Benefit Plan. Each CCE Benefit Plan that is subject to Section&nbsp;302 or
Title IV of ERISA or Section&nbsp;412 of the Code is hereinafter referred to in this <U>Section&nbsp;4.14</U> as a "<U>Title IV Plan</U>." </FONT></P>

the right of CCE or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, TCCC or any of its Subsidiaries, to merge, amend or terminate any of the North American

American Benefit Plans. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as would not have a North American Business Material Adverse Effect, no liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by CCE or any ERISA Affiliate that has
not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a risk to CCE or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability, other than potential future withdrawal liability under a
multiemployer pension plan (as defined in Section&nbsp;4001(a)(3) of ERISA) for a withdrawal after the Effective Time and, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("<U>PBGC</U>") (which premiums have been paid when due). Each Title IV Plan and any trust established thereunder has satisfied the "minimum funding standard" under
Section&nbsp;412 of the Code, whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the date hereof. </FONT></P>

of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder without proof of actual damages and without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond. Such remedy shall not be deemed
