a dispute arising in connection with the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount or relating to the Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation within the Initial Resolution Period, either party may submit such dispute to, and such dispute shall be
resolved fully, finally and exclusively through the use of PricewaterhouseCoopers, or a firm of nationally recognized independent public accountants in the United States reasonably acceptable to each of Holdco and the Shareholder Representative if
PricewaterhouseCoopers shall have a material conflict of interest at the time (the &#147;<U>Independent Accounting Firm</U>&#148;). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm incurred in the resolution of such dispute shall be borne by
the parties in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Participating Rights Holders and Holdco from the resolution of the dispute. For example, if the Shareholder Representative challenges the calculation
of the Closing Adjustment Amount in the Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation by an amount of $100,000, but the Independent Accounting Firm determines that the Participating Rights Holders have a valid claim for only $40,000, Holdco shall bear 40%
of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Participating Rights Holders) shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses. All other fees and expenses incurred by a party in
connection with the Closing Adjustment Amount shall be borne by the party incurring such cost. Any dispute resolution proceeding shall be commenced within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the expiration of the Initial Resolution Period. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall determine (and written notice thereof shall be given to the Shareholder Representative and Holdco) as promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60)&nbsp;days following its appointment, based solely on written
submissions detailing the disputed items submitted to it by both parties, only (x)&nbsp;whether the Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation, and Holdco&#146;s calculation of the adjusted Closing Adjustment Amount were prepared in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and (y)&nbsp;with respect to the disputed items submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm, whether and to what extent (if any) the Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement, the Holdco Closing Adjustment
Calculation or the Closing Adjustment Amount require adjustment together with a written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required adjustment, including the basis therefor, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make no other
determinations or calculations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not be entitled to impose penalties or interest on any party. All negotiations pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.5(e)(iii)</U> shall be treated as

resolution proceedings under this <U>Section&nbsp;1.5(e)(iii)</U>, shall be treated as confidential information. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement. The procedures of this
<U>Section&nbsp;1.5(e)(iii)</U> are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.5(e)(iii)</U> may

Mitral Purchase Agreement) is being exercised by Valor with respect to all Interests in Mitral held by the Founders; and (iii)&nbsp;specify, based on the Company Valuation, the aggregate consideration to be paid to the Founders in respect of the
Call Option (the &#147;<U>Founders&#146; Portion</U>&#148;), which consideration shall be deducted from the Merger Consideration payable hereunder pursuant to the terms hereof solely to the extent such payment is due to the Founders in respect of
the Call Option. At any time prior to the ISR Effective Time, Valor may exchange any Interests in Mitral held by the Founders for shares of Valor Capital Stock. In the event of any such exchange, any such Founder that receives shares of Valor
Capital Stock in exchange for Interests in Mitral shall be deemed to be a Participating Rights Holder for all purposes hereunder and under any Related Agreement and the Founders&#146; Portion shall be proportionately reduced. At the ISR Effective
Time, Holdco shall, on behalf of Valor, deliver and issue the Deducted Closing Holdco Shares and the Deducted Warrants to the Founders, on a pro rata basis based on each such Founder&#146;s ownership percentage as of immediately prior to the ISR
Effective Time of all Interests in Mitral (on a fully diluted basis) outstanding as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time. Concurrently with the payment of any Contingent Payment to any Participating Rights Holder, Holdco shall pay the
Founders&#146; Portion of such Contingent Payment to the Founders, on a pro rata basis based on each such Founder&#146;s ownership percentage as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time of all Interests in Mitral (on a fully diluted basis)
outstanding as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time. Any payments due to the Founders hereunder shall be deposited with the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, to hold and distribute pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
the Exchange Agent Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable. In the event that any portion of the foregoing consideration paid to the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent on behalf of a Founder is subject to an attachment imposed by a court
(the &#147;<U>Attached Consideration</U>&#148;), the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall not release the Attached Consideration except pursuant to such court&#146;s instructions or pursuant to a settlement agreement entered as a
judgment before such court. For the avoidance of doubt, Holdco shall have satisfied its payment obligations in respect of the Attached Consideration upon release thereof by the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent in compliance with the immediately
preceding sentence. Valor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Founder to seek court approval for the transfer of the Interests in Mitral which are the subject of the Attached Consideration. </P>
