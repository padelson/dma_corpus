1 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of ISR Merger Sub has determined that (a) the
ISR Merger and the other Transactions are consistent with, and will further,
the business strategies and goals of ISR Merger Sub and are in the best
interests of ISR Merger Sub and its shareholder, (b) that, considering the
financial position of the merging companies, no reasonable concern exists
that the ISR Surviving Company will be unable to fulfill its obligations to
its creditors, and (c) has approved this Agreement and the Transactions,

shareholder of ISR Merger Sub adopt this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in order to induce HW to enter into this Agreement and to cause the
ISR Merger, the US Merger and the other Transactions to be consummated,
certain officers and directors of Valor and certain Valor Shareholders, in
each case, listed on _Schedule A_ hereto, are executing (i) support
agreements in favor of Holdco concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the "
_Shareholder Support Agreements_ "), and (ii) stockholder voting agreements
with Holdco, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and effective as the Closing (as defined below), substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ (the " _Stockholders Voting Agreements_ ");

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend for the US Merger and the ISR Merger,
taken together, to qualify as an exchange satisfying the requirements of
Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
and/or for the US Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code; and

WHEREAS, it is expected that within fifteen (15) days after the Form S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, Valor
will hold a general meeting of the Valor Shareholders to obtain the Required
Valor Shareholder Vote.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, HW,
Valor, Holdco, ISR Merger Sub or US Merger Sub and the Shareholder
Representative hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE ISR MERGER

1.1 _The ISR Merger_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including those set forth in  _Article 9_ hereof, the ISR Merger
shall be consummated under the following circumstances:

(a) _The ISR Merger_. Upon the terms hereof and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with Israeli Companies Law, at the Closing,
ISR Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Valor and, as a result of the ISR
Merger, the separate corporate existence of ISR Merger Sub shall cease, and
Valor shall continue as the surviving company (the " _ISR Surviving Company_
").

(b)  _Consummation of the ISR Merger; Closing Date_. Subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of all of the conditions contained in _Article 9_ , as
soon as is reasonably practicable on or prior to the second (2nd) business day
following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions contained in
_Article 9_ , other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, or at such later or earlier date as may be mutually
agreed upon by Valor and HW, a 

 



2  closing of the US Merger and the ISR Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will be held
at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP at 200 Clarendon Street, Boston,
Massachusetts (or at such other location and date as the parties may mutually
agree upon in writing). The date on which the Closing is actually held is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." ISR Merger Sub and Valor shall,
and Holdco shall cause ISR Merger Sub to, cause the ISR Merger to be
consummated on the Closing Date by requesting that the Registrar of Companies
of the State of Israel (the " _Companies Registrar_ ") provide the ISR
Surviving Company with the Certificate of Merger on the Closing Date in
accordance with Section 323(5) of the Israeli Companies Law (the " _ISR Merger
Certificate_ "). The ISR Merger shall be effective on the Closing Date, or at
such other time as HW and Valor shall agree (the " _ISR Effective Time_ ").
For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties that the ISR
Merger shall be declared effective and that the issuance by the Companies
Registrar of the ISR Merger Certificate in accordance with Section 323(5) of
the Israeli Companies Law shall both occur on the Closing Date.

 

1.2 _Effect of the ISR Merger_. At the ISR Effective Time, the effect of the
ISR Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and as provided by the
applicable provisions of the Israeli Companies Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto and to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 9_ , by virtue of,
and simultaneously with the consummation of the ISR Merger, at the ISR
Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the parties or
any shareholder of Valor, (i) all properties (including, but not limited to,
Intellectual Property and licenses to Intellectual Property), rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Valor and ISR Merger Sub shall vest in
the ISR Surviving Company in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, (ii)
all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
Valor and ISR Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the ISR Surviving Company in
accordance with the Israeli Companies Law, (iii) all the rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of Valor (as the ISR Surviving Company)
shall continue unaffected by the ISR Merger in accordance with the Israeli
Companies Law, and (iv) the ISR Surviving Company shall become a
Subsidiary of Holdco, continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of
Israel and maintain a registered office in the State of Israel.

1.3  _Articles of Association and Memorandum of Association_. Simultaneously
with the ISR Effective Time, Holdco and HW, in their capacity as sole
shareholders of the ISR Surviving Company, shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions required to adopt Amended and Restated Articles of
Association in the form of _Exhibit I_ hereto (the " _Amended Articles_ ") and
such Amended Articles shall be the Articles of Association of the ISR
Surviving Company from and after the ISR Effective Time until further amended
in accordance with applicable law.

1.4 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of ISR Merger Sub immediately
prior to the ISR Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the ISR
Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the Amended Articles
of the ISR Surviving Company and the Israeli Companies Law, and until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until their
earlier death, disability, resignation or removal. The officers of ISR Merger
Sub immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time shall be the initial officers
of the ISR Surviving Company, in each case until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
disability, resignation or removal.

 



3 1.5 _Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement; Closing
Adjustment Amount; Escrow; Representative Reimbursement Amount_.

(a) _Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement_.

 

(i) On the third (3rd) business day prior to the Closing, Valor shall prepare
and deliver to HW and Holdco a statement (the " _Capitalization and Closing
Adjustment Amount Statement_ ") that sets forth (with respect to clauses (C)
through (F) below, Valors good-faith estimates of):

 

(A) the information required to be set forth on _Section 4.3(b) of the Valor
Disclosure Schedule_, as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time,
subject to the exercise of any Valor Options or Valor Warrants by the holders
thereof prior to the ISR Effective Time;

 

(B) the Aggregate Exercise Amount;

 

(C) the respective amounts (and payees thereof, including wire transfer
instructions for such payees) of (i) all unpaid third party fees, costs or
expenses incurred or expected to be incurred prior to or at the ISR Effective
Time by Valor (or for which Valor will be responsible) in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions (including any fees and expenses of legal
counsel, financial advisors and consultants, whether or not invoiced or billed
prior to the ISR Effective Time, and whether incurred on behalf of Valor or to
the extent payable by Valor on behalf of the Participating Rights Holders),
and (ii) the premium payable for the Tail DandO Policy to the extent greater
than 250% of the annual payment for Valors and its Subsidiaries
existing directors and officers insurance policies (clauses (i) and (ii),
collectively, the " _Transaction Costs_ ");

 

(D) the amount (the " _Indebtedness Amount_ ") of any Indebtedness of Valor
outstanding as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time;

(E) the aggregate amount of any Change in Control Payments; and

 

(F) Valors calculation of the estimated Closing Adjustment Amount and the
Aggregate Closing Holdco Shares.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that a cost, expense or other
amount is included in the definition of Transaction Costs or the Indebtedness
Amount, it shall only be counted once, to avoid multiple deductions for the
same cost, expense or other amount.

 

(iii) The disclosures contemplated by _Section 1.5(a)(i)(A)_ in the
Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement shall be deemed to be
representations and warranties of Valor hereunder made as of immediately prior
to the ISR Effective Time. During the period from the delivery of the
Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement from Valor to HW and
Holdco and prior to the Closing, Valor shall

 



4  provide HW and its Representatives with reasonable access to the books of
account and records of Valor used to prepare the Capitalization and Closing
Adjustment Amount Statement and the management of Valor for the purpose of
assisting HW and its Representatives in their review of the amounts set forth
therein. In the event of any disagreements between Valor and HW relating to
any of the information included in or reflected on the Capitalization and
Closing Adjustment Amount Statement, Valor and HW shall negotiate in good
faith to reconcile any such disagreements (it being understood that if any
such disagreements are not resolved by the ISR Effective Time, the
Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement prepared by Valor, as
revised to reflect any revisions thereto agreed by the parties prior to the
ISR Effective Time, but not any of HWs or Holdcos comments not agreed to by
Valor, shall be the Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement).
In no event shall any such disagreements prevent or delay the Closing.

(b)  _Escrowed Shares_. At the Closing, Holdco shall deposit 440,000 Holdco
Common Shares (subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.5_), unless the
CE Mark Milestone is achieved prior to the Closing Date, in which case Holdco
shall deposit 520,000 Holdco Common Shares (subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.5_) (the " _Escrowed Shares_ "), into an escrow account (the "
_Escrow Account_ ") to be established and maintained by U.S. Bank, N.A. (the
" _Escrow Agent_ "). At or prior to the Closing, the Escrow Agent, Holdco and
the Shareholder Representative shall enter into an escrow agreement (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ ") substantially in the form of  _Exhibit L_ attached
hereto with such changes that are reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent and
agreed to by HW and Valor. The Escrowed Shares shall constitute security
solely for the indemnification and Final Closing Adjustment
Amount obligations of the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders
pursuant to _Article 11_ and _Section 1.5(e)(iv)_, respectively, and shall be
held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. The Escrow Agreement shall provide that
any Escrowed Shares remaining in the Escrow Account on the Escrow Release Date
and not distributed or distributable to the Shareholder Representative in
accordance with  _Section 3.7(c)_ or subject to a pending indemnification
claim pursuant to _Article 11_ shall be released to the Exchange Agent for
distribution to the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders in
accordance with each such Persons Pro Rata Share. All fees and expenses of
the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement shall be borne by Holdco.

(c)  _Representative Reimbursement Amount_. A number of Holdco Common Shares
equal to $1,000,000 _divided by_ the Signing Date Price, rounded down to the
nearest whole share (the " _Initial Representative Reimbursement Amount_
," together with any additional amounts deposited made with the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the " _Representative Reimbursement
Amount_ "), shall be deducted from the Aggregate Closing Holdco Shares, and
issued by Holdco to the Shareholder Representative or a designee thereof,
free and clear of any restrictions on transfer other than those provided under
applicable Law, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, to be held
by or on behalf of the Shareholder Representative for the payment of expenses
incurred by the Shareholder Representative in performing its duties pursuant
to this Agreement or any engagement agreement between Participating Rights
Holders and/or the Founders, on the one hand, and the Shareholder
Representative, on the other hand (a " _Representative Engagement Agreement_
").

 



5 (d) _Closing Payment Allocation Schedule_. Prior to the Closing, Valor shall
deliver to HW and Holdco a schedule (the " _Closing Payment Allocation
Schedule_ ") setting forth, for each Participating Rights Holder and each of
the Founders, as applicable:

 

(i) such Persons name, and, to Knowledge of Valor as of the date of delivery,
such Persons address and email address;

(ii) the number of Valor Ordinary Shares held by such Participating Rights
Holder as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time;

(iii) the number and series of Valor Preferred Shares held by such
Participating Rights Holder as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective
Time;

(iv) with respect to each holder of a Valor Option, whether such holder is
an employee of Valor as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time;

(v) the number of Valor Ordinary Shares subject to each Valor Option held by
each holder of a Valor Option (and the exercise price of such Valor Option) as
of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time;

 

(vi) the number of Valor Ordinary Shares or Valor Preferred Shares subject to
each Valor Warrant held by each holder of a Valor Warrant (and the exercise
price of such Valor Warrant) as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective
Time;

(vii) the number of Closing Holdco Shares, Deducted Closing Holdco Shares,
Warrants and Deducted Warrants, as applicable, attributable to such Person
(which such amounts will be calculated in accordance with the provisions of
the Valor Charter in effect immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time (with
respect to the Participating Rights Holders), applicable Law and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and shall not include any fractional shares)
before any Tax withholdings, and before deduction of the Escrowed Shares and
the portion of the Representative Reimbursement Amount attributable to such
Person, in respect of all of such Persons (A) Valor Ordinary Shares, (B)
shares of each series of Valor Preferred Shares, (C) Valor Warrants, (D)
Valor Options, and (E) Interests in Mitral, as applicable; _provided_ that
with respect to such amounts, HW, Valor, Holdco and its Affiliates or the
Exchange Agent will be entitled to withhold Taxes in accordance with 
_Section 3.2(e)_;

(viii) such Persons Pro Rata Share;

 

(ix) the number of Holdco Common Shares comprising the Initial Representative
Reimbursement Amount to be issued to the Shareholder Representative or its
designee pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_ on behalf of such Person (which shall
not include any fractional shares); and

 

(x) the number of Holdco Common Shares comprising the Escrowed Shares to be
issued to the Escrow Agent on behalf of such Person (which shall not include
any fractional shares).

 



6 The Closing Payment Allocation Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation
and warranty of Valor hereunder made as of the time of delivery. In no event
shall Holdco be required to make all or any portion of any payment to any
Person hereunder unless and until the Closing Payment Allocation Schedule has
been delivered by Valor. Holdco and HW shall be entitled to rely upon the
Closing Payment Allocation Schedule for all purposes in connection with making
the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1_ to be made on the Closing Date and
neither the Shareholder Representative nor any Participating Rights Holder or
the Founders shall be entitled to make any claim in respect of the allocation
of the Closing Holdco Shares to be paid by Holdco to or for the benefit of any
Person to the extent that such payment is made in a manner consistent with
the Closing Payment Allocation Schedule.

(e) _Post-Closing Adjustment to Closing Adjustment Amount_.

 

(i) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Holdco and HW shall
prepare and deliver to the Shareholder Representative its calculation of the
Closing Adjustment Amount (the " _Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation_ ").

 

(ii) The Shareholder Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days
(the " _Objection Period_ ") after delivery of the Holdco Closing Adjustment
Calculation in which to provide written notice to Holdco of any objections
thereto (the " _Objection Notice_ "). During such thirty (30) day period,
Holdco shall provide the Shareholder Representative and its Representatives
with reasonable access, during normal business hours and in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of Holdco, to the books of
account and records used by any member of the Holdco Group to prepare the
Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation and the Holdco Groups Representatives
who were involved in the preparation of such Holdco Closing Adjustment
Calculation for the purpose of assisting the Shareholder Representative and
its Representatives in their review of the amounts set forth therein. The
Objection Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail all disputed items in
the Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation. The Holdco Closing
Adjustment Calculation and the resulting Closing Adjustment Amount, as
adjusted, shall be deemed to be accepted by the Shareholder Representative on
behalf of the Participating Rights Holders, and shall become final and binding
on the parties on the latest of the expiration of the Objection Period or the
date on which all objections have been resolved by the parties or the
Independent Accounting Firm. If the Shareholder Representative gives any such
Objection Notice within the Objection Period, then the Shareholder
Representative and Holdco shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute
concerning the item(s) subject to such Objection Notice. If the Shareholder
Representative and Holdco do not resolve any dispute arising in connection
with the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount or relating to the
Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation within thirty (30) days after the date
of delivery of the Objection Notice, which 30-day period may be extended by
written agreement of Holdco and the Shareholder Representative (such period,
as it may be extended, the " _Initial Resolution Period_ "), such dispute
shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
1.5(e)(iii)_ below.

 



7 (iii) If Holdco and the Shareholder Representative have not been able to
resolve a dispute arising in connection with the calculation of the Closing
Adjustment Amount or relating to the Holdco Closing Adjustment Calculation
within the Initial Resolution Period, either party may submit such dispute to,
and such dispute shall be resolved fully, finally and exclusively through the
use of PricewaterhouseCoopers, or a firm of nationally recognized independent
public accountants in the United States reasonably acceptable to each of
Holdco and the Shareholder Representative if PricewaterhouseCoopers shall
have a material conflict of interest at the time (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
incurred in the resolution of such dispute shall be borne by the parties in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by
the Participating Rights Holders and Holdco from the resolution of the
dispute. For example, if the Shareholder Representative challenges the
calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount in the Holdco Closing Adjustment
Calculation by an amount of $100,000, but the Independent Accounting Firm
determines that the Participating Rights Holders have a valid claim for only
$40,000, Holdco shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm and the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the
Participating Rights Holders) shall bear the other 60% of such fees and
expenses. All other fees and expenses incurred by a party in connection with
the Closing Adjustment Amount shall be borne by the party incurring such cost.
Any dispute resolution proceeding shall be commenced within thirty (30) days
after the expiration of the Initial Resolution Period. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall determine (and written notice thereof shall
be given to the Shareholder Representative and Holdco) as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days following its
appointment, based solely on written submissions detailing the disputed items
submitted to it by both parties, only (x) whether the Holdco Closing
Adjustment Calculation, and Holdcos calculation of the adjusted Closing
Adjustment Amount were prepared in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and (y) with respect to the disputed items submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm, whether and to what extent (if any) the
Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement, the Holdco Closing
Adjustment Calculation or the Closing Adjustment Amount require adjustment
together with a written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required
adjustment, including the basis therefor, and the Independent Accounting Firm
shall make no other determinations or calculations. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not be entitled to impose
penalties or interest on any party. All negotiations pursuant to this _Section
1.5(e)(iii)_ shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for
purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable other
Laws, including state rules of evidence, and all negotiations, submissions to
the Independent Accounting Firm, and dispute resolution proceedings under
this _Section 1.5(e)(iii)_, shall be treated as confidential information. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be bound by a mutually agreeable
confidentiality agreement. The procedures of this  _Section 1.5(e)(iii)_ are
exclusive and, except as set forth below, the determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The decision
rendered pursuant to this _Section 1.5(e)(iii)_ may be filed as a judgment
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may seek specific
enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any decision under
this _Section 1.5(e)(iii)_. The other partys only defense to such a request
for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be limited to fraud and
manifest error.

 



8 (iv) Promptly after the Closing Adjustment Amount becomes final and binding
on the parties in accordance with either of subsections (ii) or (iii) of this
_Section 1.5(e)_ (the " _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ "), the parties
shall proceed as set forth in the remainder of this  _Section 1.5(e)(iv)_.
In the event that the Final Closing Adjustment Amount as recalculated is
greater than the Closing Adjustment Amount set forth in the Capitalization and
Closing Adjustment Amount Statement, Holdco shall recover, at Holdcos
option, either from the Escrowed Shares (valued at the Signing Date Price) or
by set-off against the next Contingent Payment to be made hereunder, an amount
equal to such excess valued at the Signing Date Price. In the event that
the Closing Adjustment Amount set forth on the Capitalization and Closing
Adjustment Amount Statement is greater than the Final Closing Adjustment
Amount, Holdco shall, within five (5) business days after the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount as recalculated becomes final and binding, make an
additional Contingent Payment to the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders by the issuance of Holdco Common Shares (valued at the Signing Date
Price) in an amount equal to such difference.

 

1.6 _Additional Payments_.

 

(a) _Contingent Payments_. As additional consideration for the ISR Merger, but
subject to the set-off rights of Holdco pursuant to  _Section 11.4_ and the
other terms of _Article 11_ , after the ISR Effective Time, Holdco shall, upon
satisfaction of the contingencies thereto, be required to make certain

pursuant to _Section 11.4_ and the other terms of _Article 11_ , and subject

") following the achievement, if any, during the Earnout Period of the CE
Mark Milestone; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the CE Mark Milestone is
achieved prior to the Closing Date, the CE Mark Contingent Payment shall be
made at the Closing and a portion of the CE Mark Contingent Payment shall be
deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 1.5(b)_. In no event
shall Holdco be required to make more than one (1) CE Mark Contingent Payment.

required to make more than one (1) First-in-Man Contingent Payment.

pursuant to  _Section 11.4_ and the other terms of _Article 11_ , and
subject to _Section 1.6(e)_, Holdco shall make a Contingent Payment in the
amount of the Net Sales Milestone Consideration Amount (the " _Net Sales
Contingent Payment_ ") following the achievement, if any, during the Earnout
Period of the Net Sales Milestone. Other than as contemplated by _Section
1.6(e)_, in no event shall Holdco be required to make more than one (1) Net
Sales Contingent Payment.

(e) _Acceleration_. Upon the consummation of a Change in Control of HW at any
time during the period between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time, or
upon the consummation of a Change in Control of Holdco or the ISR Surviving
Company at any time from and after the Effective Time, (i) any remaining
unpaid CE Mark Contingent Payment and First-in-Man Contingent Payment shall
immediately be due and payable by Holdco to the Participating Rights Holders
and the Founders upon the consummation of such Change in Control,
notwithstanding any failure to achieve the CE Mark Milestone and/or
the First-in-Man Milestone, (ii) each Warrant and Deducted Warrant shall
immediately vest and become exercisable for the full number of Warrant Shares

such Change in Control, notwithstanding any failure to achieve any amount of
Net Sales in any period, and (iii) any remaining unpaid Net Sales Contingent
Payment shall be due and payable by Holdco to the Participating Rights

notwithstanding any failure to achieve the Net Sales Milestone;

 

(B) an additional $75,000,000 of the Net Sales Milestone Consideration Amount

the event that the aggregate Net Sales during any period of twelve (12)
consecutive calendar months during the Accelerated Earnout Period equals
$150,000,000; and

 



10 (E) in the event that no payments are made pursuant to  _Section 1.6(e)(D)_,

In the event of a Change in Control of Holdco or the ISR Surviving Company,
proper provision shall be made by Holdco or the ISR Surviving Company, as
applicable, such that the transferees, purchasers, surviving entity,
successors, assigns or other beneficiaries of, or parties to, such
transaction shall assume each of the obligations of any member of the Holdco
Group set forth in _Sections 1.6_ , _1.7_ , _3.1_ , _8.11_ , _8.12_ and
_8.18_. In the event of each subsequent transaction having similar effect
with respect to any transferees, purchasers, surviving entity, successors,
assigns, other beneficiaries or parties in respect of a Change in Control of
Holdco or the ISR Surviving Company or any such subsequent transaction,
proper provision shall be made by the applicable transferees, purchasers,
surviving entity, successors, assigns, other beneficiaries or parties such
that such person or persons shall assume each of the obligations of set forth
in _Sections 1.6_ , _1.7_ , _3.1_ , _8.11_ , _8.12_ and _8.18_ that are
obligations of any member of the Holdco Group as written herein. In the event
of a Change in Control of Holdco or the ISR Surviving Company or a subsequent
transaction described in this paragraph, all references in _Sections 1.6_ ,
_1.7_ , and the related definitions in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto shall be
deemed to be references of the applicable transferees, purchasers, surviving
entity, successors, assigns, other beneficiaries or parties described in this
paragraph and each of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, successors
and assigns. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no payment
shall be required under this _Section 1.6(e)_ prior to the Closing or if the
Closing does not occur.

(f) _Holdco s Obligations_. During the Earnout Period:

(i) _Efforts Obligation_. Holdco and its Subsidiaries (the " _Holdco Group_
") shall use commercially reasonable efforts, including such efforts that are
consistent with Holdco and its Subsidiaries (individually or in the
aggregate) ordinary course of conduct with respect to other products of
similar materiality to the Holdco Group to (A) seek and obtain any regulatory
approval or Permit required for the manufacture, sale, use and
Commercialization of the Cardioband Product and the Cardioband TR Product in
the United States and (B) satisfy the conditions of, and achieve, the CE Mark
Milestone and the First-in-Man Milestone with respect to the Cardioband TR
Product (such efforts under _Sections 1.6(f)(i)(A)_ and _(B)_ , the "
_Efforts Obligation_ "); _provided_ , that in the event that the Holdco Group
finally determines at any time, in compliance with the Efforts Obligations, to
discontinue efforts to achieve the First-in-Man Milestone with respect to the
Cardioband TR Product, the reference to "First-in-Man with respect to the
Cardioband TR Product" in the preceding clause (B) shall be deemed to be a
reference to "First-in-Man with respect to the Cardiovalve Product" from and
after such time; _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties acknowledge and
agree that, as of the Agreement Date, it is the parties current expectation
that the First-in-Man Milestone with respect to the 

 



11  Cardioband TR Product will more likely be achieved prior to the First-in-Man
Milestone, if any, with respect to the Cardiovalve Product. Without limiting
the consideration of other factors that may be relevant from time to time,
some of the factors that may be taken into account in determining whether
certain efforts by the Holdco Group are deemed to be "commercially reasonable"
at any time with respect to any Valor Products shall include the stage of
development of such Valor Product, the market potential of such Valor Product
(including anticipated and actual profit margins), the level of regulatory
approval that may be available for such Valor Product (including but not
limited to the extent of the indications for which the Valor Products may be
approved), the level of reimbursement that may be available for such Valor
Product, the cost and outcome of any clinical trials, the safety and efficacy
of such Valor Product, the level of Intellectual Property protection of such
Valor Product, the presence of third-party Intellectual Property that may
impact the marketability of such Valor Product, the presence or absence of
particularly difficult manufacturing issues, and the expected competitive
position of such Valor Product vis-a-vis other therapies that may have been or
may be developed, marketed and sold for the same or similar indications,
including with respect to the expected or actual efficacy and cost of such
Valor Product when compared to such other products. For purposes of
determining whether or not the Holdco Group is complying with the Efforts
Obligation, the efforts of the Holdco Group with respect to each of the
Valor Products shall be considered separately. Furthermore, any
determinations on whether or not the Holdco Group shall have acted in
compliance with the Efforts Obligation at any time shall be measured based on
the information then available to the Holdco Group.

(ii) _Certain Obligations_. Holdco shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to, (A) take any actions in bad faith with respect to the
Valor Products during the Earnout Period, or (B) knowingly and intentionally
take any actions, or knowingly and intentionally omit to take any actions,
with respect to the Valor Products during the Earnout Period which (x) are
not commercially reasonable (with respect to actions undertaken) or are
commercially reasonable (with respect to actions not undertaken), and (y) are
undertaken, or not undertaken, in each case with respect to this clause (B),
with the primary intent or purpose of avoiding, materially delaying or
preventing the achievement of any of the Milestones during the Earnout Period
or payment of any of the Contingent Payments, including the Net Sales
Milestone and the Net Sales Contingent Payment.

(iii) _Restriction on Certain Asset Transfers_. Other than in connection with
a Change in Control of the Holdco Group or the ISR Surviving Company, the
Holdco Group shall not sell, assign, transfer or license (outbound), in each
case to any Person other than a member of the Holdco Group, any material
Valor Owned Intellectual Property or Valor Licensed Intellectual Property or
any material Intellectual Property derived therefrom, or any material
Intellectual Property conceived or reduced to practice by the Israeli
Technology Center including, without limitation, any Intellectual Property
conceived of, developed by, or otherwise participated in the development of,
in each case whether in whole or in part, by the Israeli Technology Center,
during the Earnout Period (for the avoidance of doubt, any Valor Owned
Intellectual Property, Valor Licensed Intellectual Property or such other
Intellectual Property shall be deemed to be "material" for the

 



12  purposes of this _Section 1.6(f)(ii)_ if the sale, assignment, transfer, or
license (outbound) of such Valor Owned Intellectual Property, such Valor
Licensed Intellectual Property or such other Intellectual Property in each
case would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (x) the
ability of the Cardioband Product or the Cardioband TR Product to obtain
regulatory approval in the United States or (y) the achievement during the
Earnout Period of any of the Milestones); _provided_ that (i) the Holdco Group
shall have the right to cross-license any Valor Owned Intellectual Property,
Valor Licensed Intellectual Property or such other Intellectual Property on a
non-exclusive basis to the extent that the Holdco Group reasonably determines
such license is necessary or useful to reduce the risk of infringement or to
reduce exposure to third party Intellectual Property, (ii) the Holdco Group
shall have the right to license any Valor Owned Intellectual Property, Valor
Licensed Intellectual Property or such other Intellectual Property on a non-
exclusive basis for use in ventricular assist devices, and (iii) the Holdco
Group shall have the right to transfer, assign or license any such material
Valor Owned Intellectual Property, Valor Licensed Intellectual Property or
such other Intellectual Property with the prior written consent of
the Shareholder Representative.

(g) _Holdco Discretion_. Subject to the obligations of the Holdco Group under
the other provisions of this _Sections 1.6_ and _8.12_ , and without limiting
those obligations, the Holdco Group shall have sole discretion over all
matters relating to the Valor Products and the Valor Business after the ISR
Effective Time, including, but not limited to, any research, Development,
Commercialization, engineering, clinical trial design, site selection,
regulatory, quality standards, legal, Intellectual Property, manufacturing,
licensing and sales decisions, regulatory approvals and reimbursement
approvals relating to the Valor Products and the Valor Business. The parties
hereby acknowledge that the achievement of the Milestones are subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions which may not occur.

 

(h) _Safe Harbor_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in the event that Holdco and its Affiliates comply with the expenditure
requirements of _Section 8.12_, the Shareholder Representative (on behalf of
the Participating Rights Holders and Founders) shall not be permitted to
allege (i) that the Efforts Obligations have not been satisfied with respect
to the Cardioband Product during the periods described in _Section 8.12(a)_
due to any failure of the Holdco Group to expend funds for the purposes
described in _Section 8.12(a)_ and (ii) that the Efforts Obligations have
not been satisfied with respect to the First-in-Man Milestone with respect to
the Cardioband TR Product during the periods described in _Section 8.12(b)_
due to any failure of the Holdco Group to expend funds for the
purposes described in _Section 8.12(b)_.

(i) _Assignability_. The right of any Participating Rights Holder to receive
any portion of a Contingent Payment will not be assignable or transferable
except, subject to compliance with applicable securities Laws, (i) by
operation of Law or the Laws of descent and distribution, divorce or community
property, will or intestate succession, (ii) if such Participating Rights
Holder is an entity, to any of its partners, members or other equity owners,
or retired partners, retired members or other equity owners, or to the estate
of any of its partners, members or other equity owners or retired partners,
retired members or other equity owners and (iii) if such Participating Rights
Holder is an individual, to (A) trusts, so long as all beneficiaries of such
trusts are such Participating Rights Holder and/or such Participating Rights
Holders parents, spouse, descendants or siblings or descendants of such
individuals siblings, or (B) family

 



13  limited partnerships or family limited liability companies, so long as all
of the equity interests of such family limited partnerships or family limited
liability companies are and in the future will be owned by such Participating
Rights Holder and/or such Participating Rights Holders parents, spouse,
descendants or siblings or descendants of such individuals siblings, and any
attempted or purported transfer in violation of this sentence will be null
and void.

(j) _Contingent Payments Not Securities_. Valor hereby acknowledges and
agrees, and by their adoption of this Agreement, acceptance of consideration
under this Agreement or, if applicable, delivery of a Letter of Transmittal
contemplated by _Section 3.2(a)(i)_, the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders acknowledge and agree that: (i) except as provided in this
Agreement, a Contingent Payment does not represent any ownership or Security
in Valor, ISR Merger Sub, the ISR Surviving Company or Holdco and does not
entitle any Participating Rights Holder or any Founder to voting rights or
rights to dividend payments, (ii) a Contingent Payment is solely represented
by this Agreement and is not represented by any certificate, instrument or
other delivery, (iii) a Contingent Payment is solely a contractual right and
is not a security for purposes of any securities Laws, and confers upon the
Participating Rights Holders and the Founders only the rights of a general
unsecured creditor under applicable Law, (iv) the Contingent Payments do not
bear interest, and (v) the Contingent Payments are not redeemable. In the
event any Contingent Payment is required to be paid to the Participating
Rights Holders and the Founders pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof, a
portion of such payment may be treated as interest for U.S. income Tax
purposes. Each of the Participating Rights Holders, the Founders, Valor and
the Shareholder Representative acknowledge and agree that no separate payment
of interest will be made by Holdco with respect to any such Contingent
Payment.

(k) _Termination_. The Holdco Groups obligations under this  _Section 1.6_

earlier time is expressly provided herein with respect to such Contingent
Payment); _provided_ , _however_ , that any such termination shall not relieve
Holdco of its obligations to make any Contingent Payment to the extent
the applicable Milestone has been achieved at or prior to the end of the
Earnout Period.

1.7 _Payment of Contingent Payments_.

 

(a) _Net Sales Certificates; Information; Access; and Audit Rights_. On or

categories of expenditure thereof, which amounts described in this clause (ii)
shall be derived from the books and records of the Holdco Group maintained in
the ordinary course of business (and, with respect to each of the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), in the case of the first Net Sales Certificate delivered

Sales Certificate delivered for a calendar quarter during such periods shall
also include a calculation of the underlying Net Sales broken down on a
month-by-month basis (and a product-by-product basis during each month).
During the Earnout Period, the Shareholder Representative and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access, during regular business hours
and upon reasonable advance written notice, to (A) the books and records of
the Holdco Group and (B) the Holdco Groups personnel, in each case, solely to
the extent necessary to assist the Shareholder Representative and its
Representatives in connection with the Shareholder Representatives review of
any Net Sales Certificate; _provided_ , that the Shareholder Representative
shall only be permitted to exercise such information and access rights twice
per calendar year; _provided_ , that such access to books and records shall be
limited to such period as is reasonably required in order to complete such
review thereof; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, the Holdco Group shall not
be required to provide any access to any book, record, contract or document or
provide any information (x) that is subject to an attorney-client or other
legal privilege that might be impaired by such disclosure ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Holdco Group shall use its reasonable efforts to redact
or otherwise provide such book, record, contract, document or information in a
manner that does not jeopardize such attorney-client or other legal privilege)
or (y) if such access or provision is prohibited by applicable Law. In the
event that the Shareholder Representative exercises its rights hereunder with
respect to a period covered by a Net Sales Certificate, the Shareholder
Representative shall be precluded from such information and access rights in
a subsequent period with respect to such previously reviewed Net Sales
Certificate. The Shareholder Representatives shall, and shall and shall direct
any person who receives any information pursuant to this _Section 1.7(a)_ to

commercially reasonable efforts to provide Holdco with advance notice of such
requirement and a reasonable opportunity to seek confidential treatment with
respect to such information in advance of any disclosure of such information
by the Shareholder Representative, (B) that the Shareholder Representative may

relating to Net Sales and achievement of any of the Milestones consistent with
its then current ordinary course document retention policy for similar
information; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holdco Group shall be required

to this _Section 1.7(b)(iii)_, the " _Accountant_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that in the event that no such Person may be engaged pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 1.7(b)(iii)_, the "Accountant" shall be a firm of

reasonably acceptable to each of Holdco and the Shareholder Representative;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the engagement and charge of the Accountant
shall be limited to determining whether the Net Sales Milestone or the Net
Sales milestone set forth in the Warrants and the Deducted Warrants has been
achieved, and, without limiting the foregoing, the Accountant shall not be
entitled to determine any other matter. The Shareholder Representative and
Holdco shall jointly select which of the Accountants will perform the
calculation within thirty (30) days after the Shareholder Representative and
Holdco determine that they are unable to settle such dispute independently.
The Accountant selected in accordance with the foregoing sentence, who shall
be mutually agreeable to Holdco and the Shareholder Representative, shall be
referred to herein as the " _Appraiser_." The Appraiser shall determine
whether the Net Sales Milestone has been achieved within the limitations set
forth above within sixty (60) days after the date of such Appraisers
engagement. The reasonable fees and expenses of the Appraiser shall be paid by
the Shareholder Representative out of the Representative Reimbursement Amount;
_provided_ , that if the Appraiser determines that the Net Sales Milestone or
the Net Sales milestone set forth in the Warrants and the Deducted Warrants
has been achieved, Holdco shall pay the fees and expenses of the Appraiser.

the date of the achievement of any Milestone ( _provided_ , in the case of
the Net Sales Milestone, on or prior to the tenth (10th) business day
following the date on which the Net Sales Certificate is prepared for the

that if the CE Mark Milestone or the First-in-Man Milestone is reached prior
to the Closing Date, no such notice shall be required.

from Holdco of a Milestone Notice which indicates that a Contingent Payment is
due, the Shareholder Representative shall deliver to Holdco any updates that
the Shareholder Representative deems reasonably necessary to the Closing
Payment Allocation Schedule or notify Holdco that no such updates are

17   _Schedule Update_ "). Holdco and the ISR Surviving Company shall be
entitled to rely upon the Closing Payment Allocation Schedule Update in
connection with a Contingent Payment, and, in the event that no Closing
Payment Allocation Schedule Update has been so delivered within such twenty
(20) day period, Holdco and the ISR Surviving Company shall be entitled to
rely upon the Closing Payment Allocation Schedule, in connection with a
Contingent Payment and neither the Shareholder Representative nor any
Participating Rights Holder or Founder shall be entitled to make any claim in
respect of the allocation of such Contingent Payment made by Holdco to or for
the benefit of any Participating Rights Holder or Founder to the extent that
such Contingent Payment is made in a manner consistent with the applicable
Closing Payment Allocation Schedule Update (or, if no Closing Payment

Pro Rata Share of such Contingent Payment Amount; _provided_ that the CE Mark

Common Shares contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.3_ out of the
US Exchange Fund.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than five days after the Effective Time), Holdco shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of HW Common Stock (other than the Excluded
HW Shares) represented by HW Certificates: (A) an appropriate and customary
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the HW Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the HW Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be
in such form as Holdco, HW and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably agree; and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the HW Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the HW Certificates as provided in  _Section
2.6(e)_) in exchange for the US Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a HW
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the HW Certificate as provided in
_Section 2.6(e)_) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such HW Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the US Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in  _Section
3.2(e)_), and the HW Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the HW Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of HW Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of HW, the US Merger
Consideration upon due surrender of the HW Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the HW Certificate formerly representing such HW Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required by Holdco to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each HW Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the US Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of HW Book-Entry Shares shall be required to
deliver a HW Certificate or, in the case of holders of HW Book-Entry Shares
held through The Depositary Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal
to the Exchange Agent to receive the US Merger Consideration that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article 2_. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more HW Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depositary Trust Company whose HW Common Stock were converted into the right
to receive the US Merger Consideration shall automatically upon

 



21  the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Holdco shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, in respect of each such HW Book-Entry Share the US Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(e)_), and such HW Book-Entry Shares of such holder
shall forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(and in no event later than five days after the Effective Time), Holdco shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, a holder of record of HW Book-Entry Shares not held
through The Depositary Trust Company: (A) an appropriate and customary letter
of transmittal, which shall be in such form as Holdco and the Exchange Agent
shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such letter of
transmittal in exchange for the US Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of
such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such HW Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the US Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
3.2(e)_), and such HW Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. The US Merger Consideration with respect to HW Book-Entry Shares
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such HW Book-Entry Shares are
registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of HW Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each HW Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the US Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) _Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of HW
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of HW Common Stock on the records of HW. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of HW Certificates and HW Book-Entry Shares
representing shares of HW Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law, subject,
however, to the US Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by HW on such shares of HW Common Stock
not in violation of the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, HW Certificates representing shares of HW Common Stock are
presented to Holdco for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the US Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property_. At any time following one year
after the Closing Date, Holdco shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to it, or its nominee, any Holdco Common Shares or cash
remaining in the US Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent and not
delivered to holders of HW Certificates or HW Book-Entry Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Holdco (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the US Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender
of their HW Certificates or HW Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
procedures in _Section 3.2(e)_. If, prior to six years after the Closing Date
(or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect
hereof would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority
pursuant to any

 



22  applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of HW
Certificates or HW Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in
_Section 3.2(e)_ to receive the US Merger Consideration to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled, the US Merger Consideration to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled in respect of such HW Certificates or HW Book-
Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Holdco, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Holdco nor
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a HW Certificate or HW
Book-Entry Shares for US Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any HW
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed HW Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the US
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to  _Section
2.3(b)_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco or the Exchange Agent
may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of the US Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed HW Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Holdco or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the HW Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Holdco Common Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to the Holdco Common Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered HW Certificate
or HW Book-Entry Share with respect to the Holdco Common Shares represented
thereby, unless and until the holder of such HW Certificate or HW Book-Entry
Share shall surrender such HW Certificate or HW Book-Entry Share. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such HW Certificate, there shall be paid by Holdco to the holder of the
certificates representing Holdco Common Shares issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such Holdco Common Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender,
payable with respect to such Holdco Common Shares.

2.7 _HW Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) _Treatment of HW Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each option to
acquire shares of HW Common Stock (a " _HW Stock Option_ ") granted under (i)
the HW Employee Stock Option Plan, (ii) the HW 2008 Stock Incentive Plan,
(iii) the HW 2012 Incentive Award Plan, or (iv) the non-plan stock options
granted in 2007 (collectively, the " _HW Equity Plans_ ") that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Holdco and shall be converted into
an option (a " _Holdco Stock Option_ ") to acquire Holdco Common Shares in
accordance with this _Section 2.7(a)_. Each such Holdco Stock Option as so
assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the HW Stock

 



23  Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any
changes thereto provided for in the applicable HW Equity Plan, in any award
agreement or in such HW Stock Option by reason of this Agreement or the
Transactions). As of the Effective Time, each such Holdco Stock Option as so
assumed and converted shall be an option to acquire that number of Holdco
Common Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of HW Common Stock subject to such HW Stock Option
and (ii) the HW Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per Holdco Common Share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the exercise price per share of HW Common Stock of such HW Stock
Option by (y) the HW Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and
the number of Holdco Common Shares subject to the Holdco Stock Option
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code, and, in the case of HW Stock Options that are intended to
qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

(b) _Treatment of HW Restricted Stock Units_. As of the Effective Time,
each restricted stock unit award granted under the applicable HW Equity Plan
(a " _HW RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not it is vested, shall be assumed by Holdco and shall be converted
into a restricted stock unit award (a " _Holdco RSU_ ") with respect to
Holdco Common Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.7(b)_. Each such
Holdco RSU as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the HW RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes
thereto provided for in the applicable HW Equity Plan, in any award agreement
or in such HW RSU by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the
Effective Time, each such Holdco RSU as so assumed and converted shall be a
restricted stock unit award for that number of Holdco Common Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of HW Common Stock underlying such HW RSU, _multiplied_ by (ii) the HW
Exchange Ratio.

(c) Not later than the Closing Date, Holdco shall deliver to the holders of
HW Stock Options and HW RSUs any required notices setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the relevant HW Equity Plan and award documents and stating
that such HW Stock Options and HW RSUs have been assumed by Holdco and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions subject, in each case, to
the adjustments required by this _Section 2.7_ after giving effect to the US
Merger and the terms of the relevant HW Equity Plan.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, HW shall take all necessary action for the
adjustment of HW Stock Options and HW RSUs under this _Section 2.7_. Holdco
shall reserve for future issuance a number of Holdco Common Shares at least
equal to the number of Holdco Common Shares that will be subject to Holdco
Stock Options and Holdco RSUs as a result of the actions contemplated by this
_Section 2.7_. Not later than the Closing Date, Holdco shall file an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with
respect to the Holdco Common Shares subject to such Holdco Stock Options and
Holdco RSUs and shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, and
Holdco shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Holdco Stock Options and Holdco RSUs remain outstanding.

 



24 (e) As of the Effective Time, Holdco shall assume all HW Equity Plans and the
awards granted thereunder in accordance with this _Section 2.7_ and will be
able to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible by applicable Laws and
NASDAQ regulations, under the terms of the HW Equity Plans covering the
reserved but unissued HW Shares, except that (i) HW Common Stock covered by
such awards will be Holdco Common Shares and (ii) all references to a number
of HW Common Stock will be changed to references to Holdco Common Shares. As
soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in
any event prior to the Effective Time, the HW Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering HWs stock-based incentive plans) and Holdco shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be reasonably
required to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.7_.

shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Valor Capital

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contingent Payments (or portions thereof)
otherwise attributable to such Valor Capital Stock may be reduced pursuant to
the rights of Holdco under _Section 11.4_.

(b) _Valor Warrants_. By virtue of the ISR Merger and without any action on
the part of Valor or the Participating Rights Holders, each unexercised Valor
Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time and held by
Participating Rights Holders shall be canceled and converted at the ISR
Effective Time into the right to receive from Holdco, for each share subject
to such Valor Warrant, (i) the Per Share Closing Consideration _minus_ a
number of Holdco Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_
(A) the exercise price per share for the Valor Capital Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Valor Warrant by (B) the Signing Date Price, (ii) the Per
Share Warrant Consideration, (iii) the Per Share Contingent Payment

Warrant shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the consideration set forth in this _Section

thereof) otherwise attributable to Valor Warrants may be reduced pursuant to
the rights of Holdco under _Section 11.4_.

 

(c) _Valor Options_. By virtue of the ISR Merger and without any action on the
part of Valor or the holders thereof, each option granted pursuant to the
Valor Option Plan (each a " _Valor Option_ ") that is outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time, whether or not
vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and terminated at the ISR Effective
Time in exchange for the right to receive from Holdco, for each share subject
to such Valor Option, (i) the Per Share Closing Consideration _minus_ a number
of Holdco Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by  _dividing_ (A) the
exercise price per share for the Valor Ordinary Shares purchasable pursuant to
the Valor Option by (B) the Signing Date Price, (ii) the Per Share Warrant
Consideration, (iii) the Per Share Contingent Payment Consideration
associated with any Contingent Payment required to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, (iv) the right to receive portions of the Escrowed Shares, if any,
distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, and
(v) the right to receive portions of the Representative Reimbursement Amount,
if any, distributed to the Participating Rights Holders in accordance with
_Section 3.7(e)_. All such Valor Options, when so terminated and exchanged,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Valor Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration set forth in this _Section 3.1(c)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Contingent Payments (or portions thereof) otherwise
attributable to Valor Options may be reduced pursuant to the rights of Holdco
under _Section 11.4_.

 



26 (d) _Contingent Equity Rights_. Except as set forth in _Sections 3.1(a)_ , 
_3.1(b)_ , _3.1(c)_ and _3.1(e)_ , any options, warrants or other contingent
rights (if any) to acquire capital stock of Valor as of the ISR Effective Time
shall be cancelled or terminated in connection with the ISR Merger
without payment of any consideration therefor.

(e) _HW Owned Equity and Dormant Shares_. At the ISR Effective Time, all Valor
Preferred Shares held by HW or any of its Affiliates shall be automatically
converted into an equal number of Valor Ordinary Shares. No HW Owned Equity
shall receive Merger Consideration and all HW Owned Equity shall remain
outstanding as equity interests of ISR Surviving Company following the ISR
Effective Time. HW shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, transfer
or assign any Securities of Valor to any Person other than HW or any of its
Affiliates prior to the ISR Effective Time. Each "dormant share" of Valor
Ordinary Shares or Valor Preferred Shares held by Valor immediately prior to
the ISR Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished at the ISR
Effective Time without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

(f) _Shares of ISR Merger Sub_. Each ordinary share of ISR Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) validly issued fully paid and nonassessable ordinary
share of the ISR Surviving Company.

 

(g) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no fractional Holdco Common Shares will be issued, and no
certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued
hereunder. In lieu thereof, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Signing
Date Price of all such fractional shares shall instead be deposited with the
Shareholder Representative by Holdco as additional Representative
Reimbursement Amount.

(h) _Equitable Adjustments_.

 

(i) If at any time between the Effective Time and the payment of the First-in-
Man Contingent Payment or the CE Mark Contingent Payment, any change in the
outstanding Holdco Common Shares shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a reverse share
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share
dividend or share distribution with a record date during such period (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not as a result of the exercise of any outstanding
Holdco or HW stock options, the issuance of securities in any capital-raising
transactions by Holdco and repurchases or redemptions from individual
stockholders), the number of shares issuable in respect of the First-in-Man
Contingent Payment or the CE Mark Contingent Payment, as applicable, shall be
proportionately adjusted to provide the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders the same proportional ownership as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

 

(ii) If at any time between the Effective Time and the payment of the First-
in-Man Contingent Payment or the CE Mark Contingent Payment, Holdco makes or
declares any dividends or distributions (other than share dividends and share
distributions covered by _Section 3.1(h)(i)_), Holdco shall deposit in a
segregated account the amount of such dividends and distributions that would
have been payable in respect of Holdco Common Shares to be issued in respect
of the First-in-Man Contingent Payment or the

 



27  CE Mark Contingent Payment, as applicable, until the First-in-Man Contingent
Payment or the CE Mark Contingent Payment, as applicable, is paid to the
Participating Rights Holders and the Founders. Concurrently with such payment
of the First-in-Man Contingent Payment or the CE Mark Contingent Payment, as
applicable, Holdco shall deliver the applicable segregated dividends and
distributions to the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders.

(iii) If at any time from and after the first trading day on which Reference
Market Value is measured until the issuance to the Participating Rights
Holders and the Founders of any Holdco Common Shares that comprise the Net
Sales Contingent Payment pursuant to _Sections 1.6_ , _1.7_ , _3.1_ and _8.11_
, any change in the outstanding Holdco Common Shares shall occur as a result
of any reclassification, recapitalization, share split (including a reverse
share split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share
dividend or share distribution with a record date during such period (but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not as a result of the exercise of any outstanding
Holdco or HW stock options, the issuance of securities in any capital-raising
transactions by Holdco and repurchases or redemptions from
individual stockholders), the Reference Market Value and the number of Holdco
Common Shares issuable in respect of the Net Sales Contingent Payment shall be
proportionately adjusted to provide the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders the same proportional ownership as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

(iv) If at any time from and after the first trading day on which Reference
Market Value is measured until the issuance to the Participating Rights
Holders and the Founders of any Holdco Common Shares that comprise the Net
Sales Contingent Payment pursuant to _Sections 1.6_ , _1.7_ ,  _3.1_ and
_8.11_ , Holdco makes or declares any dividends or distributions (other than
share dividends and share distributions covered by _Section 3.1(h)(iii)_),
Holdco shall deposit in a segregated account the amount of such dividends and
distributions that would have been payable in respect of Holdco Common Shares
to be issued pursuant to such provisions as if such shares were outstanding at
such time until such shares are issued. Concurrently with the issuance of
such shares, Holdco shall deliver the applicable segregated dividends and
distributions to the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders.

 

3.2 _Exchange of Valor Certificates and Transmittal Materials for Closing
Payment_.

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Holdco shall engage U.S. Bank, N.A. or such other Person as shall mutually
be agreed in writing by HW and Valor (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to, among
other things, assist in the distribution of Holdco Common Shares and to effect
the distribution any cash payments required to be made by Holdco hereunder to
the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders. All fees and expenses of
the Exchange Agent under the Exchange Agreement shall be borne by Holdco.
Within a reasonable period of time prior to the Closing, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to each Participating Rights Holder and each Founder (A) a
Letter of Transmittal, Release and Joinder substantially in the form of
_Exhibit C_ attached hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B)
instructions for use in 

 



28  completing and submitting the Letter of Transmittal (and, in the case of
Participating Rights Holders, effecting the surrender of certificate or
certificates representing outstanding Valor Ordinary Shares or Valor
Preferred Shares and in the case of Founders, effecting the surrender of
certificate or certificates representing outstanding shares of Mitral
(collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section 3.2(e))_) in exchange for the Holdco
Common Shares representing that portion of the Merger Consideration or the
Founders Portion to which such Participating Rights Holder or such Founder,
as applicable, is entitled pursuant to the Closing Payment Allocation
Schedule.

(ii) The Letter of Transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section
3.2(d)_) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of the Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed, the applicable Participating Rights Holder or
Founder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration payable to such Participating Rights Holder, or, subject to
_Section 8.11_, Founders Portion payable to such Founder, pursuant to the
terms hereof (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(e)_), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or the Letter of Transmittal by
any Participating Rights Holder or Founder. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Valor Ordinary Shares or Valor Preferred Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of Valor, the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Valor Ordinary Shares or Valor
Preferred Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by Holdco to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. Holdco shall not be required to pay any amount of the Closing
Holdco Shares or any Contingent Payment to a Participating Rights Holder or
a Founder until receipt by the Exchange Agent from such Participating Rights
Holder or such Founder of properly completed and executed Letters of
Transmittal in the form attached hereto and the applicable Certificate.

 

(iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the ISR Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable amounts
of Merger Consideration or Founders Portion payable pursuant to _Section
3.1_.

 

(b) _No Further Rights in Certificates or Derivative Instruments_. From and
after the ISR Effective Time, holders of Valor Ordinary Shares, Valor
Preferred Shares and Valor Options outstanding immediately prior to the ISR
Effective Time will cease to be, and will have no rights as, shareholders or
rightsholders of Valor or the ISR Surviving Company, other than the right
to receive the portions of the Merger Consideration and rights under this
Agreement.

 



29 (c) _Termination of Exchange; No Liability_. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the ISR Effective Time, Holdco or the ISR
Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver
to it any Holdco Common Shares that had been made available to the Exchange
Agent and that have not been disbursed to the Participating Rights Holders or
the Founders and thereafter such Participating Rights Holders and the Founders
shall be entitled to look only to Holdco or the ISR Surviving Company (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable
to them, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Holdco, the ISR Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any holder of a Certificate for any portion of the Closing Holdco Shares (or
the value thereof) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the
Merger Consideration or the Founders Portion remaining unclaimed by the
Participating Rights Holders or the Founders three (3) years after the date on
which the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders are eligible to
receive payment thereof hereunder (or such earlier date, immediately prior to
such time when the Merger Consideration or the Founders Portion payable to
them would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
property of Holdco or the ISR Surviving Company, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate(s)
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by a Valor Shareholder or Founder thereof in form
reasonably satisfactory to Holdco, Holdco shall cause the Exchange Agent to
issue to such Valor Shareholder or Founder such Valor Shareholders
or Founders portion of the Closing Holdco Shares as provided in _Section
3.1_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition precedent to causing such issuance by the Exchange Agent,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s) to deliver
a customary agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to
Holdco and, to the extent required by the Exchange Agent despite reasonable
efforts to resist such requirement by Holdco, a bond in such sum as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Holdco, the ISR Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Holdco be required to issue a
bond or otherwise provide any indemnity or assurance to the Exchange Agent
with respect to any such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s).

(e) _Withholding Rights With Respect to Payments Made Under the Agreement_.

 

(i) Each of HW, Valor, the ISR Surviving Company, the US Surviving
Corporation, Holdco or any of their Affiliates and the Exchange Agent and the
Escrow Agent (each, a " _Payor_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement to any Participating Rights Holder or Founder (each, a "
_Payee_ "), and any other amount otherwise payable to any other person
pursuant to any provision or obligation under this Agreement, such amounts as
are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Each Payor shall pay the amount deducted
or withheld to the

 



30  proper Taxation Authority in accordance with applicable Law and shall
provide to the Payee with respect to whom such amounts were withheld or
deducted a written statement of the amount so withheld or deducted. Payor
shall be entitled to sell in the open market, but not to Holdco or any of its
Affiliates, all or a portion of the Holdco securities otherwise deliverable to
a Payee to the extent required to enable the relevant Payor to comply with
such deduction or withholding requirement. The Payor shall notify the relevant
Payee that such sale and withholding or deduction was made and remit to such
Payee any balance of the proceeds of such sale not applied to the payment
of Taxes less any costs or expenses incurred by the relevant Payor in
connection with such sale.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 3.2(e)(i)_, but subject to
_Section 3.2(e)(v)_, with respect to Israeli Tax, all amounts (cash or
securities) payable to a Payee shall be retained by the Exchange Agent (or its
designee) for a period of up to one hundred and eighty (180) days from the
Closing Date or an earlier date required in writing by a Payee in respect of
its applicable portion of its consideration or as otherwise required by the
ITA (the " _Withholding Drop Date_ ") (during which time neither the Payor
nor the Exchange Agent shall withhold any Israeli Tax on such consideration,
except as provided below), and during which time each such Payee (acting for
itself or through an agent) may obtain a certification or ruling (a "
_Withholding Certificate_ ") issued by the ITA, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Holdco and Payor (x) exempting Holdco from the duty
to withhold Israeli Taxes with respect to the applicable consideration of
such Payee, (y) determining the applicable rate of Israeli Tax to be imposed
on the applicable consideration of such Payee, or (z) providing any other
instructions regarding the payment or withholding with respect to the
applicable consideration of such Payee. In the event that prior to the
Withholding Drop Date, a Payee (or an agent acting on its behalf) submits to
Holdco and Exchange Agent a Withholding Certificate, in form and substance
acceptable to Holdco, the Exchange Agent shall act in accordance with the
provisions of such Withholding Certificate.

(iii) If any Payee entitled to payment hereunder (A) does not provide the
Holdco and Exchange Agent with a Withholding Certificate, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Holdco and Payor, prior to the Withholding
Drop Date, or (B) submits a written request to Holdco and the Exchange Agent
to release his, her or its portion of the applicable consideration prior to
the Withholding Drop Date and fails to submit a Withholding Certificate, in
form and substance acceptable to Holdco and Payor, at or prior to such time,
then the amount to be withheld from such Payees portion of the applicable
consideration shall be calculated according to the applicable withholding rate
as determined in good faith by Holdco in accordance with  _Section
3.2(e)(i)_.

(iv) Valor and any Participating Rights Holders may prepare and file with the
ITA an application for a ruling permitting any Participating Rights Holders
who elects to become a party to such a tax ruling (the " _Electing Holder_ "),
to defer any applicable Israeli Tax with respect to any consideration in
Holdco securities that such Electing Holder will receive pursuant to this
Agreement until the sale, transfer or other conveyance for cash of such Holdco
securities by such Electing Holder or such other date set forth in Section
104(h) of the Israeli Tax Code (the " _104(h) Tax Ruling_ "). Holdco and HW
shall reasonably cooperate with Valor and the applicable Participating Rights

 



31  Holders and their Israeli counsel with respect to the preparation and filing
of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions
that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the 104(h) Tax Ruling.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable law to obtain the 104(h) Tax Ruling, as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 3.2(e)(i)_, if the 104(h) Tax
Ruling shall be received and delivered to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Withholding Drop Date, then the provisions of the 104(h) Tax Ruling shall
apply and all applicable withholding and reporting procedures shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of the 104(h) Tax Ruling and Section 104(h)
of the Israeli Tax Code. The final text of the 104(h) Tax Ruling shall in all
circumstances be subject to the prior written confirmation of HW or its
counsel (such confirmation not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.2_, any
consideration which a holder of Valor 102 Shares, Valor 102 Options or Valor
3(i) Options has the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement in respect of
such Valor 102 Shares, Valor 102 Options or Valor 3(i) Options shall be
transferred (or caused to be transferred) directly to the Section 102
Trustee, in accordance with the Israeli Options Tax Ruling (or the Israeli
Options Interim Tax Ruling, as applicable), if obtained, and shall be held in
trust by the Section 102 Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the Israeli Tax Code (including Section 102) and the Israeli
Options Tax Ruling (or the Israeli Options Interim Tax Ruling, as applicable),
if obtained. The Section 102 Trustee shall be responsible for holding
such consideration, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section
102 of the Israeli Tax Code (as applicable), the Israeli Options Tax Ruling
(or the Israeli Options Interim Tax Ruling, as applicable) and the trust
documents governing the trust held by the Section 102 Trustee. If the Israeli
Options Tax Ruling (or the Israeli Options Interim Tax Ruling, as applicable),
is not obtained by the Withholding Drop Date then the Exchange Agent shall
transfer the consideration which a holder of Valor 102 Shares, Valor 102
Options or Valor 3(i) Options has the right to receive pursuant to this
Agreement to such holder of Valor 102 Shares, Valor 102 Options or Valor 3(i)
Options and the amount to be withheld from such Payees portion of the
applicable consideration shall be calculated according to the applicable
withholding rate as determined in good faith by Holdco in accordance with
_Section 3.2(e)(ii)_ or _Section 3.2(e)(iii)_, as applicable.

 

(vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.2_, with
respect to any non-Israeli resident holders of Valor Options or Valor
Ordinary Shares that were granted such securities in consideration for work or
services performed outside of Israel for a non-Israeli resident Subsidiary of
Valor (provided that any such holder provides Holdco and Exchange Agent with
a validly executed declaration, in the form attached as _Exhibit E_ , which
includes, _inter alia_ , a declaration regarding such holders non-Israeli
residence and confirmation such holder was granted such securities
in consideration for work or services performed outside of Israel for a non-
Israeli resident subsidiary of Valor and performed all work and services
outside of Israel), the payment of any consideration which such holders have
the right to receive shall not be subject to any withholding or deduction of
Israeli Tax unless the ITA determines otherwise.

herein), Valor shall deliver or cause to be delivered to HW or Holdco, as

liabilities, including attorneys fees, fees of other skilled professionals

be deducted from such payments to the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders in accordance with each Participating Rights Holders and each
Founders Pro Rata Share of such payments). The Shareholder Representative
will hold the Representative Reimbursement Amount, at the
Shareholder Representatives option and in its sole discretion, (i) with the
Escrow Agent or (ii) in a segregated client account or depository and separate
from its corporate funds, and will not voluntarily make it available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Shareholder Representative is not
providing any investment supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have
no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Representative
Reimbursement Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Representative Reimbursement Amount shall only be used
for the payment of the Shareholder Representative Expenses or as otherwise
required by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any Representative
Engagement Agreement or any other Related Agreement. The Participating Rights
Holders and the Founders acknowledge that the Shareholder Representative shall
not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur
any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or administration of its duties.

 

(d) _Release from Liability; Indemnification; Authority of Shareholder
Representative_. Certain Participating Rights Holders have entered into an
engagement agreement with the Shareholder Representative to provide direction
to the Shareholder Representative in connection with the performance of its
services under this Agreement and the Related Agreements (such Participating
Rights Holders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). By virtue of the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the ISR Merger by the Valor
Shareholders, each Participating Rights Holder shall (and by acceptance of
any payment under this Agreement or the Related Agreements the Founders shall)
be deemed to hereby release the Shareholder Representative (together with its
members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents, employees and
other Representatives), and each member of its Advisory Group (collectively,
the " _Shareholder Representative Group_ "), from, and each Participating
Rights Holder and each Founder, by virtue of such adoption and approval or
acceptance, as applicable, shall be further deemed to agree to

 



37  indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholder Representative Group
against, liability for any action taken or not taken by him, her or it in his,
her or its capacity as the Shareholder Representative Group, except for the
liability of the Shareholder Representative Group, or any member thereof, to a
Participating Rights Holder or a Founder for loss which such holder may suffer
from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Shareholder
Representative Group or such member in carrying out his, her or its duties
hereunder. Each Founder, and by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the ISR Merger by the Valor Shareholders, each Participating
Rights Holder (regardless of whether or not such Participating Rights Holder
votes in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the ISR
Merger, whether at a meeting or by written consent in lieu thereof) shall be
deemed to appoint, as of the ISR Effective Time, the Shareholder
Representative as his, her or its true and lawful exclusive agent and
attorney-in-fact to enter into any agreement in connection with the
Transactions, the Escrow Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement,
to exercise all or any of the powers, authority and discretion conferred on
him, her or it under any such agreement, to give and receive notices on their
behalf and to be his, her or its exclusive representative with respect to any
matter, suit, claim, action or proceeding arising with respect to any
transaction contemplated by any such agreement, including, without limitation,
the defense, settlement or compromise of any claim, action or proceeding for
which Holdco, the ISR Surviving Company or the US Surviving Corporation may
be entitled to indemnification and, by virtue of its approval of this
Agreement, the Shareholder Representative agrees to act as, and to undertake
the duties and responsibilities of, such exclusive agent and attorney-in-
fact. This power of attorney as well as the powers, immunities and rights to
indemnification granted to the Shareholder Representative Group hereunder are
coupled with an interest and irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective Participating
Rights Holder and shall be binding on any successor thereto. Each
Participating Rights Holder and each Founder (i) agrees that all actions,
decisions and instructions of the Shareholder Representative shall be
conclusive and binding upon all of the Participating Rights Holders and
Founders and each such Persons successors, and (ii) waives any and all
defenses which may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of
the Shareholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the
Related Agreements.

(e) _Distribution of Representative Reimbursement Amount_. The entirety of
the Representative Reimbursement Amount that has not been consumed by the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the date
that is the ninetieth (90th) day following the date on which the final
Contingent Payment is due and paid or, if later, the date on which all
indemnification claims of the Holdco Indemnitees outstanding at the end of
such period have been discharged in full, shall be distributed by the
Shareholder Representative to the Exchange Agent for further distribution to
the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders in accordance with each such
Persons Pro Rata Share.

 

3.8 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the ISR Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to effectuate the Transactions and
to vest Holdco, the ISR Surviving Company and the US Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of Valor, the ISR Merger Sub, HW and the US
Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Holdco, the ISR Surviving Company
and the US Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of Valor,
the ISR Merger Sub, HW and the US Merger Sub or otherwise to take, and shall
take, all such action.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING VALOR

 

Valor hereby represents and warrants to the other parties hereto as follows as

specified herein); _provided_ , that such representations and warranties shall
be qualified by the attached Disclosure Schedule of Valor (the " _Valor
Disclosure Schedule_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or the Valor Disclosure Schedule, each disclosure set forth in
the Valor Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to qualify each representation
and warranty of Valor set forth in this Agreement (i) that is specifically
identified (by cross-reference, section heading or otherwise) in the Valor
Disclosure Schedule as being qualified by such disclosure or (ii)
(notwithstanding the absence of an appropriate cross-reference or section
heading) with respect to which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. In addition, for purposes of
determining accuracy as of the Closing Date of the representations and
warranties of Valor under _Section 4.3_ hereof only, the _Valor Disclosure
Schedule_ shall be deemed to have been updated by the information set forth in
the Capitalization and Closing Adjustment Amount Statement.

 

4.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Valor and Mitral
is a private company duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of
Israel and has all requisite company power and authority to carry on the Valor
Business. ValCo is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on the Valor Business. Each
of Valor and its Subsidiaries has not been dissolved and is not in the process
of being dissolved by any company resolutions or other action by its directors

equity holders, (y) any Governmental Authority or (z) otherwise. _Section 4.1
of the Valor Disclosure Schedule_ lists the names of the directors and
officers (or members of similar governing bodies), together with their
titles, of Valor and its Subsidiaries. Valor and its Subsidiaries are duly
qualified or licensed to transact business in each jurisdiction in which its
ownership of property or assets or the conduct of its business as now
conducted makes such qualification necessary, other than any such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Valor. Each of Valor and its Subsidiaries has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Related Agreements to the extent it is a party, and to perform its obligations
under, and to carry out the provisions of, this Agreement and the Related
Agreements.

4.2 _Subsidiaries_. Valor does not have, and has not ever had
any Subsidiaries other than Mitral and ValCo, and does not presently own or
control, directly or indirectly, any interest in any other corporation,
association, partnership, limited liability company or other business entity.
Valor is not, and has never been, a participant in any joint venture or
similar arrangement. Valor is not, and has not been, a general partner of, nor
is it responsible or liable for any of the debts or other obligations of, any
other person. As of the date hereof, all Interests in ValCo and Interests in
Mitral are held as set forth on _Section 4.2 of the Valor Disclosure
Schedule_. As of the Closing Date, Valor owns all of the Interests in ValCo
and Interests in Mitral (other than the Interests in Mitral held by the
Founders as set forth in _Section 4.2 of the Valor Disclosure Schedule_) free
and clear of any liens, encumbrances or other continuing rights or
obligations; _provided_ , that any such Interests in Mitral held by
the Founders may be acquired by Valor between the Agreement Date and the ISR
Effective Time.

instruments of any kind, including convertible debt instruments, for the
purchase or acquisition from Valor or its Subsidiaries of any of their
Securities. Valor and its Subsidiaries are not a party or subject to any
agreement or understanding and, to the Knowledge of Valor, there is no
agreement or understanding between any other persons, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements, (i) that affects
or relates to the voting or giving of written consents with respect to any
Security other than as contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) with respect to
the issuance by Valor or its Subsidiaries, or the sale or transfer between

(c) All of the issued and outstanding shares of Valor and its Subsidiaries (i)
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable, and (ii) were issued in material compliance with all applicable
Laws concerning the issuance of securities. All Valor Options were issued in

effected by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval
by the Valor Board (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof)
and any required shareholder approval by the necessary number of votes or
written consents; such grant was made in material compliance with the terms of
the Valor Option Plan. All Valor Options have been validly issued, properly
approved by the Valor Board (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee
thereof) and with respect to Valor 102 Options, deposited with the Section 102
Trustee, in compliance with all applicable Law. All of the Valor Ordinary
Shares that may be issued upon conversion of the Valor Preferred Shares or
pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Valor Options will, when and if
issued, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. To
the Knowledge of Valor, each Participating Rights Holder of record and, to
the extent the exchange described in _Section 8.11_ does not occur prior to
the ISR Effective Time, each Founder owns all beneficial interests in such
Participating Rights Holders or Founders Securities of Valor or Mitral, as
applicable, as set forth on _Section 4.3(b) of the Valor Disclosure
Schedule_.

 

(d) Each series of Valor Preferred Shares is presently convertible into Valor
Ordinary Shares (other than the Series S Preferred Shares) at the conversion
ratio provided in the Valor Charter, and the consummation of the ISR Merger,
the US Merger or the other Transactions will not result in any anti-dilution
adjustment or other similar adjustment to the outstanding Valor
Preferred Shares.

4.4 _Authorization; Binding Obligations; Governmental Consents_.

 

(a) All corporate actions on the part of Valor and its Subsidiaries necessary
for the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Related Agreements, the performance of all obligations of Valor and its
Subsidiaries hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

date of their employment and on the basis of their entire salary including
other compensation (e.g., commission), main work location, notice period
entitlement, share options, if any, or rights, such employees employer, date
of employment and position; _provided_ that, to the extent applicable privacy
or data protection Laws would prohibit the disclosure of certain Personal Data
without the individuals consent,  _Section 4.15(a) of the Valor Disclosure

information in de-identified form in compliance with applicable Laws. Other

Law and the respective employment contracts, such employees are not entitled
to additional material benefits. Other than in the ordinary course of

contract, consulting contract, proprietary information agreement or any other
agreement relating to the right of any such individual to be employed by, or
to contract with, Valor or such Subsidiary because of the nature of the Valor
Business; and, to the Knowledge of Valor, the continued employment by Valor
and its Subsidiaries of its present

 



55  employees, and the performance of the contracts of Valor and its
Subsidiaries with its independent contractors, will not result in any such
violation. As of the Agreement Date, neither Valor nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice alleging that any such violation
has occurred. No employee of Valor or its Subsidiaries has been granted the
right to continued employment or engagement by Valor or its Subsidiaries or to
any material compensation following termination of employment with Valor

incentive compensation or benefits accrued prior to the date of such
termination or as required by applicable Law). As of the Agreement Date, no
officer or Key Employee or key consultant has provided written notice to Valor

no written formal grievances, complaints or charges with respect to employment

administrative forum, under any private dispute resolution procedure or
internally; (iv) at all times since January 1, 2013, none of the employment

Laws. To the Knowledge of Valor, there is no charge, proceeding or claim with
respect to a violation of any occupational safety or health standards that has
been asserted or is now pending or threatened with respect to Valor. To the
Knowledge of Valor, there is no charge of discrimination in employment or
employment practices, for any reason, including age, gender, race, religion,
or other legally protected category, which has been asserted or is now
pending or threatened before any Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction in

threatened between any of Valor or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
of their respective current or former employees or other service providers, on
the other hand, which controversies,

Material Adverse Effect on Valor. To the Knowledge of Valor, except as listed
on _Section 4.15(c) of Valor Disclosure Schedule_ (1) no employees of any of

organization, works council, worker center or other representative body in

independent contractors whose employment would require special licenses,

required, prior advance notice periods and accrued vacation days), other than
those included in the Valor Employee Benefit Plans or in _Section 4.15(d) of

Laws, 5728-1968 (the " _Israeli Securities Law_ "), regarding the offering of

from the Israel Securities Authority based on the Form S-4 Registration
Statement or obtaining another valid exemption from the requirement to publish
an Israeli prospectus under the Israeli Securities Law. Each of the parties

Obligated Valor Shareholder to pay the OCS Loan Amount to the OCS, and (ii)
attempt to pay, or cause to be paid, the OCS Grant Amount to the OCS and
obtain the OCS Settlement in connection therewith, _provided_ , that in no
event shall any such OCS Settlement obtained by Valor or the Shareholder
Representative require the payment by Valor or Holdco of any amount in excess
of the OCS Maximum Amount. In the event that, and only in the event that, the
amounts described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) have not been paid on

8.10 _Further Assurances_. 

(a) From the Agreement Date until the earlier of (x) the later of ISR
Effective Time or the Effective Time and (y) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 10.1_, each of HW and Valor will:

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the ISR Merger, the US Merger and the other Transactions,
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Permits,
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental
Authorities as are necessary for the consummation of the ISR Merger, the US
Merger or the other Transactions and to fulfill the conditions set forth in
_Article 9_ ; _provided_ , that HW shall not be required by _Section 8.9_ or
this _Section 8.10(a)_ to enter into any consent decree, hold separate
orders or other similar arrangements, including any such consent decree, hold
separate order or other arrangements that would require Holdco, HW or Valor to
dispose of any material existing assets of such party (including granting a
license to any assets to a third party), or any other arrangement that would
limit in any material respect the ability of Holdco to conduct its business;
and

 

(ii) cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts to vigorously
contest and resist any action, including administrative or judicial action,
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the
ISR Merger, the US Merger and the other Transactions, including by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

 

(b) From the Agreement Date until the earlier of (x) the later of ISR
Effective Time or the Effective Time and (y) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 10.1_, without limiting any of the other provisions
of this Agreement, each of HW and Valor shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, (i) take all further action that is necessary or
desirable to

 



87  carry out the purposes of this Agreement and (ii) refrain from taking any
actions which (A) would be contrary to, inconsistent with or against, or would
frustrate the essential purposes of, the Transactions or (B) could reasonably
be expected to impair, delay or impede the Closing (including the acquisition
or proposed acquisition of the equity interests or assets of any person, which
acquisition or proposed acquisition would reasonably be expected to impair,
delay or impede the Closing).

8.11 _Mitral_. Prior to the Closing Date, Valor shall timely provide the
Valtech Sale Notice (as defined in the Mitral Purchase Agreement) in respect
of the Transactions to the Founders. The Valtech Sale Notice, which shall be
provided to HW prior to sending and shall incorporate any of HWs reasonable
comments, shall: (i) include the Company Valuation (as defined in the Mitral
Purchase Agreement), expressed as a monetary amount and a percentage of the
Merger Consideration; (ii) specify that the Call Option (as defined in Section
9.2 of the Mitral Purchase Agreement) is being exercised by Valor with
respect to all Interests in Mitral held by the Founders; and (iii) specify,
based on the Company Valuation, the aggregate consideration to be paid to the
Founders in respect of the Call Option (the " _Founders  Portion_"), which
consideration shall be deducted from the Merger Consideration payable
hereunder pursuant to the terms hereof solely to the extent such payment is
due to the Founders in respect of the Call Option. At any time prior to the
ISR Effective Time, Valor may exchange any Interests in Mitral held by the
Founders for shares of Valor Capital Stock. In the event of any such exchange,
any such Founder that receives shares of Valor Capital Stock in exchange for
Interests in Mitral shall be deemed to be a Participating Rights Holder for
all purposes hereunder and under any Related Agreement and the Founders
Portion shall be proportionately reduced. At the ISR Effective Time, Holdco
shall, on behalf of Valor, deliver and issue the Deducted Closing Holdco
Shares and the Deducted Warrants to the Founders, on a pro rata basis based on
each such Founders ownership percentage as of immediately prior to the
ISR Effective Time of all Interests in Mitral (on a fully diluted basis)
outstanding as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time. Concurrently
with the payment of any Contingent Payment to any Participating Rights Holder,
Holdco shall pay the Founders Portion of such Contingent Payment to the
Founders, on a pro rata basis based on each such Founders ownership
percentage as of immediately prior to the ISR Effective Time of all Interests
in Mitral (on a fully diluted basis) outstanding as of immediately prior to
the ISR Effective Time. Any payments due to the Founders hereunder shall be
deposited with the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, to hold
and distribute pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Exchange Agent
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, as applicable. In the event that any
portion of the foregoing consideration paid to the Exchange Agent or the
Escrow Agent on behalf of a Founder is subject to an attachment imposed by a
court (the " _Attached Consideration_ "), the Exchange Agent or the Escrow
Agent, as applicable, shall not release the Attached Consideration except
pursuant to such courts instructions or pursuant to a settlement agreement
entered as a judgment before such court. For the avoidance of doubt, Holdco
shall have satisfied its payment obligations in respect of the Attached
Consideration upon release thereof by the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent
in compliance with the immediately preceding sentence. Valor shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Founder to seek court
approval for the transfer of the Interests in Mitral which are the subject of
the Attached Consideration.

connection with the matters described in _Section 8.12 of the Valor

purposes of determining whether Holdco and its Affiliates have satisfied any

except as to disclose the existence of these provisions, including in response

records, contracts and documents and appropriate personnel of Valor as HW and
its Representatives may reasonably request (including employees, attorneys,
accountants, consultants, physicians performing research and development
activities with respect to the Valor Products and other professionals, in
each case to the extent the provision of such access is under the control of
Valor), and Valor will furnish or cause to be furnished to HW and its
Representatives all such information with respect to the affairs
and businesses of Valor (including Valors development programs and clinical

required to provide any access to any book, record, contract or document or
provide any information (a) that is subject to an attorney-client or other
legal privilege that might be impaired by such disclosure ( _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Valor shall use its reasonable efforts to redact or otherwise
provide such book, record, contract, document or information in a manner that
does not jeopardize such attorney-client or other legal privilege), or (b) if

statements with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions at any time. HW
shall not make any public statements (whether or not filed with any Person)
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions unless such statements are
consistent with the HW Board Recommendation; _provided_ , that that nothing in

Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors and officers of
Valor and its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") as provided in
the Valor Charter, the governing documents of Valors Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreements specifically identified in _Section 8.18(a) of the
Valor Disclosure Schedule_ between Valor or any of its Subsidiaries and any of
the DandO Indemnified Parties (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof
or, if amended between the date hereof and the ISR Effective Time pursuant to
_Section 7.1 of the Valor Disclosure Schedule_, in effect as of the ISR
Effective Time) shall be assumed by the ISR Surviving Company in the ISR
Merger, without further action, as of the ISR Effective Time and shall survive
the ISR Merger and shall continue in full force and effect to the fullest
extent allowable under applicable Law, and Holdco shall cause the ISR
Surviving Company to so honor such agreements, including, to the extent
necessary, by providing funds to ensure compliance therewith. Without limiting
the foregoing, Holdco, from and after the ISR Effective Time until at least
seven (7) years from the ISR Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, the Articles of Association of ISR Surviving
Company and the governing documents of its Subsidiaries (to the extent such
Subsidiaries exist as of the ISR Effective Time) to contain provisions no
less favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to exculpation and
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers, insurance and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Valor Charter and the governing documents of Valors Subsidiaries, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnified
Parties with respect to exculpation and limitation of liabilities or insurance
and indemnification, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 



91 (b) Effective as of the Closing, Valor shall, on behalf of the ISR Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent such Subsidiaries exist as of the
ISR Effective Time), purchase and obtain an extended reporting period
endorsement of Valors and its Subsidiaries current directors and officers
liability insurance in respect of acts, omissions or other matters occurring
or existing at or prior to the ISR Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions) covering the DandO Indemnified Parties
currently covered by Valors and its Subsidiaries directors and officers
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount
no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for
a period of seven (7) years following the ISR Effective Time (the " _Tail D andO
Policy_"). Following the ISR Effective Time, the Holdco Group shall not cancel
the Tail DandO Policy and shall honor its obligations thereunder, if any.

(c) The obligations under this _Section 8.18_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party
without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Party (it being expressly
agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties (and their respective heirs
or representatives) shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
8.18_), and in the event that Holdco consolidates or merges with any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger, then Holdco shall make proper provision so that
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 8.18_.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 8.18_ shall be deemed to limit the rights of HW
under _Section 11.2_.

 

8.19 _280G Matters_. Valor shall, prior to the Closing: (a) use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure from each person who is a "disqualified
individual" under Section 280G(c) of the Code and who has a right to any
severance payments, accelerated vesting and payment of options and other
payments, which could reasonably be deemed to constitute "parachute payments"
under Section 280G of the Code (the " _Potential 280G Payments_ "), a waiver
of such persons rights to a portion of the potential 280G benefits (the "
_Waived Benefits_ ") so that all remaining Potential 280G Payments applicable
to such person shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" that would not
be deductible under Section 280G of the Code and subject to the imposition of
additional Tax under Section 4999 of the Code; and (b) seek approval of its
stockholders of payment of the Waived Benefits in a manner that is intended to
comply with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section
1.280G-1 (the " _280G Approval_ "). In addition, Valor shall deliver to HW,
prior to seeking the 280G Approval, drafts of such 280G Approval and related
analysis, for HWs review and comment, in order to ensure that HW is
reasonably satisfied that the 280G Approval of the Waived Benefits will be
solicited in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.280G-1. To the extent that the 280G Approval is not
obtained with respect to any Waived Benefits for which Valor has received a
waiver pursuant to clause (a) above, Valor will not pay any such Waived
Benefits.

 



92 8.20 _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium" or "control share
acquisition" statute or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
shall become applicable to the Transactions, each of the parties hereto and
their respective Boards of Directors shall use their reasonable best efforts
to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of
any such statute or regulation on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

8.21 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Valor shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of Valor and its Subsidiaries that
are required to be filed (taking into account any applicable extension) on or
before the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of
Valor and its Subsidiaries due on or before the Closing Date. Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the past practices of Valor and its Subsidiaries with
respect to such items, except as required by applicable Law. At least fifteen
(15) days prior to filing any such Tax Return, Valor shall deliver copies of
all income and other material Tax Returns to be filed pursuant to this
_Section 8.21(a)(i)_ for HWs review and comment and Valor will reflect all
reasonable comments made by HW on such Tax Returns.

(ii) Holdco shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of Valor and its Subsidiaries that
relate to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date but that are
required to be filed (taking into account any applicable extension) after the
Closing Date. If such Tax Returns reflect a Tax for which the Participating
Rights Holders and Founders could be liable pursuant to _Article 11_ , Holdco
shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to the Shareholder Representative for
the Shareholder Representatives review and comment at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date (taking into account any extension) for the filing
of such Tax Returns, and Holdco shall incorporate any reasonable comment that
the Shareholder Representative submits to Holdco no less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns.

(iii) Holdco shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, any Tax Return of Valor and its Subsidiaries that is due after
the Closing Date and which relate to any taxable period beginning prior to the
Closing Date (including any Straddle Period). If such Tax Returns reflect a
Tax for which the Participating Rights Holders and Founders could be liable
pursuant to _Article 11_ , Holdco shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to
the Shareholder Representative for the Shareholder Representatives
review and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date (taking
into account any extension) for the filing of such Tax Returns, and shall
incorporate any reasonable comments that the Shareholder Representative
submits to Holdco no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date
of such Tax Returns.

 



93 (iv) With respect to Taxes of Valor and its Subsidiaries relating to a
Straddle Period, the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period that is deemed to end on the close of business on the Closing
Date shall be subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(d)_
hereof. The portion of any Tax that is allocable to the taxable period that
is deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (A) in the case of Property
Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B)
in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of
Valor terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

(b) _Cooperation_. Holdco and the Shareholder Representative agree to furnish
or cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to Taxes, including,
without limitation, access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of all Tax Returns by Holdco and Valor and their Subsidiaries,
the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by
any Taxation Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax. Each of Holdco and the Shareholder
Representative shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes of
Valor and its Subsidiaries for a period of at least seven (7) years following
the Closing Date.

(c) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) After the Closing, Holdco and Valor, on the one hand, and the Shareholder
Representative, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon
receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments,
audits or similar events with respect to Taxes of Valor relating to any Taxes
for which Participating Rights Holders and Founders could be liable under
_Section 11.2_ (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event,
a " _Tax Matter_ "). Any failure to so notify the other party of any Tax
Matter shall not relieve such other party of any liability with respect to
such Tax Matters except to the extent such party was actually prejudiced as a
result thereof.

(ii)

 

(A) Holdco shall promptly notify the Shareholder Representative upon receipt
of notice of any pending or threatened Tax Matter for which the Participating
Rights Holders and the Founders (or any of their respective Affiliates) may be
liable under _Section 11.2_. The Shareholder Representative will have the
right to assume the defense of any Tax Matter with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to Holdco by written notice to Holdco within thirty
(30) days after the Shareholder Representative has received notice of the Tax
Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholder Representative must
continue to conduct the defense with reasonable diligence thereafter in order
to preserve their rights to control such defense; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Holdco may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense (but not control such defense) of the Tax
Matter.

 



94 (B) The Shareholder Representative will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Tax Matter without
the prior written consent of Holdco (which consent will not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), provided that Holdcos consent shall not be
required if the judgment or proposed settlement (i) includes an unconditional
release of all liability of Holdco with respect to such Tax Matter, (ii)
involves only the payment of damages that are fully covered by the
Participating Rights Holders and the Founders (including amounts deemed to be
paid pursuant to a future set-off), and (iii) does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief upon Holdco or subject Holdco to criminal liability.
Holdco will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Tax Matter without the prior written consent of
the Shareholder Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed).

 

(C) In the event that the Shareholder Representative fails to assume or have
no further right to conduct the defense of any Tax Matter in accordance with
_Section 8.21(c)(ii)(A)_, Holdco may assume the defense of the Tax Matter in
any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate but shall not be entitled to
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to such Tax Matter without the prior written consent of the
Shareholder Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that, the
Shareholder Representative may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost
and expense and participate in the defense of the Tax Matter.

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements between Valor or any Subsidiary of Valor, on the one hand, and any
of the Valor Shareholders and their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be
terminated prior to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, the ISR
Surviving Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

(e) _Code Section 351/368 Transaction_. The parties hereto intend for (i)
the US Merger and the ISR Merger, taken together, to qualify as an exchange
satisfying the requirements of Section 351 of the Code, and (ii) the US Merger
to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. The parties hereto will not take any position on any federal, state, or
local income or franchise tax return, or take any tax reporting position, that
is inconsistent with the foregoing, unless otherwise required by a
"determination" (as defined by Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code) or by
applicable state or local income or franchise tax law. The parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the US Merger and the ISR Merger,
taken together, to qualify as an exchange satisfying the requirements of
Section 351 of the Code, and (ii) the US Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither HW
nor Valor shall knowingly take or fail to take (and, following the
Transactions, Holdco will cause HW and Valor not to knowingly take or fail to
take) any action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be
expected to (i) cause the US Merger and the ISR Merger, taken together, to
fail to qualify as an exchange within the meaning of Section 351 of the Code,
or (ii) cause the US Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of HW, Valor, Holdco, ISR
Merger Sub and US Merger Sub shall deliver such officers certificates as may
be reasonably required by 

 



95  Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to HW, and Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP,
counsel to Valor, at the time of the filing of the Form S-4 Registration
Statement (and of each amendment or supplement thereto, as applicable) in
connection with the tax matters addressed in the Form S-4 Registration
Statement and in connection with the opinions of counsel referred to in
_Sections 9.2(f)_ and 9.3(e). HW and Valor shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in _Sections 9.2(f)_ and
_9.3(e)_ , respectively.

(f)  _ISR Merger Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales,
use, registration, goods and services, harmonized sales, recording, filing,
value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate
transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with the ISR Merger shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Holdco and fifty percent (50%) by the Participating
Rights Holders and Founders.

 

(g) _Conflict_. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions
of this _Section 8.21_ and _Article 11_ , the provisions of this _Section
8.21_ shall control.

(h) _Israeli Tax Ruling_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement,
legal counsel for Valor, in full coordination with legal counsel of HW, will
approach the ITA with an application for a ruling (the " _Israeli Options Tax
Ruling_ ") in relation to the tax treatment of Valor 102 Shares, Valor 102
Options and Valor 3(i) Options (to the extent not exercised prior to the
Closing) within the scope of this Agreement, to confirm, among others, that
(i) Holdco and anyone acting on its behalf shall not be required to withhold
Israeli Taxes in relation to any consideration payable in respect of Valor
102 Shares, Valor 102 Options and Valor 3(i) Options where such consideration
is transferred to the Section 102 Trustee to be held and distributed by the
Section 102 Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Israeli Options Tax Ruling;
(ii) the payment of consideration for Valor 102 Shares and Valor 102 Options
which have not yet completed the "requisite holding period" (as such term is
defined in Section 102 of the Israeli Tax Code) shall not constitute a
violation of Section 102 of the Israeli Tax Code as long as such consideration
is deposited with the Section 102 Trustee; and (iii) any contingent payment
expected to be made in the future in respect of Valor 102 Shares, Valor 102
Options and Valor 3(i) Options shall not be subject to Israeli Tax until
actually paid to the Section 102 Trustee (which ruling may be subject to
customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling). If the Israeli
Options Tax Ruling is not granted prior to the Closing, Valor shall seek to
receive prior to the Closing an interim tax ruling confirming, among other
things, that Holdco and anyone acting on its behalf shall be exempt from
Israeli withholding Tax in relation to any consideration payable with respect
to Valor 102 Shares, Valor 102 Options and Valor 3(i) Options (to the extent
not exercised prior to the Closing) (which ruling may be subject to customary
conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (the " _Israeli Options
Interim Tax Ruling_ "), where such consideration is transferred to the Section
102 Trustee to be held and distributed by the Section 102 Trustee pursuant to
the terms of the Israeli Options Interim Tax Ruling or the Israeli Options Tax
Ruling to be obtained following the Closing. Each of HW and Valor shall, and
shall cause their respective Israeli legal counsel to, coordinate
and cooperate with each other with respect to the preparation of any written
or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Israeli Options Tax Ruling or the Israeli Options Interim Tax Ruling, as
applicable. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Valor shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to obtain the Israeli Options Interim Tax
Ruling and

 



96  the Israeli Options Tax Ruling as promptly as practicable. The final text of
the Israeli Options Tax Ruling or the Israeli Options Interim Tax Ruling shall
in all circumstances be subject to the prior written confirmation of HW or
its counsel.

8.22 _Conduct of Business_. From and after the date hereof until the
Effective Time, neither Holdco, ISR Merger Sub nor US Merger Sub shall
conduct any business other than activities incidental to the consummation of
the Transactions or otherwise permitted hereby.

 

8.23 _Interim Funding_. If Valors cash balances are equal to $1,000,000 or
less at any time following the date hereof and prior to the ISR Effective
Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
10_ , Valor may provide written notice thereof to HW. In the event that Valor
delivers such written notice to HW, HW shall make a loan to Valor in the
principal amount of $1,000,000 pursuant to Interim Funding Convertible
Promissory Notes in the form of _Exhibit F_ attached hereto no later than five
(5) days following receipt by HW of such notice (each such Interim
Funding Convertible Promissory Note, a " _Subsequent HW Note_ "). In no event
shall HW be required to make more than make more than one such loan to Valor
in any thirty (30) day period. The proceeds of all loans made to Valor
pursuant to this _Section 8.23_ shall not be used by Valor in a manner that
violates _Section 7.1_.

8.24 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) During the period beginning on the ISR Effective Time and ending on the
first (1st) anniversary of the ISR Effective Time, Holdco shall provide, or
shall cause the ISR Surviving Company to provide, employees who continue to be
employed by the Holdco Group (collectively, " _Continuing Employees_ ") with
the salary or hourly wage rate and annual incentive compensation
opportunities as provided to either (i) such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the ISR Effective Time or (ii) similarly situated employees of HW,
and with employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that are
either (A) substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits
provided under the Valor Employee Benefit Plans or under any other benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement in which such Continuing
Employees participated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Old Plans_ ")
or (B) substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits
available to similarly situated employees of HW under Holdcos and HWs
benefit plans and programs. Holdco further agrees that, from and after the ISR
Effective Time, Holdco shall, and shall cause the ISR Surviving Company to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize service with Valor or any of
its Subsidiaries that a Continuing Employee earned prior to the ISR Effective
Time for eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual purposes (excluding benefit
accruals under any defined benefit plan) under any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement or arrangement in which the Continuing Employees
commence to participate on or after the ISR Effective Time (collectively, the
" _New Plans_ "), except for (i) New Plans as to which employees who are
similarly situated to the Continuing Employees are not provided such service
credit or (ii) as would result in duplication of benefits. In addition, Holdco
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause to be waived all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and similar
limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any New Plans to the extent
waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee under any Valor Employee Benefit
Plan or under any other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement as of the date on which commencement of participation in such New
Plan begins, unless and to the extent the individual,

 



97  immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such conditions
under the comparable Old Plans, and (y) cause any deductible, co-insurance and
covered out-of-pocket expenses paid during the calendar year in which
commencement of participation in such New Plan begins and prior to such
commencement of participation by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent
thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket
provisions under such New Plan in the year of initial participation.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement, including without limitation, this
_Section 8.24_, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee any right
to continued employment or service for any period, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Holdco or HW or any Affiliate of HW, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any employee of Valor of its Subsidiaries at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Further, nothing contained in this
Agreement, including without limitation, this _Section 8.24_, express or
implied, shall confer upon any employee any right to continued receipt of any
specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other
modification of any New Plan, Old Plan or Valor Employee Benefit Plan or
employee benefit plan of Holdco or HW or other benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement. Further, this _Section 8.24_ shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this
Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 8.24_, express or implied, shall
create any third party rights in any current or former service provider
or employee of Holdco, HW, Valor or any of their respective Affiliates (or
any beneficiaries or dependents thereof) or confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 8.24_.

TERMINATION

10.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
may be abandoned at any time prior to the ISR Effective Time, notwithstanding
any requisite approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by
the stockholders of HW or the Valor Shareholders:

(a) by duly authorized mutual written consent executed by each of HW and
Valor;

 

(b) by HW or by Valor (by written notice to the other), if the ISR Effective
Time shall not have occurred before the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day
following the Agreement Date (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) if on the Termination Date any condition set forth in
_Section 9.1(b)_, _Section 9.1(e)_,  _Section 9.1(f)_, or _Section
9.1(d)_) has not been satisfied, and the Closing has not occurred due to the
failure of any such condition

 



101  to be satisfied, then the Termination Date shall be automatically extended,
without further action of the parties, until the tenth (10th) business day
after the date on which such condition has been satisfied ( _provided_ , that
in no event shall the Termination Date be extended later than April 1, 2016),
and (ii) the right to terminate or extend this Agreement under this _Section
10.1(b)_ shall not be available to HW in the event that the failure of the
ISR Effective Time to occur on or before such date principally arises out of
or is related to the failure of HW, Holdco, ISR Merger Sub or US Merger Sub to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement, and the right to terminate or
extend this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to
Valor in the event that the failure of the ISR Effective Time to occur on or
before such date principally arises out of or is related to the failure by
Valor to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement;

(c) automatically if there shall be any applicable Law that
makes consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited or if
any court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Authority shall have
issued an Order or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and such Order or ruling or other
action shall have become final and non-appealable;

(d) by HW (by written notice to Valor) if (i) any representation or warranty
of Valor contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate or shall have been
breached such that the condition set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_ would not be
satisfied; or (ii) any of the covenants or obligations of Valor contained in
this Agreement shall have been breached in any material respect such that the
condition set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of Valor or a breach of a covenant by Valor is capable of being cured
during the 30-day period after HW notifies Valor in writing of the existence
of such inaccuracy or breach (the " _Valor Cure Period_ "), then HW may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.1(d)_ as a result of such
inaccuracy or breach prior to the expiration of the Valor Cure Period (it
being understood that HW may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.1(d)_ if any of HW, Holdco, US Merger Sub or ISR Merger Sub is in
material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement or if such
breach by Valor is cured such that such conditions would then be satisfied);

(e) by Valor (by written notice to HW) if: (i) any representation or warranty
of HW contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate or shall have been
breached such that the condition set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ would not be
satisfied; or (ii) any of the covenants or obligations of HW, Holdco, US
Merger Sub or ISR Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall have been
breached in any material respect such that the condition set forth in _Section
9.3(a)_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that if an inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty of HW or a breach of a
covenant by any such person is capable of being cured during the 30-day period
after Valor notifies HW in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or
breach (the " _HW Cure Period_ "), then Valor may not terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 10.1(e)_ as a result of such inaccuracy or
breach prior to the expiration of the HW Cure Period (it being understood that
Valor may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 10.1(e)_
if Valor is in material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement
or if such breach by HW is cured such that such conditions would then be
satisfied);

 



102 (f) by HW (by written notice to Valor) if, within fifteen (15) days after the
Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act, the Required Valor Shareholder Vote has not been obtained;

(g) by HW or by Valor (by written notice to the other) if (i) the HW
Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournments and postponements thereof)
shall have been held and completed and HWs stockholders shall have taken a
final vote on the Transactions and (ii) the Transactions shall not have been
approved at the HW Stockholders Meeting (and shall not have been approved at
any adjournment or postponement thereof) by the Required HW Stockholder Vote;

 

(h) by HW (by written notice to Valor) within fifteen (15) days following the
date on which a Change of Recommendation is effected;

 

(i) by Valor (by written notice to HW) within fifteen (15) days following the
date of delivery of the Change of Recommendation Notice to Valor or, if no
such notice is provided, within fifteen (15) days following the date on which
Valor actually becomes aware that a Change of Recommendation has been effected
or has occurred; or

 

(j) by Valor (by written notice to HW) if HW breaches its obligation to make a
loan to Valor pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 8.23_ within ten (10)
days following written notice from Valor specifying such breach.

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the valid termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 10.1_, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other parties specifying
the provision of  _Section 10.1_ pursuant to which such termination is made,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void, there shall be no liability under
this Agreement on the part of HW, Valor or any other party hereto or any of
their respective officers, directors, shareholders or Affiliates, and all
rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except for damages and
liabilities (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out of pocket costs, and can be based on the
actual and/or potential damages incurred in the event such party (or, in the
case of Valor, the Participating Rights Holders or the Founders) would not
receive the benefit of the bargain as set forth in this Agreement, taking
into consideration relevant matters including other transactions or other
opportunities and the time value of money) arising from fraud; _provided_ ,
(a) that the provisions of this _Article 10_ , _Article 12_ and
the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement
for any reason; and (b) in the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 10.1_, then HW shall, within three (3) business days of
the date on which written notice of such termination is provided, make a loan
to Valor in a principal amount equal to $30,000,000 pursuant to the
Convertible Promissory Note in the form of _Exhibit G_ attached hereto (the "
_HW Termination Note_ ") as Valors sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement, other than damages and liabilities arising from fraud. The parties
each agree that this _Section 10.2_ is an integral part of the Transactions,
and that, without the agreements in this _Section 10.2_, Valor would not
have entered into this Agreement.

 



103 ARTICLE 11

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND SET-OFF RIGHTS

 

11.1 _Indemnification by Holdco_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 11.5_ hereof, from and after the ISR Effective Time, Holdco will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Valor Shareholders, the other
Participating Rights Holders and the Founders and each of their respective
Affiliates, from and against any and all Damages to the extent arising out of
or resulting from any breach by Holdco or HW of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking made by Holdco, HW, US Merger
Sub, ISR Merger Sub, the US Surviving Corporation or the ISR Surviving
Company in this Agreement (including any certificate delivered hereunder).

11.2 _Indemnification by the Participating Rights Holders and Founders;
Holdco Set-Off Rights_. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
11.5_ hereof, by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Transactions by the Valor Shareholders, from and after the ISR Effective
Time, each of the Participating Rights Holders and each of the Founders
(regardless of whether or not such Participating Rights Holder has actually
voted his, her or its Securities of Valor in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the ISR Merger) shall severally and with
respect to himself, herself or itself only, in accordance with and only to the
extent of each such Persons Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Shares and Pro
Rata Share of portions of the CE Mark Contingent Payment, the First-in-Man
Contingent Payment and the Net Sales Contingent Payment prior to the payment
thereof, if any and as applicable, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Holdco, its Affiliates, including the ISR Surviving Company and the US
Surviving Corporation (collectively, the " _Holdco Indemnitees_ "), from and
against any and all Damages to the extent arising out of or resulting from:

 

(a) any breach by Valor of any representation or warranty made by Valor in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Valor pursuant to this
Agreement; _provided_ , that for purposes of determining the amount of Damages
with respect to any such breach of representations or warranties (but not
whether such breach exists), such Damages shall be determined, in each case,
as if all qualifications as to materiality, including, each reference to the
defined term Material Adverse Effect, were deleted from such representations
and warranties;

 

(b) any breach by Valor of any covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking
made by Valor in this Agreement that is to be performed at or prior to
Closing;

(c) regardless of any disclosure on the _Valor Disclosure Schedule_ , any
claim, allegation or assertion by a third party that (i) the operation of the
Valor Business prior to the ISR Effective Time, or (ii) the development, use,
manufacture, marketing, distribution, import or sale of Valor Products by
Holdco and its Affiliates, including the ISR Surviving Company and the US
Surviving Corporation, prior to or after the ISR Effective Time, infringes,
misappropriates or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property of any third
party, except in each case, to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is able
to demonstrate that (A) such infringement, misappropriation or violation arose
in whole or in part from modifications or additions made to such Valor
Products, including any modifications or additions to the manufacture or
actual or anticipated use thereof, by Holdco and its Affiliates, including
the US Surviving Corporation but excluding the ISR Surviving Company (to the
extent such modifications or additions were made by the Israeli Technology
Center other than at the request of Holdco or any of its Affiliates), after
the ISR Effective Time (except to the extent that

 



104  the Indemnified Party is able to demonstrate that such specific
modifications or additions, including any such specific modifications or
additions to manufacturing or use, were documented as included or
incorporated within the design of a Valor Product by Valor prior to the ISR
Effective Time or required by Holdco to be actually reduced to practice
pursuant to this Agreement), and (B) such Valor Products would not
infringe, misappropriate or violate such Intellectual Property but for such
modifications or additions (collectively, the " _Intellectual Property Claims_
");

 

(d) regardless of any disclosure on the _Valor Disclosure Schedule_ , (i) any
underwithholding of Taxes with respect to such Participating Rights Holder or
Founder in connection with the Transactions due to a misrepresentation or
action by such Participating Rights Holder or Founder ( _provided_ , _however_
, that the indemnification obligations of each Participating Rights Holder or
Founder under this _Section 11.2(d)(i)_ shall be limited to (x) Taxes of such
Participating Rights Holder or such Founder and (y) such Participating Rights
Holders or such Founders Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Shares and
Contingent Payments and in no event shall any other Participating Rights
Holder or Founder have any liability under this _Section 11.2(d)(i)_ in
respect thereof), (ii) any Taxes of or owed by Valor or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period other than any such
Taxes (A) set forth as liabilities on the face of the latest balance sheet
(rather than in any notes thereto) included in the Valor Financial Statements
delivered to HW prior to the date hereof (including, without limitation, any
payroll and social security Taxes included in the "other accounts payable"
line item therein) or (B) incurred after the date of such latest balance
sheet through the Closing Date in the ordinary course in accordance with the
past custom and practice of Valor and its Subsidiaries in an amount consistent
with amounts reflected on such latest balance sheet (including, without
limitation, any payroll and social security Taxes included in the "other
accounts payable" line item therein), and (iii) Taxes for which Valor or any
of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor thereof) is held liable under Section
1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law) by reason of such entity being included in any
consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group at any time on or before
the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Tax Claims_ ");

(e) regardless of any disclosure on the _Valor Disclosure Schedule_ , any
claims made by, through or on behalf of any Participating Rights Holder, any
Founder or other person relating to the entitlement to, or allocation of the
Merger Consideration among the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders,
including with respect to the transactions described in _Section 8.11_ (the
" _Merger Consideration Claims_ "); or

(f) any claims in respect of any portion of the OCS Amount that has not been
paid prior to the twelve (12) month anniversary of the ISR Effective Time to
the OCS pursuant to _Section 8.8(b)_, and any additional amounts required to
be paid to the OCS in connection with obtaining the OCS Settlement (any such
claims, the " _OCS Claims_ ").

The ability of Holdco to recover any Damages under this _Section 11.2_ shall
represent an express contract right to reduce the amount of the First-in-Man
Contingent Payment, the CE Mark Contingent Payment and the Net Sales
Contingent Payment, if any, in accordance with  _Section 11.4_, but subject
to the limitations in this _Article 11_ , and nothing in this _Article 11_
shall be deemed to require Holdco and its Affiliates, including the ISR
Surviving Company and the 

 



105  US Surviving Corporation, to obtain jurisdiction over any Participating
Rights Holder or Founder, or pursue any process in connection therewith beyond
that expressly required by the terms of  _Section 11.3_ or _Section 11.4_.

11.3 _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party desires to make a claim against an
Indemnifying Party (which term shall be deemed to include all Indemnifying
Parties if more than one) in connection with any third party Action for which
it may seek indemnification hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party will promptly notify the Indemnifying Party (or, if
the Indemnifying Parties are the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders, the Shareholder Representative), of such Third-Party Claim and of
its claims of indemnification with respect thereto; _provided_ , that failure
to promptly give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations under hereunder, except to the extent, if any,
that the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 11.3(e)_, the Indemnifying Party will, upon its
written confirmation of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third-Party Claim, have the right to assume the defense
of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party by written notice to the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Party has received notice of
the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
must continue to conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with reasonable
diligence thereafter in order to preserve its rights to control such defense;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnified Party may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense (but
not control such defense) of the Third-Party Claim.

(c) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), provided that the Indemnified
Partys consent shall not be required if the judgment or proposed settlement
(i) includes an unconditional release of all liability of the applicable
Indemnified Parties with respect to such Third-Party Claim, (ii) involves only
the payment of money damages that are fully covered by the Indemnifying Party
(including amounts deemed to be paid pursuant to a future set-off), and (iii)
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party or subject the Indemnified Party to criminal liability. The Indemnified
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim (including any Holdco-Handled
Claim) without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed by the
Indemnifying Party); _provided_ , that no such consent of the Indemnifying
Party shall be required for any settlement of a Third-Party Claim which
involves only a license of Intellectual Property which is permitted pursuant
to clause (i) of the proviso in _Section 1.6(f)(iii)_ or for which the
Indemnified Party no longer seeks indemnification under this _Article 11_.

 

(d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to assume or has no further
right to conduct the defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with
_Section 11.3(b)_ or is not entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party
Claim pursuant to _Section 11.3(e)_, (i) the

 



106  Indemnified Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate but shall not be entitled to consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, the Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third-Party Claim, and (ii) Holdco shall retain all remedies to which it is
entitled under this _Article 11_ (including set-off against portions of the
CE Mark Contingent Payment, the First-in-Man Contingent Payment and the Net
Sales Contingent Payment, if any, in accordance with _Section 11.4_, subject
to the limitations in this _Article 11_ ).

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim if (i) such Third-Party
Claims relates to any Intellectual Property Claims, or (ii) such Third-Party
Claim principally seeks injunctive relief, specific performance, or seeks to
impose any criminal liability on the Indemnified Party (the matters described
in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Holdco-Handled Claims_ ").
Except to the extent that any such disclosure could cause a waiver of
applicable attorney-client privilege, the Shareholder Representative shall
have the right, upon its reasonable request, to monitor the progress of
Holdco-Handled Claims, to review on a timely basis all pleadings and other
filings relating thereto and to discuss with counsel to Holdco such matters
relating to Holdco-Handled Claims as may be reasonably appropriate. Holdco
and its Affiliates shall pursue in good faith, through counsel of their
selection, the prosecution, defense or settlement of all Holdco-Handled Claims
until such time, if any, that Holdco shall elect not to pursue
indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
will remain responsible for any Damages of Holdco as a result of such Holdco-
Handled Claims to the extent subject to indemnification under this _Article
11_ , and Holdco and its Affiliates, including the ISR Surviving Company and
the US Surviving Corporation, shall retain all remedies to which they are
entitled under this _Article 11_ (including set-off against the Contingent
Payments, subject to the limitations in this _Article 11_ ).

11.4 _Payment of Claims_.

 

(a) In the event of any bona fide claim for indemnification hereunder,
including a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will provide to
the Indemnifying Party a certificate signed by any officer of the Indemnified
Party (an " _Officer s Certificate_") stating that Damages have been
incurred, or are reasonably expected to be incurred, or are claimed by a third
party to be or have been incurred with respect to the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Party set forth in _Article 11_ , specifying,
in reasonable detail and to the extent known to the Indemnified Party in each
case: (i) the amount of such Damages that have been incurred at the time of
the delivery of the Officers Certificate (or a reasonable estimate of such
Damages) and, to the extent known, the amount of Damages that are expected to
be incurred (or a reasonable estimate of such Damages), (ii) the individual
items of such Damages included in the amount so stated, (iii) the date of the
occurrence of each such item, and (iv) the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, covenant or claim to which such item is related and the
specific representation, warranty, covenant or obligation in this Agreement to
which the claim for such misrepresentation or breach relates. The Officers
Certificate shall be accompanied with a copy of all court filings with
respect to a Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of
thirty (30) days within which to respond in writing to any claim by an
Indemnified

 



107  Party on account of a Damage that does not result from a Third-Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30) day
period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in
which event the Indemnified Party will be entitled to pursue such remedies as
may be available to the Indemnified Party. In order to satisfy any
indemnification obligations of the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 11_, the Holdco Indemnitees shall recover any Damages that are
finally determined to be payable hereunder, subject to the limitations in
this  _Article 11_ , from the Escrowed Shares (to the extent not yet
released) or amounts set-off with respect to a claim for indemnification from
portions of certain Contingent Payments in accordance with this _Section
11.4_ whether or not such Contingent Payments are then required to be paid;
_provided_ that set-off with respect to Intellectual Property Claims shall
only be from the Net Sales Contingent Payment; _provided_ , _further_ that if
the OCS Claims remain outstanding as of the date of the release of the
Escrowed Shares, an amount equal to the OCS Maximum Amount shall remain in
escrow until the OCS Settlement is obtained and the OCS Claims are finally
determined. Notwithstanding any other provision herein or in the Escrow
Agreement, the Holdco Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover any
Damages for Intellectual Property Claims from amounts set-off from the Net
Sales Contingent Payment. All such recoveries from the Escrowed Shares
or set-offs against such Contingent Payments shall be made on a _pro rata_
basis from all Participating Rights Holders and all Founders in accordance
with each such Persons Pro Rata Share. For purposes of determining the value
of any Holdco Common Shares used to satisfy indemnification claims made by
Holdco Indemnitees under this Agreement, each such share shall be deemed to
have a value equal to the Reference Market Value on the date of issuance;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any Escrowed Shares used to
satisfy an indemnification claim made by the Holdco Indemnitees under this
Agreement, such share shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Reference
Market Value on the date of such indemnification claim. For the avoidance of
doubt, once the Escrowed Shares or Contingent Payments have been actually paid
to the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders, absent fraud, Holdco
shall have no right of recovery against such Escrowed Shares or Contingent
Payments or the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement (including this _Article 11_). Other than
in the case of fraud by such Person, in no event shall any
Participating Rights Holder or any Founder have any personal liability above
and beyond such Persons Pro Rata Share of the Escrowed Shares or such
Persons Pro Rata Share of portions of Contingent Payments set-off for Damages
recoverable hereunder. Any indemnification obligations of Holdco pursuant to
this _Article 11_ shall be paid to the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders as Contingent Payments, at Holdcos election either (x) in cash or
(y) in Holdco Common Shares valued at the Reference Market Value on the date
of issuance, or (z) through a combination of the methods specified in clauses
(x) and (y). The parties agree that to the greatest extent permitted by Law
the payment of any indemnity hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration and Founders Portion for Tax purposes.

(b) Subject to the limitations in _Section 11.5_, Holdco shall be entitled
to reduce certain Contingent Payments by the amount of any Damages that have
been incurred or suffered, or are reasonably likely to be incurred or
suffered, by any Holdco Indemnitee to the extent that any Holdco Indemnitee
has asserted an indemnification claim for such Damages hereunder (including
any such Damages in respect of any Third-Party Claim); _provided_ , that if
the Indemnifying Party has rejected or has deemed to have rejected such claim
hereunder and any

 



108  such Contingent Payment is otherwise due and payable pursuant to the terms
hereof, Holdco shall deposit the contested portion of such Contingent Payment
with the Escrow Agent, which the Escrow Agent shall hold in a segregated
account until such time as such claim has been finally resolved pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement and shall thereafter distribute such
Contingent Payment pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Shareholder
Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to fulfill any
indemnification obligations of the Participating Rights Holders and the
Founders to any Holdco Indemnitee hereunder by payment of cash to Holdco. In
the event that any such indemnification obligation hereunder is so fulfilled
by payment of cash, any Escrowed Shares or Contingent Payments in respect of
such indemnification obligations shall promptly be deposited by the Escrow
Agent or Holdco, as the case may be, with the Exchange Agent for further
distribution to the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders in
accordance with each such Persons Pro Rata Share. Any costs, fees and
expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in connection with
fulfilling any indemnification obligations by payment of cash, including in
respect of premiums, deductibles, retention amounts and other fees associated
with any representation and warranty or other insurance policy obtained the
Shareholder Representative, shall be deemed Shareholder Representative
Expenses hereunder.

11.5 _Limitations of Liability_.

 

(a) _Threshold_. The Participating Rights Holders and the Founders will not be
required to indemnify any Holdco Indemnitee pursuant to  _Section 11.2(a)_:
(i) unless any claim or series of related claims involves Damages in excess of
$25,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_ ") and if such Damages do not exceed the Mini-
Basket, such Damages shall not be applied to or considered for the Threshold
or otherwise for the purposes of aggregating the amount of Damages under this
_Section 11.5(a)_; and (ii) until such time as the aggregate amount of
Damages under _Section 11.2(a)_, actually paid or incurred, for which the
Holdco Indemnitees are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement exceeds $2,500,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), at which time the
Participating Rights Holders and the Founders shall only be obligated to
indemnify the Holdco Indemnitees for any Damages under _Section 11.2(a)_ in
excess of the Threshold. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 11.5_, the threshold limits imposed by this  _Section 11.5(a)_
shall not apply to any Damages arising out of or in connection with (A) any
breach by Valor of any Special Representations, (B) any Special Claims, and
(C) fraud. In addition, any Damages described in the foregoing sentence shall
not count towards the Threshold for purposes of determining whether the
threshold limits have been exceeded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in no event shall the Participating Rights Holders or the
Founders be required to indemnify any Holdco Indemnitee under _Section
11.2(a)_ for the inability to utilize any Valor Tax Attribute in a Tax period
(or portion thereof) after the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Time Limit_. All agreements, covenants and other obligations in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and the Effective Time;  _provided_ that
no Indemnifying Party will be liable for any Damages hereunder with respect to
any covenant, agreement, obligation or undertaking that is to be performed at
or prior to the Closing unless a written claim for indemnification is given
by an Indemnified Party to Holdco or the Shareholder Representative,

 



109  as applicable, with respect thereto prior to the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date. All representations and warranties of HW in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered by HW pursuant to this Agreement
shall terminate and expire as of the Effective Time, and any liability of
Holdco with respect to such representations and warranties shall thereupon
cease, other than with respect any Damages arising out of or in connection
with fraud. All representations and warranties of Valor in this Agreement or
any certificate delivered by Valor or the Shareholder Representative pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall expire on, and
no Indemnifying Party will be liable for any Damages hereunder with respect
to a breach of such representations and warranties unless a written claim for
indemnification is given by an Indemnified Party to the Shareholder
Representative with respect thereto prior to the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "); _provided_ ,
that (i) the Special Representations and the representations or warranties in
_Section 4.14_ shall survive, and indemnification claims with respect
thereto may be made, until the sixtieth (60th) day following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to any extensions or
tolling thereof required by a Governmental Authority) for the claim or matter
upon which the indemnification claim is based (which shall be the statute of
limitations applicable to a Third Party Claim, in the event of a Third
Party Claim). All other indemnification claims under _Section 11.2_,
including any Special Claims and OCS Claims, may be made until the sixtieth
(60th) day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(giving effect to any extensions or tolling thereof required by a Governmental
Authority) or the claim or matter upon which the indemnification claim is
based (which shall be the statute of limitations applicable to a Third Party
Claim, in the event of a Third Party Claim); _provided_ , _further_ , that
Intellectual Property Claims shall survive, and claims with respect thereto
may be made, until the date on which the Net Sales Contingent Payment is due.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any claims based on fraud
shall survive for the period provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if at any time prior to the applicable expiration date set forth
above any Indemnified Party delivers a written claim for indemnification to
the Indemnifying Party (or, if the Indemnifying Party is the Participating
Rights Holders, the Shareholder Representative), then the claim asserted by
such Indemnified Party shall survive until such time as such claim is fully
and finally resolved.

(c) _Maximum Liability_. The parties specifically agree that, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary:

(i) the maximum aggregate liability of the Participating Rights Holders and
the Founders under this Agreement under _Section 11.2_ shall be (w) the
Escrowed Shares, (x) ten percent (10%) of the Holdco Common Shares included in
the CE Mark Contingent Payment in the event that the CE Mark Milestone is
achieved following the Closing Date, (y) ten percent (10%) of the Holdco
Common Shares included in the First-in-Man Contingent Payment and (z) ten
percent (10%) of the Net Sales Contingent Payment that, in the case of
clauses (x), (y) and (z), becomes payable hereunder, except Damages arising
out of (A) Special Representations or Special Claims (which are subject to the
limitations in _Section 11.5(c)(iv)_), (B) Intellectual Property Claims
(which are subject to the limitations in _Section 11.5(c)(ii)_, or (C) fraud,
shall in each case not be limited to such amounts;

 



110 (ii) the ability of the Holdco Indemnitees to recover for any
Intellectual Property Claim shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of the
aggregate amount of Damages of the Holdco Indemnitees related to or arising
out of such Intellectual Property Claim, and the maximum aggregate liability
of the Participating Rights Holders and Founders for Damages arising out of
all Intellectual Property Claims (however calculated, and whether or not
assessed with respect to any sales of Valor Products) shall not exceed the
lesser of (x) an amount equal to five percent (5%) of aggregate Net Sales for
the Valor Products to which such Intellectual Property Claims relate and (y)
$50,000,000, except for Damages arising out of fraud;

 

(iii) the maximum aggregate liability of the Participating Rights Holders
(including the Obligated Valor Shareholder) and the Founders under this
Agreement under _Section 11.2(f)_ shall be the OCS Maximum Amount;

(iv) the maximum aggregate liability of the Participating Rights Holders and
the Founders under this Agreement under _Section 11.2_ (including Damages
arising out of Special Representations, Special Claims (other than
Intellectual Property Claims) and OCS Claims) shall be (w) the Escrowed
Shares, (x) ten percent (10%) of the Holdco Common Shares included in the CE
Mark Contingent Payment in the event that the CE Mark Milestone is achieved

similar provisions or agreements covering any Damages to the same extent as
it would if such Damages were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

this _Article 11_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, only the
Shareholder Representative shall have the right, power and authority to
commence any action, suit or proceeding, including any arbitration proceeding,
by and on behalf of any or all Participating Rights Holders or the Founders
against Holdco and its Affiliates, including the ISR Surviving Company and the
US Surviving Corporation, or any other Holdco Indemnitee, and in no event
shall any Participating Rights Holder or Founder himself, herself or itself
have the right to commence any action, suit or proceeding, including any
arbitration proceeding, against Holdco and its Affiliates, including the ISR
Surviving Company and the US Surviving Corporation, or any other
Holdco Indemnitee, in each case other than any such action, suit or

Consideration or the Founders Portion. Each Participating Rights Holder and
Founder waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Participating Rights

to exercise or assert), other than in connection with any such Persons
status as a DandO Indemnified Party, any right of contribution, right of
indemnity or other right or remedy against Holdco and its Affiliates,
including the ISR Surviving Company and the US Surviving Corporation, in
connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which
such Participating Rights Holder or Founder may become subject under or in

12.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable Law,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

12.3 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the documents referred
to herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be
assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise
by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be
null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



114 12.4 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, including its successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is
intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_
_however_ , that (i) the Participating Rights Holders and the Founders shall
be express third-party beneficiaries for purposes of Holdcos obligations
under _Sections 1.6_ , _1.7_ , and  _Article 3_ of this Agreement; (ii) the
Indemnified Parties shall be express third-party beneficiaries for purposes of
_Article 11_ of this Agreement; and (iii) the former officers and directors of
Valor and its Subsidiaries shall be express third-party beneficiaries for
purposes of _Section 8.18_ of this Agreement.

12.5 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
may occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed
in accordance with the terms hereof and that each party, without the necessity
of posting bond or other undertaking, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance
of the terms hereof (including the parties obligations to consummate the
Transactions (including the ISR Merger and the US Merger), and Holdcos
obligation to pay, and the right to receive the Merger Consideration by the
Participating Rights Holders and the Founders Portion by the Founders, as
applicable), in addition to any other remedy at law or equity ( _provided_ ,
for the avoidance of doubt, that the issuance of the HW Termination Note
hereunder, as applicable, shall, except as expressly provided herein in the
case of fraud, be the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for
the applicable termination contemplated thereby). In the event that any
Action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
party hereto shall allege, and each party hereto hereby waives any defense or
counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

12.6 _Release_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Transactions by the Valor Shareholders, from and after the ISR
Effective Time, each of the Participating Rights Holders (regardless of

its Securities of Valor in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the ISR Merger) and Founders shall be deemed to have agreed,
effective upon the Closing and in consideration of the Merger Consideration
and the Founders Portion, and for other good and valuable
consideration which are hereby acknowledged, each Participating Rights Holder
and Founder (on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns (the "
_Releasing Persons_ ")) hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges

assigns (collectively, the " _Released Persons_ ") from any and all claims,
actions, causes of action, debts, damages, losses, liabilities or obligations
of any kind or nature whatsoever that any of the Releasing Persons now has,
has ever had, or may hereafter have, against any Released Person, in each
case solely in respect of the Releasing Persons capacity as a holder of
Securities of Valor or Interests in Mitral, as applicable, arising from or
relating to actions, failures to act or circumstances in effect or occurring
prior to the Closing, in each case, whether absolute or contingent, asserted
or unasserted, express or implied, matured or unmatured, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, and

 



115  whether arising at equity or under any Law, agreement or understanding or
otherwise, including, without limitation, claims of fiduciary duties against
any director, officer or manager of Valor or its Subsidiaries or any holder
of Securities or Interests in Mitral and all liabilities, obligations and
claims relating to Securities of Valor or Interests in Mitral (collectively,
the " _Holder Related Claims_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event

Related Claims be deemed to include) any rights of any Releasing Persons
pursuant to (x) such Persons status as a stockholder of Holdco; (y) this
Agreement and the Related Agreements any other certificate, document or
instrument executed or delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any Related
Agreement, or (z) fraud (the Holder Related Claims, in each case,
excluding the claims described in this sentence, are referred to herein as
the " _Released Claims_ "). Each Releasing Person agrees that no Releasing
Person shall bring any claims, actions or suits against, or seek to recover
any amounts in connection with any Released Claims or under any Released
Claims from, Holdco, HW, ISR Merger Sub, US Merger Sub, the US Surviving
Corporation, the ISR Surviving Company, Valor or its Subsidiaries or any of
the other Released Persons.

 

12.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
