 9.4 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) on a timely basis (taking into account valid extensions of time to file) all Tax Returns of the Company required to be filed by the Company before the Closing Date, and the Company shall timely pay the Tax shown to be due thereon. Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and complete, shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the similar Tax Returns for the preceding taxable periods, unless otherwise required by Law, and shall not make, amend, revoke or terminate any Tax election or change any accounting practice or procedure without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Company shall give a copy of each such Tax Return to the Buyer with sufficient time for its review and comment prior to filing (taking into account the due date of the Tax Return). The Company shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments by the Buyer prior to the timely filing of such Tax Returns, provided that such comments have been delivered promptly enough to provide the Company with sufficient time to review them and make any changes prior to the timely filing of the Tax Returns. 

  

 (b) The Representative shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) at the Representatives expense all Tax Returns of the Company required to be filed by the Company on or after the Closing Date with respect to any taxable period of the Company that ended on or before the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be true, correct and complete, shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the similar Tax Returns for the preceding taxable periods, unless otherwise required by Law, and shall not make, amend, revoke or terminate any Tax election or change any accounting practice or procedure without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Representative shall give a draft of such Tax Return to Buyer with sufficient time for its review and comment at least 30 days prior to filing or such shorter period as is required to facilitate the timely filing of such Tax Return. Buyer shall provide any comments in writing, specifying with particularity any such item to which Buyer objects and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection to the Representative, as promptly as possible, but in no event later than 10 days after receiving such draft of such Tax Return or such shorter period as is required to facilitate the timely filing of such Tax Return. Buyers failure to notify the Representative of any such objection prior to the end of the applicable review period shall indicate its concurrence with such draft of such Tax Return. The Representative and Buyer shall attempt to resolve in good faith any dispute with respect to the preparation of such Tax Return prior to the due date of such Tax Return. In the event that the Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute within the applicable 

   ##### 

  

 

review period, the Representative and Buyer shall submit the matter to the
Independent Accountant to resolve the dispute in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.6(b)(iii) as promptly as possible (and the
determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be entitled to
file, or cause to be filed, the applicable Tax Return as prepared by Buyer to
avoid a late filing of such Tax Return, subject to amending such Tax Return
upon the final determination by the Independent Accountant, if necessary. The
Company shall timely file such Tax Return and pay any Tax shown thereon to be
due. The Stockholders severally and not jointly shall indemnify Buyer to the
extent required by Section 11.1. 

   

 (c) The Company shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be filed) on a timely basis (taking into account valid extensions of time to file) all Tax Returns of the Company required to be filed by the Company with respect to a Straddle Period. Any such Tax Return for a Straddle Period shall be true, correct and complete, shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the similar Tax Returns for the preceding taxable periods, unless otherwise required by Law, and shall not make, amend, revoke or terminate and tax election or change any accounting practice or procedure without the prior consent of the Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. Buyer shall give a draft of such Tax Return to the Representative with sufficient time for its review and comment at least 30 days prior to filing or such shorter period as is required to facilitate the timely filing of such Tax Return. The Representative shall provide any comments in writing, specifying with particularity any such item to which the Representative objects and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such objection to Buyer, as promptly as possible, but in no event later than 10 days after receiving such draft of such Tax Return or such shorter period as is required to facilitate the timely filing of such Tax Return. The Representatives failure to notify Buyer of any such objection prior to the end of the applicable review period shall indicate its concurrence with such draft of such Tax Return prior to the date of such Tax Return. The Representative and Buyer shall attempt to resolve in good faith any dispute with respect to the preparation of such Tax Return. In the event that the Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute within the applicable review period, the Representative and Buyer shall submit the matter to the Independent Accountant to resolve the dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.6(b)(iii) as promptly as possible (and the determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties hereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be entitled to file, or cause to be filed, the applicable Tax Return as prepared by Buyer to avoid a late filing of such Tax Return, subject to amending such Tax Return upon the final determination by the Independent Accountant, if necessary. The Company shall timely pay the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns. The Stockholders severally and not jointly shall indemnify Buyer to the extent required by Section 11.1. 

  

 (d) Buyer shall retain (or cause the Company to retain) all Books and Records with respect to Tax matters of the Company for Pre-Closing Periods for at least five (5) years following the Closing Date and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into by or with respect to the Company with any Taxing Authority. 

  

 (e) After the Closing, in connection with the preparation of Tax Returns or any Action relating to the Tax liabilities imposed on the Company, Buyer and the Company, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, 

   ##### 

  

 

including the furnishing or making available during normal business hours of
records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of
attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such
Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims
by Taxing Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. Each Stockholder shall,
within 10 days of Buyers request therefor, deliver any information related
to such Stockholder that is required to be reported by either Buyer or the
Company pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code. 

   

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Tax of the Company that is attributable to any Tax period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") will be apportioned between the period of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the period of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_ ") in accordance with this Section 9.4(f). The portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will (a) in the case of any income (net or gross), gross receipts, profits, windfall profit, sales, use, goods and services, ad valorem, value added, franchise (to the extent that such franchise tax is measured by one of the other methods listed in this clause (a)), withholding, employment, social security, workers compensation, unemployment compensation, payroll, transfer, excise (to the extent that such excise tax is imposed on a transaction), import, occupancy, recording, minimum, alternative minimum, stamp, severance, custom, duty, environmental or estimated tax, and any other Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing Date; and (b) in the case of any other Taxes be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period. The balance of the Tax for the Straddle Period shall be attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on the greater of a Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other hand, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period will be determined based on the foregoing and based on the manner in which the actual Tax liability for the entire Straddle Period is determined. In the case of a Tax that is (i) paid for the privilege of doing business during a period (a " _Privilege Period_ ") and (ii) computed based on business activity occurring during an accounting period ending prior to such Privilege Period, any reference to a "Tax period", a "tax period", or a "taxable period" means such accounting period and not such Privilege Period. The Stockholders will be severally and not jointly liable for the payment of all Taxes of the Company that are attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Pre-Closing Straddle Period whether or not shown on any original Tax Return or amended Tax Returns for the period referred to therein. 

  

 (g) After the Closing, unless otherwise required by Law and unless carrying back any tax attribute or credit generated after the Closing Date, the Company may not (and Buyer shall not cause the Company to) amend any Tax Return of the Company for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

  

 (h) Except with respect to any refund of Taxes or Tax credit arising from, or attributable to, losses, deductions, credits, expenses or other Tax items or attributes arising from, 

   ##### 

  

 

or attributable to, the operations of Buyer or the Company after the Closing
or with respect to amounts for which the Stockholders are not liable to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under the covenant in Section
11.1(a)(v), the Company shall pay to the Representative the amount of any Tax
refund received or Tax credit realized by the Company with respect to a Pre-
Closing Period, net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred by Buyer
or the Company in obtaining such Tax refund or Tax credit (reduced by any Tax
benefit from such expense) and any net Tax incurred by Buyer or the Company
as a result of such Tax refund or Tax credit, within 10 days after
such receipt of realization. With such payment, the Company shall provide the
Representative with a statement showing the computation of such amount in
reasonable detail but in no event shall the Company be required to provide
any confidential information with respect to such statement.
The Representation shall pay such amount to the Stockholders pro rata in
proportion to their respective percentages set forth on Schedule I. In the
event that any portion of any amount paid pursuant to this Section 9.4(h) to
the Representative shall subsequently be challenged successfully by
any Taxing Authority, the Stockholders severally and not jointly shall be
obligated to repay to Buyer the portion of such amount successfully
challenged, together with any interest and penalty imposed thereon, net of
any reasonable out-of-pocket expense incurred by the Stockholders or
the Representative in connection with such challenge by the Stockholders as a
result of such successful challenge. 

   

 (i) Buyer agrees to file, at the Stockholders expense, any claims for refund or amended Tax Returns for the Company with respect to a taxable period of the Company ended on or before the Closing Date as prepared by the Representative in accordance with Section 9.4(b), unless such claim for refund or amendment could reasonably be expected to adversely affect Buyer, the Company or their Affiliates with respect to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. 

  

 (j) To the extent the provisions of this Section 9.4(j) are inconsistent with the provisions of Section 11.3, the provisions of Section 9.4(j) shall control. 

   

 (i) The Representative shall have the right (but not the duty), at the Stockholders expense, to represent the interests of the Company before the relevant Authority in connection with any Action that relates solely to Taxes of the Company in one or more Pre-Closing Periods, including responding to inquiries, preparing Tax Returns, handling audits, defending Tax positions, contesting proposed assessments and resolving any Tax liability or adjustment in Taxes with respect thereto, and to control such Action on behalf of the Company with such counsel as may be selected by the Representative; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Representative may not settle or compromise any item with respect to such Action, which settlement or compromise could reasonably be expected to affect the Tax liability of the Company in a period ending after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned. Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in (but not control) such Action and employ counsel separate from the Representative, at Buyers own expense. The Representative shall keep Buyer informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Action, and will, in good faith, allow Buyer to consult with it regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such Action.

 11.3 _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all claims by either a Buyer Indemnitee or a Stockholder Indemnitee (together, " _Indemnified Party_ ") for indemnification: 

  

 (a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Representative (as agent for Stockholders) or Buyer, as applicable, prompt notice (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ") of any third-party Action with respect to which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), which shall describe in reasonable detail the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. The failure to give the Indemnification Notice shall not impair any of the rights or benefits of such Indemnified Party under Section 11.1 or 11.2, except to the extent such failure materially and adversely affects the 

    ##### 

  

    

ability of Stockholders or Buyer, as applicable (any of such parties, "
_Indemnifying Parties_ ") to defend such claim or increases the amount of
such liability. 

   

 (b) In the case of any Third-Party Claims as to which indemnification is sought by any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the sole expense and liability of the Indemnifying Parties, to exercise full control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Parties, within a reasonable time after the giving of an Indemnification Notice by the Indemnified Party (but in any event within ten (10) days thereafter), shall (i) deliver a written confirmation to such Indemnified Party that the indemnification provisions of Section 11.1 or 11.2 are applicable to such Action and the Indemnifying Parties will indemnify such Indemnified Party in respect of such Action pursuant to the terms of Section 11.1 or 11.2 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, shall do so without asserting any challenge, defense, limitation on the Indemnifying Parties liability for Losses, counterclaim or offset, (ii) notify such Indemnified Party in writing of the intention of the Indemnifying Parties to assume the defense thereof, and (iii) retain legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Parties assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b)(ii), then the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties in any manner reasonably requested in connection with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to be kept fully informed by the Indemnifying Parties and their legal counsel with respect to the status of any legal proceedings. If the Indemnifying Parties so assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Parties have agreed to pay such fees and expenses, or (ii) the named parties to any such Third-Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and an Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties in the conduct of the defense thereof and in any such case the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties. 

   

 (d) If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.3(b)(ii), the Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Parties withdraw from or fail to vigorously prosecute the defense of such asserted liability, or unless a judgment is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If the Indemnifying Parties do not elect to defend, or if, after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Parties fail to adequately prosecute or withdraw such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying Parties expense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in, and the Indemnified Party (at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties) shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnified Party, (ii) to the extent such Third Party Claim involves criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party, or (iii) if such Third 

    

55 

      

* * *

 

##### 

 

  

Party Claim would impose liability on the part of the Indemnified Party in an
amount which is greater than the amount as to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. In the event the
Indemnified Party retains control of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party will not settle the subject claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. 

   

 (e) If the Indemnified Party undertakes the defense of any such Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 and proposes to settle the same prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Parties prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to participate in the settlement, assume or reassume the defense thereof or prosecute such appeal, in each case at the Indemnifying Parties expense. The Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party settle or compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim (i) in which any relief other than the payment of money damages is or may be sought against such Indemnified Party, (ii) in which such Third Party Claim could be reasonably expected to impose or create a monetary liability on the part of the Indemnified Party (such as an increase in the Indemnified Partys income Tax) other than the monetary claim of the third party in such Third-Party Claim being paid pursuant to such settlement or judgment, (iii) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant, person conducting such investigation or initiating such hearing, plaintiff or petitioner to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim and all other Actions (known or unknown) arising or which might arise out of the same facts, or (iv) may reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the affected business of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party has the right to settle any Third-Party Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed by the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (f) In the case of any amount payable to a Buyer Indemnitee, such amount, (x) if the Indemnifiable Loss Limit applies to the Loss associated therewith, shall be satisfied, subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, solely from the Indemnity Escrow Amount, and (y) if the Indemnifiable Loss Limit does not apply to the Loss associated therewith, shall first be satisfied, subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, from the Indemnity Escrow Amount until such amount has been exhausted. 

  

 11.4 _Periodic Payments_. Any indemnification required by Section 11.1 or 11.2 for costs, disbursements or expenses of any Indemnified Party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Action shall be made by periodic payments by the Indemnifying Parties to each Indemnified Party during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or costs, disbursements or expenses are incurred. 

  

 11.5 _Right of Set Off_. In the event that Parent or Buyer is entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Article XI, Parent or Buyer shall be entitled to set off any amounts owed to Stockholders pursuant to Section 11.2 and/or against the amount of such indemnification. Any such set-off will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 11.6 _Payment of Indemnification_. In the event that Parent or Buyer is entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Article and Parent or Buyer is unable to set off such indemnification pursuant to Section 11.5 and the amount of the indemnification to which the 

   ##### 

  

 

Parent or Buyer is entitled pursuant to this Article XI is greater than the
Escrow Amount, Stockholders shall severally, in accordance with the
percentages provided on Schedule I, and not jointly pay the amount of the
indemnification in cash. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, indemnification for breaches of the representations
contained in Article IV of this Agreement may only be obtained from the
Stockholder or Stockholder who breached such representations and warranties.
Any payments pursuant to this Article XI will be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by Law. 

   

 11.7 _Insurance and Tax_. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take into account any insurance proceeds or other third party reimbursement actually received and shall be net of any reduction in Taxes paid by the Company or Buyer to the extent the claim for which indemnification is sought gives rise to a deduction, amortizable amount or credit. For purposes of determining whether the Company or Buyer has received any Tax benefit during any taxable year, any item of deduction or credit resulting from such claim for indemnification shall be treated as the last item of deduction or credit. 

  

 11.8 _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. Except for (i) the representations and warranties in 3.20 (Compliance with Laws), 5.29 (Employment Matters), 5.31 (Tax Matters) and 5.33 (Environmental Laws), which shall survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the statue of limitations with respect thereto (including any extensions and waivers thereof), and (ii) the Fundamental Representations, which shall survive indefinitely, the representations and warranties of the Company, Stockholders and Buyer shall survive until the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing. 

  

 11.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. The sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any breach or inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or warranty in this Agreement (other than in respect of fraud, for which the following limitation will not apply), or any covenant or agreement to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, shall be indemnification in accordance with this Article XI.

 12.1 _Litigation_. The parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and courts of the State of Illinois located in Cook County with respect to any claim, action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and do hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive any right to contest venue in said courts or to claim that said courts constitute an inconvenient forum. 

  

 12.2 _Waiver of Jury Trial; Exemplary Damages_. 

  

 (a) THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT EACH SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, IN ANY COURT IN WHICH AN ACTION MAY BE COMMENCED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR BY REASON OF ANY OTHER CAUSE OR DISPUTE WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT OF ANY KIND OR NATURE.

 14.2 _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies._  

  

 (a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each party (provided that the Representative may sign any such amendment on behalf of each Stockholder), or terminated orally or by course of conduct. No provision hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party against whom such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply only in the particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given. 

   

 (b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to or demand on a party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that party or impairs any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand, including any right to take any action without notice or demand not otherwise required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect to such breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to any other breach. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or that otherwise may be available. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither party shall seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary damages, under any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach (or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith (other than punitive or exemplary damages awarded in connection with a Third-Party Claim). 

   

 14.3 _Arms-Length Bargaining_. This Agreement has been negotiated at arms-length by parties of equal bargaining strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other special relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise exists. 

  

 14.4 _Publicity_. Except as required by law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Buyer or its Affiliates lists securities, the parties agree that neither they nor their agents shall issue any press release or make any other public disclosure concerning the transactions contemplated hereunder without the prior approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   ##### 

  

  

 14.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. 

  

 14.6 _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right or delegate any obligation hereunder, without the written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void, in addition to constituting a material breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Buyer may without the consent of the Representative, assign its rights under this Agreement to (a) any lender of Buyer or to any Affiliate of Buyer or (b) any purchaser of substantially all of the assets or business of the Company. 

  

 14.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. 

  

 14.8 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted signature pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures of all other parties. 

  

 14.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Additional Agreements, and the Mutual Nondisclosure and Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 16, 2010, between Parent and the Company, sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements related thereto (whether written or oral), all of which are merged herein and therein. No provision of this Agreement or any Additional Agreement may be explained or qualified by any agreement, negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct or course of conduct or by any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or any Additional Agreement, there is no condition precedent to the effectiveness of any provision hereof or thereof. No party has relied on any representation from, warranty or agreement of any person in entering into this Agreement, prior or contemporaneous or any Additional Agreement, except those expressly stated herein or therein. 

  

 14.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or cause such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid provision as is lawful. 

  

 14.11 _Construction of Certain Terms and References; Captions_. In this Agreement: 

  

 (a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules, and exhibits not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and subsections, schedules, and exhibits of this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and, unless the context requires otherwise, "party" means a party signatory hereto. 

   

 (c) The word "amended" means amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified and the word "amendment" has correlative meaning. Any use of the singular or plural, or the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender, includes the others, unless the context otherwise requires; "including" means "including without limitation;" "or" means "and/or;" "any" means "any one, more than one, or all;" and, unless otherwise specified, any financial or accounting term has the meaning of the term under GAAP. 

   

 (d) Unless otherwise specified, any reference to any agreement (including this Agreement), instrument, or other document includes all schedules, exhibits, or other attachments referred to therein, and any reference to a statute or other law includes any rule, regulation, ordinance, or the like promulgated thereunder, in each case, as amended. Any reference to a numbered schedule means the same-numbered section of the disclosure schedule. 

   

 (e) If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be given within a specified number of days following a specific date or event, the day of such date or event is not counted in determining the last day for such action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be given on or before a particular day which is not a Business Day, such action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given on or before the next Business Day. 

   

 (f) Captions are not a part of this Agreement, but are included for convenience, only. 

   

 (g) For the avoidance of any doubt, all references in this Agreement to "the knowledge of the Company", "knowingly" (when used with respect to the Company) or similar terms shall mean the actual knowledge of McNeeley, Haigh and Michael DiNanno. 

   

 (h) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

   

 14.12 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall execute and deliver such documents and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the scope of such partys obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 14.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries._ Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof confers any benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any Person not a signatory hereto, except that a Representative pursuant to Section 14.14 may enforce any right assigned to such assignee. 

  

 14.14 _Stockholders  Representative_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Each Stockholder who is a party to this Agreement hereby appoints McNeeley as such Stockholders representative to act as Representative for all purposes of this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, with the right, in such capacity, in his discretion, to do any and all things and to execute any and all documents in such Stockholders place and stead, in any way which such Stockholder could do if personally present, in connection with this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the authority on behalf of such Stockholder, without giving notice to such Stockholder, to take any of the following actions: 

    

 (i) to accept on such Stockholders behalf any amount payable to such Stockholder under this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement or the Working Capital Escrow Agreement; 

   

 (ii) to negotiate and otherwise deal with Buyer and Parent, in all respects including with respect to the working capital and any other adjustments; 

   

 (iii) to accept and give service of process and all other notices and other communications relating to this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement or the Working Capital Escrow Agreement; 

   

 (iv) to settle any dispute relating to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement or the Working Capital Escrow Agreement; 

   

 (v) to execute any instrument or document that the Representative may determine is necessary or desirable in the exercise of his authority under this Agreement and power-of-attorney; and 

   

 (vi) to act in connection with all matters relating to this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the power to employ auditors, attorneys and other Persons in connection therewith. 

  

 (b) Each Stockholder further agrees, as follows: 

    

 (i) Such Stockholder recognizes the inherent conflict of interest of McNeeley as the Representative and as a continuing employee of Buyer and party to the McNeeley Purchase Agreement and waives any claims with respect thereto; 

   

 (ii) the Representative (A) shall not incur any personal liability for acting in such capacity if in doing so he acts upon advice of counsel or otherwise acts in good faith, (B) shall not incur any personal liability for acting in such capacity in the absence of his willful misconduct, (C) may act upon any instrument or signature believed by him to be genuine and may assume that any Person purporting to give any notice or instruction under this Agreement or under any other related agreement or document believed by him to be authorized has been authorized to do so (D) shall not be responsible for the investment of any payments received from Parent for the benefit of Stockholders, and (E) shall be promptly reimbursed by Stockholders, pro rata for out-of- 

   ##### 

  

   

pocket expenses incurred by him in his capacity of Representative, and such
expenses shall first be satisfied from any Closing Payment paid by Parent and
received by the Representative for the benefit of Stockholders, prior to
distribution of such payments to Stockholders; and 

   

 (iii) If McNeeley is unable to serve or resigns as the Representative, Stockholders may appoint from among their ranks a substitute Representative to replace McNeeley, which individual shall have all the powers and authority granted to McNeeley by this Section 14.14. Buyer shall accept such substitute Representative without objection;  _provided_ , _however_ , that McNeeley shall continue to serve as the Representative until such substitute Representative has been appointed by Stockholders. 

  

 (c) At and after Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to deal exclusively with Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby involving the Stockholders who are a party hereto, or any of them, and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any statements made by the Representative or documents executed or purported to be executed on behalf of such Stockholders by the Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of such Stockholders by the Representative including the appropriate communication or delivery to such Stockholders.
