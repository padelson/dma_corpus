security, workers compensation, unemployment compensation, payroll, transfer, excise (to the extent
that such excise tax is imposed on a transaction), import, occupancy, recording, minimum,
alternative
minimum, stamp, severance, custom, duty, environmental or estimated tax, and any other Tax
based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing
Date; and (b)&nbsp;in the case of any other Taxes be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Pre-Closing Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period.
The balance of the Tax for the Straddle Period shall be attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle
Period. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on the greater of a Tax on net
income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise measured
by income, on the other hand, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period

manner in which the actual Tax liability for the entire Straddle Period is determined. In the case
