shall be converted into the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in
accordance with Section 1.4(b). Prior to the Effective Time, the board of

to each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of LBI
Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 (the " _Exchanged Shares_ "), along
with, in each case, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of HBI Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s)) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such
form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange
Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions for
use in surrendering Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
applicable Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of HBI
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends
or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Shares, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of
Exchanged Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time
but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after such surrender, the
applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
HBI Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of
the Exchanged Shares represented by its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall
represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of HBI Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 



Page 6 of 50 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to HBI Common Stock shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
with respect to the shares of HBI Common Stock represented thereby, in each
case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of HBI Common Stock
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and paid prior to such
surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of HBI Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with a record date
after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment
date subsequent to the issuance of the HBI Common Stock issuable with respect
to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares representing Exchanged Shares that are not registered in the stock
transfer records of LBI, the shares of HBI Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of HBI Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration
shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such
Exchanged Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any
transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of HBI that the tax has
been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the
expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, HBI or the
Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of HBI Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Exchanged Shares such amounts as the Exchange
Agent, HBI or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the
amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, HBI or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Exchanged
Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of LBI of the shares of LBI Common Stock other than to settle
transfers of such LBI Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of HBI Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Article II.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of HBI Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or distribution
with respect to HBI Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of HBI. In lieu
of the issuance of any such fractional share, HBI shall pay to each former
shareholder of LBI who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional
share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the HBI

 



Page 7 of 50  Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of LBI Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective
Time and rounded to the nearest ten thousandth when expressed in decimal
form) of HBI Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of LBI as of the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time
will be transferred to HBI. In such event, any former shareholders of LBI who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to HBI with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on HBI Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each Exchangeable Share such shareholder holds
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of HBI, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of LBI Common Stock for any amount delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws.

 

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by HBI or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as HBI may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Article II, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

(including by increasing staffing levels and external hires).

 

(e) Each of Purchaser and Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the Contemplated

reports pertaining to Company Real Property not previously made available to

be required to provide access to or to disclose information to the extent
such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
such party or its Subsidiaries (after giving due consideration to the
existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between
the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of

arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(b) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to this

will include in the Joint Proxy Statement the LBI Board Recommendation and use
all commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the

obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders for a vote. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _LBI Shareholder Approval_ " shall mean the
affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by
holders of outstanding LBI Common Stock.

shareholders that they approve the issuance of HBI Common Stock in connection

of all the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding HBI Common
Stock.

(c) If on the date of the LBI Shareholder Meeting, LBI has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of LBI Common Stock to
obtain the LBI Shareholder Approval, LBI shall adjourn the LBI Shareholder
Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by LBI and HBI,
which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days
after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall continue to use all commercially reasonable best efforts,
together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of proxies
from shareholders relating to the LBI Shareholder Approval. LBI shall only be
required to adjourn or postpone the LBI Shareholder Meeting one time pursuant
to this Section 6.3(c).

(d) If on the date of the HBI Shareholder Meeting, HBI has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of HBI Common
Stock to obtain the HBI Shareholder Approval, HBI shall adjourn the HBI
Shareholder Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by LBI
and HBI, which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten

6.4 _NASDAQ Listing_. HBI shall cause the shares of HBI Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to have been authorized for listing on the NASDAQ Stock
Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
employee who is actively employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date (each a " _Continuing Employee_ ") while employed by Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time with employee benefits
which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than employee benefits
provided by Purchaser to similarly situated employees of Purchaser; _provided_
, _however_ , that until such time as Purchaser shall cause Continuing
Employees to participate in the benefit plans of Purchaser, a Continuing
Employees continued participation in the Employee Benefit Plans shall be
deemed to satisfy the foregoing provision of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in Purchaser benefit plans may commence
at different times with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan). Accordingly,
Company shall cooperate with Purchaser to ensure that from the Closing Date
through the next open enrollment date for Purchasers group health, dental,
vision and life insurance plans, the Continuing Employees shall continue to
be covered by Companys group health, dental, vision and life insurance plans;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Company shall terminate, effective as of the
Effective Time, its plans and programs with respect to long term care and
health savings accounts.

 



Page 36 of 50 (b) Upon Continuing Employees enrollment in Purchasers employee benefit
plans, such Continuing Employees will, consistent with the provisions of
Section 6.5(a) above, become participants in all Purchasers employee benefit
plans, practices, and policies on the same terms and conditions as similarly
situated employees of Purchaser. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior service credit for each of Continuing Employees service with
Company, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, shall be given by
Purchaser with respect to all Purchasers retirement plans, employee benefit
plans, practices, and policies, including, but not limited to, vacations, sick
leave and personal time, to the extent that such crediting of service does not
result in duplication of benefits, but not for accrual of benefits under any
defined benefit. If any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in
any Purchaser employee benefit plan, practice, or policy that provides
medical, hospitalization or dental benefits, Purchaser shall (A) cause any
pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
Purchaser benefit plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under the Employee Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(B) recognize any health expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if
later, the year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to
participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such Purchaser benefit plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of
applicable law, Purchaser shall assume the employment and change in control
arrangements of Continuing Employees who were employed with Company or its
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement and who continue such employment
through the Effective Time; _provided_ , that any changes that were made to
such employment or change in control arrangements after July 1, 2013, shall
have been discussed with and approved by Purchaser prior to their
effectiveness.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, Companys board of directors (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary to terminate Companys 401(k) plan (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and to ensure that the account balances of the
participants in the Company 401(k) Plan are fully vested upon such
plan termination, in each case effective as of the day prior to the Closing
Date. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following
receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of
the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the
participants, and Purchaser shall take the action necessary (including the
amendment of Purchasers 401(k) Plan (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ")) to
permit the Continuing Employees to roll over any eligible rollover
distributions (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including
of loans) in cash or notes (in the case of loans) in an amount equal to the
full account balance distributed to such Continuing Employee from the Company
401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan. Each Continuing Employee shall be
eligible immediately as of the Effective Time to participate in the Purchaser
401(k) Plan.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this
Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee, independent contractor or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Employee Benefit Plan,
Purchaser Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Purchaser, Company or any of their respective
affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan,
Purchaser Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or
(iii) confer upon any current or former employee, independent contractor or
other service provider any right to employment or continued employment or
continued service with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries),
or constitute or create an employment or other agreement with any employee,
independent contractor or other service provider.

 



Page 37 of 50 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of HBI and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the Contemplated Transactions, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law; and HBI and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance such
indemnified expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. 

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, HBI will provide directors and officers liability insurance
that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time)
(providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the
existing policies also include Side B coverage for Company) with respect to
claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events
occurring before the Effective Time (including the
Contemplated Transactions), which insurance will contain at least the same
coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to
the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by Company;
_provided_ that in no event shall HBI be required to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of 150% of the aggregate annual premiums or
renewals paid as of the date hereof by Company for any such insurance (the "
_Premium Cap_ "); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if any such annual expense
at any time would exceed the Premium Cap, then HBI will cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. Prior to the Effective Time and in
lieu of the foregoing, Company will use commercially reasonable best efforts
to purchase a tail policy for directors and officers liability insurance on
the terms described in the prior sentence and fully pay for such policy prior
to the Effective Time.

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.6(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify HBI in writing; _provided_ that failure
to so notify will not affect the obligations of HBI under Section 6.6(a)
unless and to the extent that HBI is actually and materially prejudiced as a
consequence.

(d) If HBI or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to
any other entity, then and in each case, HBI will cause proper provision to
be made so that the successors and assigns of HBI will assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.6.

6.7 _Exemption from Liability Under Rule 16(b)-3_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Purchaser and Company shall each take all such steps as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of LBI Common Stock or
conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of LBI
Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



Page 38 of 50 6.8 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Company shall immediately cease, and Company shall cause each of its
representatives to immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal. After the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company and its
directors, executive officers and Subsidiaries shall not, and Company
shall cause each of its and its Subsidiaries representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry with
respect to, or the making of, any proposal that constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate
in any negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal with, or furnish any
nonpublic information relating to an Acquisition Proposal to, any Person that
has made or, to the Knowledge of Company, has indicated without solicitation
that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) engage in
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal with any Person that has made,
or, to the Knowledge of Company, without solicitation is considering making,
an Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such Person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 6.8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
after the date hereof but before approval of this Agreement by LBIs
shareholders, (1) Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that LBIs board of directors believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such
Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a violation of this Section 6.8,
(3) LBIs board of directors determines in good faith (after receiving advice
from outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (4) LBIs board of directors determines
in good faith (after receiving advice from outside counsel) that the failure
to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) below would be reasonably
likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Company may
(and may authorize its representatives to) (x) furnish nonpublic information
regarding Company to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement containing
terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Company than, those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement with Purchaser, and (y) participate
in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) The board of directors of LBI shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify, change or qualify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify, change or qualify), in a manner adverse in any respect to the
interests of Purchaser, its recommendation referred to in Section 6.3, or (ii)
approve or recommend (or publicly propose to approve or recommend or announce
its intention to approve, recommend or propose) any Acquisition Proposal
(either (i) or (ii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Company shall
not, and the board of directors of LBI shall not allow Company to, and
Company shall not allow any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other agreement relating to any Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before obtaining approval
of the Merger by LBIs shareholders, LBIs board of directors may, if LBIs
board of directors determines in good faith (after receiving advice from
outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Purchaser
under this Section 6.8(b), make an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_
that Company may not make any Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Acquisition Proposal unless (x) Company shall not have breached this Section
6.8 in any respect and (y):

(i) LBIs board of directors determines in good faith (after receiving advice
from outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has been made and
has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking
into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by Purchaser under this Section 6.8(b);

 



Page 39 of 50 (ii) Company has given Purchaser at least four (4) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and has
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal; and

(iii) Before effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, Company has
negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Purchaser during such notice period to the extent Purchaser wishes to
negotiate, to enable Purchaser to revise the terms of this Agreement to give
Purchaser the opportunity to match or exceed the terms of the Acquisition
Proposal such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal.

In the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior Proposal,
Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Purchaser a new
written notice, the notice period shall have recommenced and Company shall be
required to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.8 with respect to
such new written notice.

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Company under Section 6.8(a) and Section
6.8(b), Company shall notify Purchaser promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Company
or any Subsidiary by any Person that informs LBIs board of directors or any
Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice to Purchaser shall be made orally and in writing, and
shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or
intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting
nonpublic information or access to the books and records of Company or any
Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. Company shall keep
Purchaser fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the
status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Company shall also promptly, and
in any event within 24 hours, notify Purchaser, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal
in accordance with Section 6.8(a).

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company from informing
any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.8.

For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer other than this Agreement or any amendment hereto after the
date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Transaction or any public
announcement by any Person (which shall include any regulatory application or
notice) of a proposal, plan or intention with respect to any Acquisition
Transaction.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ " means any of
the following (other than the transactions contemplated hereby) involving
Company: (a) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination
or other similar transaction; (b) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of assets that constitute a substantial portion
of the assets of Company in a single transaction or series of transactions; or
(c) any tender offer or exchange offer for 20% or more of the outstanding
shares of its capital stock or the filing of a registration statement under
the Securities Act, in connection therewith.

 



Page 40 of 50 For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in
or incorporated into the definition of such term changed from 20% to 50%) that
LBIs board of directors determines in good faith (after receiving advice from
outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person (or
group of Persons) making the proposal (including the Company Termination Fee
and conditions to consummation), (A) if consummated, would be more favorable
to the shareholders of LBI from a financial point of view than the
Contemplated Transactions (including taking into account any adjustment to the
terms and conditions proposed by Purchaser in response to such proposal under
Section 6.8 or otherwise) and (B) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis.

6.9 _Takeover Laws_. No party will take any action that would cause the
Contemplated Transactions to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those transactions
from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Takeover Laws_ " means any "moratorium," "control share,"
"fair price," "interested stockholder" or other anti-takeover laws and
regulations of any jurisdiction.

 

6.10 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
15 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date hereof,
Company will furnish to Purchaser, and Purchaser will furnish to Company, (a)
consolidated financial statements (including balance sheets, statements
of operations and stockholders equity) of it or any of its Subsidiaries (to
the extent available) as of and for such month then ended, (b) internal
management reports showing actual financial performance against plan, and (c)
to the extent permitted by applicable law, any reports provided to its board
of directors or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance
and risk management of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company and Purchaser will give prompt
notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (a)
is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts,
events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect
with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein
that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII.

 

6.12 _Company Trust Preferred Securities_. Company will cooperate with
Purchaser with respect to effecting the redemption of Companys trust
preferred securities of Liberty (AR) Statutory Trust I, Liberty (AR) Statutory
Trust II, Russellville Statutory Trust I, and the Small Business Lending Fund

owned subsidiary of HBI. Promptly after incorporating Sub, (x) HBI, as the
sole shareholder of Sub, shall approve and adopt this Agreement, and (y) HBI
shall cause Sub to accede to this Agreement by executing a signature page to
this Agreement, after which time Sub shall be a party hereto for all purposes
set forth herein. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the
obligations of Sub to perform its covenants under this Agreement
shall commence only at the time of its incorporation. Prior to the Effective
Time, HBI shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause the
board of directors of Sub to unanimously approve this Agreement and declare it
advisable for Sub to enter into this Agreement.

proportionate adjustment in the event that outstanding shares of HBI Common
Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that if Company
elects to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) and provides such written
notice to Purchaser, then within two (2) business days following Purchasers
receipt of such notice, Purchaser may elect by written notice to Company to
adjust the Merger Consideration by increasing the Total Cash Consideration. If
Purchaser makes such election to increase the Total Cash Consideration, no
termination will occur pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) and this Agreement will
remain in effect according to its terms (except as the Total Cash
Consideration has been increased).

forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Company, Purchaser, any
of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of
them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this Agreement,

Agreement, and (ii) neither Company nor Purchaser shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its knowing breach of
any provision of this Agreement (which, in the case of Company, shall include
the loss to Companys shareholders of the economic benefits of the Merger).

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General Fees._ Except for the registration fee for the Form S-4 filing
and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger, which shall be
paid by Purchaser, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the

expenses of printing and mailing the Joint Proxy Statement) shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

(b) _Company Termination Fee_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of LBI or HBI; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
any approval of the Contemplated Transactions by such shareholders, there may
not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this
Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of the parties.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

9.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles,
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." References to "the date hereof" shall mean
the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the phrase " _to the

Page 46 of 50  or words of similar import means what is known or should have been known
based on reasonable inquiry by any of Companys officers listed on _Section
9.4_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the phrase " _to the Knowledge
of Purchaser_ " or works of similar import means what is known or should have
been known based on reasonable inquiry by any of Purchasers officers listed
on _Section 9.4_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule. All schedules and
exhibits hereto shall be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any
reference to this Agreement. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state
regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and
restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any
reason such court or regulatory agency determines that any provision, covenant
or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it is the express intention
of the parties that such provision, covenant or restriction be enforced to
the maximum extent permitted.

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same
counterpart.

9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement.

9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arkansas, without giving
effect to its principles of conflicts of laws. The parties hereto agree that
any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in
any federal or state court located in the State of Arkansas. Each of the
parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of
jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such
action or proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy that may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or
relating to, this Agreement, or the Contemplated Transactions. Each party
certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver, (b) each party understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver, (c) each party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each party has
been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual
waivers and certifications in this Section 9.8.

9.9 _Publicity_. Neither Company nor Purchaser shall, and neither Company nor
Purchaser shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect
to, or otherwise make any public statement, or, except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic
information to a third party, concerning, the Contemplated Transactions
without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably

 



Page 47 of 50  withheld or delayed) of Purchaser, in the case of a proposed announcement,
statement or disclosure by Company, or Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement, statement or disclosure by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that either party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by law or by the rules and
regulations of the SEC or NASDAQ.

9.10 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned
by either of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall
be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by each of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for
Section 6.6, which is intended to benefit each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives, (1) Purchaser and Sub, on the one hand, and
Company, on the other hand, hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and (2) this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended to and does not
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
under this Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein.

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are
entitled at law or equity.

 

9.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement, Company
delivered to Purchaser a schedule (a " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") and
Purchaser delivered to Company a schedule (" _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_
"), each of which sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in Article III or Article IV,
respectively, or to one or more covenants contained herein;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a
representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the
related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and (ii)
the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had
or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
