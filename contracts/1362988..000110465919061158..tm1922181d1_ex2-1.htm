The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the receipt of the affirmative votes of a
majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding Common Shares at the Company Shareholders Meeting (the &#8220;<U>Company Shareholder
Approval</U>&#8221;). The Board of Directors of the Company (the &#8220;<U>Company Board</U>&#8221;) has adopted resolutions, by
vote of the directors present at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of the Company was present, (i) determining
that the Merger Consideration constitutes fair value for each Common Share in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act; (ii) determining
that the terms of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby are fair and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders; (iii) approving and declaring advisable the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the Merger; and (iv)&nbsp;subject to <U>Section 5.04</U>, convening a meeting of the shareholders and recommending
that the Company&#8217;s shareholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, at a duly held meeting of such shareholders for such
purpose (the &#8220;<U>Company Shareholders Meeting</U>&#8221;). Except for any Adverse Recommendation Change made after the date
of this Agreement that is expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn.
Except for the Company Shareholder Approval, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or its Affiliates are necessary
to authorize or adopt this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement (except for executing and delivering the Statutory Merger Agreement
and the filing of the Merger Application with the Registrar pursuant to the Bermuda Companies Act). The Company has duly executed
and delivered this Agreement, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except, in each case,
as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or similar Laws affecting
creditors&#8217; rights generally and by general principles of equity.</P>
