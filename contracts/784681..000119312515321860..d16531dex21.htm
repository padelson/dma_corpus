Corporations_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and

251(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_
") as more particularly set forth herein; and

be  satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in writing in accordance with this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_" shall

_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed, acknowledged and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Certificate
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of

until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws.

 

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that

thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws.

 

ARTICLE III

_Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and

and the Bylaws.

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the

-2- ARTICLE IV

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock Exchange of Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Cablevision NY Group Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (a " _Class A Share_ ", or
collectively " _Class A Shares_ ") and each share of Cablevision NY Group
Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (a " _Class B
Share_ ", or collectively " _Class B Shares_ ", and together with the Class A
Shares, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by the Company, Parent or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries, in each case not held on behalf
of third parties in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) Shares that are owned by
stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall
be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive cash in the amount of $34.90 per Share without interest (the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any
of the Shares and each non-certificated Share represented by book entry (a "
_Book-Entry Share_") (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of such Excluded Share, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under Section
4.2(f).

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
CompanyÂ’s prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent
agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying

 



-3-  Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company.
The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Financial
Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankerÂ’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$10 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash
payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange
Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other
than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary
form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon
delivery of an "agentÂ’s message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-
Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), and with respect to Certificates, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter
of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Book-Entry Shares or Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent.

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal and with such other
customary documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash
amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (A) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) _multiplied by_ (B) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates.

 



-4- (iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a). In lieu thereof,
each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agentÂ’s message" in
customary form (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares
shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of such "agentÂ’s message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares represented by such Book-
Entry Share _multiplied by_ (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-
Entry Shares. 

(iv) _Special Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying
Agent and The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") designed to provide that
(A) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the
Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (B) if the Closing
occurs after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st) business day after the
Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC
Payment.

 

(v) _Unrecorded Transfers_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for
any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued
to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash
amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate
is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

 



-5- (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that
remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one hundred and
eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who
has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section (e) or Book-Entry Shares, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary
affidavit, in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required
by Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the number
of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
_multiplied by_ the Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
PersonÂ’s right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Laws that are received by the Company relating to stockholdersÂ’
rights of appraisal. Except to the extent otherwise permitted pursuant to
Section 6.1(a), the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
withdrawn, failed to perfect or has otherwise lost the right to appraisal with
respect to any Shares, such Shares shall cease to be Excluded Shares and such
Shares shall be treated and paid out as if converted pursuant to Section
4.1(a).

 



-6- (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, Company Equity Awards or Company Cash Performance Awards such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section
5.1(n)(iii)) Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be.

 

4.3. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Cash Performance Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the CompanyÂ’s 2015 Employee

Non-Employee Directors, Amended and Restated Employee Stock Plan and Amended
and Restated Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (collectively, the " _Stock
Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive (without interest),
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event
no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y)
the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per Share of such Company Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Option that has an exercise price per Share that is
greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, any vesting
conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted stock award (a "
_Company Restricted Share_ ") under the Stock Plans, shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in
full, and any performance conditions applicable to such Company Restricted
Share shall be deemed achieved as provided in the applicable award agreement,
and such Company Restricted Share shall be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Company Restricted Share to receive (without interest), as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in cash
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required
to be withheld with respect to such payment.

 



-7- (c) _Treatment of Company Performance RSUs_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding performance restricted stock unit (a " _Company Performance
RSU_ ") under the Stock Plans, shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, become immediately vested at
the target level of performance as provided in the applicable award
agreements, and such Company Performance RSU shall, automatically and without
any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Company Performance RSU to receive (without
interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event no later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an
amount in cash equal to (A) the number of Shares subject to such Company
Performance RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (after application of
the foregoing vesting provisions) _multiplied by_ (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to any Company Performance
RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time
without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Stock Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code.

(d) _Treatment of Company Director RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding restricted stock unit (a " _Company Director RSU_ ") under the
2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Amended and Restated Stock
Plan for Non-Employee Directors shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Company Director RSU to receive (without interest), as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no
later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in
cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such Company Director RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to any Company
Director RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the
Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the
applicable Stock Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(e)  _Treatment of Company Cash Performance Awards_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding cash performance award (a " _Company Cash Performance Award_
") granted under the CompanyÂ’s Cash Incentive Plan and Management Performance
Incentive Program shall, automatically and without any required action on the
part of the holder thereof, become immediately vested at the target level of
performance, as provided in the applicable award agreements, and such
Company Cash Performance Award shall be paid to the holder thereof in an

in the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering
into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") ( _it_ _being_
_agreed_ that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement (except as otherwise expressly provided
in this Article V) that:

 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws (as defined in Section 5.1(i)) of its respective
jurisdiction of organization if the concept of good standing is recognized in
such jurisdiction and has all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in
each jurisdiction that recognizes the concept of good standing and the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).

 

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power

(financial or otherwise), business, assets or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (2) the CompanyÂ’s ability
to consummate the Merger and the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
none of the following, and no change, event, circumstance or effect,
individually or in the aggregate arising out of, resulting from or
attributable to any of the following, shall constitute or be taken into
account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would
reasonably be expected to occur:

 

(A) any changes in general United States or global economic conditions, except
in the event that any change, event, circumstance or effect to or on a
business or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising from any
such changes in conditions has a materially disproportionate effect on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the effect that
such changes in conditions have on a comparable business or businesses of
other companies in the cable, telecommunications or media industries (in which
case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into
account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or
would reasonably be expected to occur);

(B) any changes in conditions generally affecting the cable,
telecommunications or media industries, except in the event that any change,
event, circumstance or effect to or on a business or businesses of the Company
and its Subsidiaries arising from any such changes in conditions has a
materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse effect that such
changes in conditions have on a comparable business or businesses of
other companies in the cable, telecommunications or media industries (in
which case only the incremental disproportionate adverse impact may be taken
into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or
would reasonably be expected to occur);

(C) any change in the market price, trading volume or credit rating of any of
the CompanyÂ’s securities (other than of the Class B Shares) ( _provided_ that
the exception in this clause (C) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that any change, effect, or development underlying such change
has resulted in or contributed to a Material Adverse Effect);

(D) any regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities,
credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the
United States or any foreign jurisdiction;

(E) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company or its Subsidiaries to meet
any internal or publicly available projections, forecasts, estimates or
predictions ( _provided_ that the exception in this clause (E) shall not
prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any change, effect, or
development underlying such failure has resulted in or contributed to a
Material Adverse Effect);

 



-10- (F) the public announcement or pendency of this Agreement, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such other
transactions, including the Financing, the " _Transactions_ ") or the identity
of Parent or any of its Affiliates, including the effect thereof on
the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of the Company or any of its
Affiliates with employees, franchisors, labor unions, contractors,
subscribers, suppliers, partners and other third parties ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ that this clause (F) shall not apply to Section 5.1(d));

(G) any actions or omissions of the Company or its Subsidiaries taken (or not

application or enforcement thereof, except, as it relates to clause (ii), in
the event that any change, event, circumstance or effect to or on a business
or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising from any such
changes has a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse effect that
such changes have on a comparable business or businesses of other companies
in the cable, telecommunications or media industries operating in the
jurisdictions affected by the change (in which case only the incremental
disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected
to occur);

 

(J) any geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities,
any acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or military actions, or any escalation
or worsening of any such hostilities, acts of war, sabotage, terrorism or
military actions threatened or underway, or epidemics, pandemics, earthquakes,
hurricanes, tornadoes or other natural disasters or calamities, except in the
event that any change, event, occurrence or effect to or on a business or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising from any such changes
in conditions has a materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to the adverse effect that
such changes in conditions, events or other natural disasters or calamities
have on a comparable business or businesses of other companies in the cable,
telecommunications or media industries (in which case only the incremental
disproportionate adverse impact may be taken into account in determining
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected
to occur); or

 



-11- (K) any liability to the extent accrued or reserved against in the
consolidated financial statements included in the Company Reports (or the
notes thereto) filed or furnished prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 1,400,000,000 Class A Shares, of which 222,603,582 Shares were outstanding

were outstanding as of the close of business on September 15, 2015, and

close of business on September 15, 2015. Other than 25,011,970 Shares reserved
for issuance under the Stock Plans, the Company has no Shares reserved for
issuance. Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct
and complete list of all outstanding Company Equity Awards as of September 15,
2015, setting forth the number of Shares subject to each Company Equity Award
and, if applicable, the exercise price with respect to each Company Equity
Award. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of
each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge,
pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ ").
Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities
or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock
Plan, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. The Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on
any matter. Other than pursuant to applicable Law and as contemplated by this
Agreement, there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries restricting the transfer or voting of any Shares.

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the
Transactions, subject only, assuming the accuracy of the representation and
warranty in Section 5.2(g), to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
issued and outstanding Class A Shares and Class B Shares, voting together as a
single class and representing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast
on such matter (the " _Requisite Stockholder Approval_ "). This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company

 



-12-  and, assuming due execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’
rights and to general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").

(ii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company Board has (A) determined
that this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions are fair to and are in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (B) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger and the Transactions and (C)
subject to Section 6.2, resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares
adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and directed that this
Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption.
The Company Board has received the opinions of each of its financial
advisors, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, PJT Partners LP
and Guggenheim Securities, LLC, to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion, and based upon and subject to the facts, assumptions, limitations
and qualifications set forth therein, the Per Share Merger Consideration is
fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares (other than the
Company, Parent, or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries).
Assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty made in Section
5.2(g), the Company Board has taken all action so that Parent will not be
an "interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating
a "business combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used
in Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger in the manner contemplated hereby.

(iii) The only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement is the Requisite Stockholder
Approval.

_Governmental Entity_ ") in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation of the

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions will not,

"multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") (each, a "

including ERISA and the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Plan_
" means any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
practice, agreement, contract, arrangement or other obligation, whether or
not in writing and whether or not funded, in each case, which is sponsored or

of Section 3(3) of ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal
Revenue Service to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred that would adversely affect

reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or
4976 of the Code, except for any such penalty or Tax as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

_ERISA Affiliate_ "). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
maintained, established, participated in or contributed to, or is or has been
obligated to contribute to, or has otherwise incurred any obligation or
liability (including any contingent liability) under, a Multiemployer Plan in

-17- (v) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or
other approval of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or the
Transactions could, either alone or in combination with another event, (1)
entitle any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or any material increase in severance pay (other than severance pay
required by any Laws) or (2) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
materially increase the amount of compensation due to any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is a party covering any employee, former employee, officer,
director, shareholder or contract worker of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, would (either alone or in
combination with other events) give rise to the payment of any amount,
including by way of accelerated vesting, that, as of the date of this
Agreement, is not expected to be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code as a result of or in connection with the entering into, or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement. Neither the

negotiation to become party to, any collective bargaining agreement. There is
no material strike, lockout, slowdown, work stoppage, unfair labor practice or
other labor dispute, or material arbitration or grievance pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting labor,
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages

and the Transactions.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the Transactions will not, constitute or result in a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of Parent or Merger Sub. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by

 



-29-  Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the
Transactions will not, constitute or result in, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws to which Parent or any of its

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no civil, criminal or
administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations
or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in
writing against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin, or would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or otherwise
interfering with, the Merger or any of the Transactions, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the Transactions.

(ii) The term "knowledge" when used in this Agreement with respect to
Parent shall mean the actual knowledge of the executive officers listed in
Schedule 5.2(d)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, and the knowledge of any
such Person obtained or that would have been obtained from a reasonable
inquiry of such PersonÂ’s direct reports.

(e) _Financing_.

 

(i) Parent has delivered to the Company (i) a true, complete and correct copy
of an executed definitive debt commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment
Letter_ ") and (ii) a true, complete and correct copy of an executed
definitive equity commitment letter (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") (the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case until
replaced by definitive agreements, as contemplated by Section 6.11, and any
agreements relating to the alternative financing, along with any related
documents, entered into in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
together the " _Financing Agreements_ ") with the financial institutions named
therein (the " _Financing Sources_ "). As of the date of this Agreement,
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Financing Sources have committed
to provide the debt financing described in the Debt Commitment Letter and
related documents (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and the equity commitment (the "
_Equity Commitment_ ") described in the Equity Commitment Letter and related
documents (the " _Equity Financing_ " and together with the Debt Financing,
the " _Financing_ ") in connection with the Merger and the Transactions. The
Financing Agreements have not been amended, modified or

 



-30-  supplemented prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of
this Agreement, no such amendment, modification or supplement is contemplated
by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect.

 

(ii) Except for fee letters (complete copies of which have been provided to
the Company, with only fee amounts and other customary threshold amounts
redacted; _provided_ that Parent represents and warrants that the redacted
provisions in such fee letters do not permit the imposition of any new
conditions (or the expansion of any existing conditions) with respect to the
availability of the Financing or any reduction in the amount of the Financing)
and engagement letters and syndication letters with respect to the Financing
and customary agency fee letters with respect to the Debt Financing and any
interest rate, currency or other cost caps relating to the Financing, as of
the date hereof there are no side letters or Contracts to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party related to the funding or consummation of the Financing.

 

(iii) Parent has paid all commitment and underwriting fees or other fees that
are due and payable in connection with the Financing Agreements, and the
Financing Agreements are (or will be when executed) in full force and effect
and are (or will be when executed) the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be and to the extent
applicable, and, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, each of the other
parties thereto, in each case subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

(iv) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
obligations of the Financing Sources, Parent and Merger Sub under the
Financing Agreements, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Agreements delivered by Parent to the Company on or prior to the date hereof
and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, other than as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Other than disclosure requirements under applicable
Law, there are no restrictions under applicable Law on ParentÂ’s ability to
issue and consummate the Equity Financing contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter, except that Parent may not issue its ordinary share A
securities for less than the Â€0.01 par value of such shares and except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Equity Financing and otherwise comply with their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

 

(v) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, any other party thereto under any of the
Financing Agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Agreements will not be satisfied.

 



-31- (vi) The aggregate proceeds of the Financing, together with cash or
cash equivalents held by Parent, as of the Effective Time, will be sufficient
to enable Parent to pay all amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger
Sub in cash in connection with the Merger and the Transactions, including,
without duplication, in respect of the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Agreement, the Company Equity
Awards and the Company Cash Performance Awards pursuant to Section 4.3 of this

order to consummate the Merger and the Transaction and any fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger and the Transactions, including any hedging costs
of Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates.

(f) _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists solely of 1000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned by Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent as of the date hereof and as of the
Effective Time Parent will own at least a majority of Merger SubÂ’s issued and
outstanding capital stock.1 Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to
the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will
have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and
the Transactions.

"affiliates" or "associates" is, and at no time during the last three years

their respective Affiliates "owns" any shares of capital stock of the Company,
as such quoted term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or beneficially
owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, or is the record holder of, or is a party to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or
disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company, except
for any such shares that may be owned by any employee benefit or other plan
administered by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the
extent the determination to acquire such shares was not directed by Parent or
Merger Sub.

 

(h) _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
budgets, projections, forecasts, business plans, cost-related plans and other
prospect information or forward-looking statements regarding the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, budgets, projections,

 



-32-  forecasts, business plans, cost-related plans and other prospect information
or forward-looking statements, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar,
that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, budgets,
projections, forecasts, business plans, cost-related plans and other prospect
information or forward-looking statements so furnished to them, and that
neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates will have
any claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors,
agents or representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto.
Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements, business plans or cost-related plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements, business plans or cost-
related plans).

(i) _Brokers and Finders_. Except for J.P. Morgan Limited, there is no
investment banker, broker or finder that has been retained by or is authorized

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.2(a) to the contrary, prior to the
time, but not after, the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a
Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2 if the Company receives from
the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party in the aggregate
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section
6.5) (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not include
a standstill or prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal)
and promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) thereafter discloses
(and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the
extent not previously provided to such party; (B) engage or participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after having
complied with Section 6.2(d), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare
advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x)
prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the
Company Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such action,
in light of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be
inconsistent with the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, (y)
in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company Board or
any committee thereof has determined in good faith based on the information
then available and after consultation with its financial advisor that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below
in Section 6.2(c)) or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal.

 

(c) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition by any Person resulting in, or proposal
or offer, which if consummated would result in, any Person becoming the
beneficial

 



-38-  owner of directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions,
25% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of
the Company, or 25% or more of the consolidated total assets (including
equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than
the Merger and the Transactions and excluding any transactions by or among
existing affiliated stockholders of the Company executed pursuant to
arrangements in effect as of the date of this Agreement or for trust and
estate planning purposes).

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more
than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company
that the Company Board or any committee thereof has determined in its good
faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its
terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result
in a transaction more favorable to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or

 

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 6.2(b), prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board or any committee thereof
may (x) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal or may approve, recommend or otherwise
declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this
Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.2 that the Company Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith is a Superior Proposal (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ") or (y) take action to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.3(a) to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal made after the date
of this Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.2, if in the case of
clauses (x) and (y) the Company Board or any committee thereof determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Laws, and, prior to making a Change of Recommendation in connection
with a Superior Proposal or taking action to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company gives Parent written notice
of its intent to take such action four (4) business days in advance of taking
such action, such notice to comply in form, substance and delivery with the
provisions of Section 6.2(f) and Section 9.6 of this Agreement. After giving
such notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation in
connection with a

 



-39-  Superior Proposal or taking action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
(to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms
of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or take action to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal. At the
end of such four (4) business day period, the Company may effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or take action to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if
the Company Board, after taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered by
Parent in response to the notice, has determined in good faith that the
Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if
the changes offered by Parent in writing were to be given effect. Any material
modification to the terms of any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a
new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of Section 6.2(c) and Section
6.2(f), except that the advance written notice obligation set forth in this
Section 6.2(c) shall be reduced to three (3) business days.

 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof from complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Laws
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be
permitted to recommend that the Company stockholders tender any Shares in
connection with any tender or exchange offer for the Shares of the Company (or
otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal), unless
in each case, in connection therewith, the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) effects a Change of Recommendation consistent with and subject to its
obligations set forth in Section 6.2(d); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
that if any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) does not reaffirm the Company

-41-  stockholders for the purpose of adopting this Agreement (the " _Stockholders
Meeting_ ") and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite
Stockholder Approval. The Company agrees, as to itself and its respective
Subsidiaries, that the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, if

Statement or the Proxy Statement, if applicable, will, at the date of mailing
to stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

comments of the SEC with respect to the Information Statement or the Proxy
Statement, if applicable, and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or

Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective

cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the Merger and the Transactions as soon as practicable, including preparing

divestiture, license, disposition or holding separate of, or any termination,
prohibition, limitation, restriction or other action with respect to existing

Merger and the Transactions. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any
of its Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to

other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

agreement by Parent of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect

operations, or interests therein, of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to
orders of, the relevant Governmental Entity giving effect thereto) if such
action would be reasonably necessary or advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate
or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (A) commencement of any
proceeding in any forum or (B) issuance of any order, decree,
decision, determination, judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin
or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the Transactions by any
Governmental Entity; and

 

(iv) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order,

consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



-44- Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any regulatory approvals required in connection with the

Parent and its Affiliates shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions that
are customarily undertaken to obtain CFIUS Approval and Team Telecom Consent
so as to enable the Closing to occur, including providing all such assurances
as may be customarily necessary to address national security (including
entering into a mitigation agreement, letter of assurance, national
security agreement, or other similar arrangement or agreement), law
enforcement, and public safety interests in relation to any services offered
by the Company or facilities owned by the Company, provided however,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Parent,
the Company nor their Affiliates shall be required as a condition to obtaining
CFIUS Approval to agree to terms and conditions that prevent Parent from
exercising effective management and control over any material portion of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(f) _News12_. The parties agree as follows:

Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating
data and other information as Parent may reasonably request, provided that the
Company shall not be required to permit any inspection, or disclose any
document or information, that would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, (A) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third
parties or violate the terms of any confidentiality provisions in any
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts (without payment of any
consideration, fees or expenses) to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure (or entered into after the date of
this Agreement in compliance with Section 6.1),

 



-45-  (B) result in a violation of applicable Laws, including any fiduciary duty,
(C) waive the protection of any attorney-client privilege or (D) result in

Company and Parent shall cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements
to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing
impediments, including through the use of redaction, clean team arrangements
or other appropriate solutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
representatives will be permitted to collect or analyze any environmental

Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

6.6.  _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause

under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

6.7. _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company
with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any
of their respective controlled Affiliates or members of their respective
boards of directors) shall issue any other press release or make any other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or the
Transactions without prior consultation with the other parties, except as may
be required by applicable Laws or by any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall consult in good faith with the
other party before making any such public announcements to the
extent reasonably practicable; _provided_ that the Company will not consult

(or such shorter period of employment as the case may be) shall be provided

salary or base wage provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the 

 



-46-  Effective Time, (2) target annual cash and long-term incentive compensation

Continuing Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use reasonable
best efforts to: (1) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its
Affiliates to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their

Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and
eligibility to participate under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if
such service had been performed with Parent, except for benefit accrual
under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes of qualifying for
subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits or the funding thereof.

 

(c) The Company shall be permitted to pay 2015 annual bonuses and the Company

based on actual performance as determined by the Compensation Committee in

Company Plans set forth on Section 6.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (1) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Company Plan, (2) prevent Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of
their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Plan in
accordance their terms, (3) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the employment

-47- 6.10. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
hereby agrees, to do the following:

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Altice US Holding I S.a.r.l and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless (including by
advancement of expenses as incurred) the present and former officers and
directors of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ "), in each case,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified PersonÂ’s services
as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services
performed by such Indemnified Person at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including in connection with the
Merger and the Transactions and actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Person. In the event
the Surviving Corporation is unable to or does not in a timely manner satisfy
its obligations under the Section this 6.10(a), Altice US Holding I S.a.r.l
shall satisfy such obligations, and only such obligations. Parent shall not
have any liability under this Section 6.10(a) for any matter or amount for
which the Surviving Corporation would be prohibited under Delaware Law from
indemnifying any Indemnified Person.

(b) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect
provisions in the CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws that are
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (or in such documents of any
successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination
of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and
employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the
intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the
date of this Agreement.

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event
not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is
available for such amount (the 

 



-48-  maximum amount of the aggregate annual premium over such six (6) year term,
the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In lieu of the foregoing, at or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may obtain, at its election, prepaid policies,
which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an
aggregate period of at least six years with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in
connection with the adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger and
the Transactions; _provided_ , that the Company shall not spend in excess of
the Maximum Premium payable hereunder to obtain all such prepaid policies. If
such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder subject to the
Maximum Premium.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.10 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Laws or any other applicable Laws or under any agreement of
any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified
in Section 6.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. These rights shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

6.11. _Financing_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing Date and the
date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, employees and advisors to use their reasonable best
efforts, to provide such reasonable and customary cooperation and information

this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, it shall not, and it shall
cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, take any action

Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Agreement, the
Company Equity Awards and the Company Cash Performance Awards pursuant to
Section 4.3 of this Agreement, repayment of any outstanding indebtedness
required to be repaid in order to consummate the Merger and the Transaction
and any fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the Transactions.

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, maintain the effectiveness

contemplated by the Financing Agreements (including complying with any request
to exercise so-called "flex" provisions and using reasonable best efforts to
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Financing
Agreements) in such amount which, when taken together with ParentÂ’s and Merger
SubÂ’s cash on hand, would be no less than the amount that would be required to
be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in cash in connection with the Merger and the
Transactions, including, without duplication, in respect of the aggregate Per

value of ParentÂ’s common shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not amend,
modify or in any way diminish such obligation, whether by amendment,
additional agreement or otherwise, until such time as Parent has completed
the Equity Financing. In the event that Parent is unable to complete the Debt
Financing or the Equity Financing in accordance with this Section 6.11, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain and consummate alternative
financing in an amount that is sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the
Merger as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than
the Termination Date (and, failing to do so, the Company may forthwith
terminate this Agreement to the extent provided in Article VIII).

 



-52- (g) To the extent reasonably requested by the Company from time to time,
Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing. Parent and
Merger Sub shall not (without the prior written consent of the Company)
consent or agree to any amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of
the Financing Agreements (including cancellation of commitments thereunder
except as contemplated in any Financing Agreement upon a funding into escrow)
if such amendment, supplement, modification or replacement could reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and
the Transactions; provided that, it is understood and agreed that Parent may
amend the Financing Agreements to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, managers or other Financing Sources that have not executed the
Financing Agreements and amend titles, allocations and the fee arrangements
with respect to the existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
agents, managers or Financing Sources if any such amendment could not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger and the Transactions.

 

(h) Promptly following any amendment, supplement or modification of any
Financing Agreement made in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement
or the entry to any Contract or other documentation evidencing the financing
contemplated by any Financing Agreement, Parent shall provide a copy thereof
(redacted if necessary where appropriate and customary) to the Company and

thereto.

(i) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.11 (but subject to
the Company complying in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 6.11), in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required (1) to amend
or waive any of the terms or conditions of the Financing Agreements or pay
any fees in excess of or not contemplated thereunder or (2) to consummate the
Closing any earlier than the time set forth in Section 1.2. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining
of the Financing (or any other financing) is not a condition to Closing.

full Equity Commitment to be funded in accordance with the terms of the

placement agreements, including any lock-up agreements, certificates and
opinions, and comply with all covenants, agreements and undertakings set forth

-53- (iii) to cause all relevant directors and officers, and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause all relevant accountants and attorneys, to deliver the
letters, opinions, agreements and other documentation provided for in the
Equity Commitment Letter and any Equity Commitment Documentation, including
any lock-up agreements from directors and officers;

(iv) prepare, file and deliver all offering documentation called for by the
Equity Commitment Letter, including each of the offering documents set forth
in the Equity Commitment Letter and in any Equity Commitment Documentation;

 

(v) file all applications and other documentation to list any securities

as required by any Equity Commitment Documentation take all steps necessary to
prevent the withdrawal of any admission to listing or the suspension of

securities issued in a securities offering on any applicable securities
exchange;

(vi) pay all fees required to be paid under the Equity Commitment Letter and
any Equity Commitment Documentation;

place and to enter into and keep in place the all documentation contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, including any Financing Agreements;

 

(viii) facilitate the completion of any required due diligence by the
Financing Sources in connection with each Securities Offering;

(ix) not provide notice of or cause to occur, any termination of the Equity
Commitment Letter or release of the Equity Commitments under the Equity
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Company, other than
a termination or release incident to completion of the financings generating
proceeds equal to the full Equity Commitment as contemplated therein; and

(x) comply with all terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and any Equity
Commitment Documentation.

(k) At any time that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have obtained any of
the Financing, Parent shall not comingle such funds with any other assets of
Parent or its Subsidiaries and shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, such
funds in a segregated account to be drawn only to pay all amounts required to
be paid by Parent or Merger Sub in cash in connection with the Merger and the
Transactions, including, without duplication, in respect of the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Agreement, the
Company Equity Awards and the Company Cash Performance Awards pursuant to
Section 4.3 of this Agreement, repayment of any outstanding indebtedness
required to be repaid in order to consummate the Merger and the Transaction
and any fees and expenses required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or

harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,

investment bankers and other Representatives from and against any and all
losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and the performance of their respective obligations under Section
6.11 (including any action taken in accordance with Section 6.11) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than to the extent
arising from the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or bad faith of
such indemnified Person). If this Agreement is terminated or the Closing does
not occur, other than as a result of a breach by Company of its covenants and
agreements in Section 6.11, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with Section 6.11 (including those of its accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents, investment bankers and other Representatives).

at any meeting of stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub, respectively, at

days after termination by Parent, in the case of a Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(iii), (iii) promptly, but in no event later than
two business days after notice from Parent to the Company that the Termination
Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.5(iv) and (iv) on the earlier of the
execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummation of, any
transaction contemplated by the relevant Acquisition Proposal, as applicable,
in the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(i) or
Section 8.5(b)(ii) .

(c) Parent Termination Fee.

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.3(c), then Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of
$560,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") in accordance with this
Section 8.5(c);

 

(ii) In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. Payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be made
by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by
the Company promptly, but in no event later than two (2) business days after
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(c). 

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the Merger
and the Transactions, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company or Parent (as the case may be) fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, for the applicable fee set forth in this Section 8.5 or any portion
of such fee, the party that failed to pay such fee shall pay to the other
party its costs and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate
as published in _The Wall Street_ _Journal_ in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Termination Fee, or, the Parent
Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company or Parent,
respectively, pursuant to this Section 8.5, the Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s, or the
CompanyÂ’s, as the case may be, sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages
under this Agreement and upon payment of such amounts in full, no such party,
its Affiliates and their respective past or present directors, managers,
officers, agents, employees, members, partners, successors and assigns shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , no such
payment shall relieve any party to this Agreement of any liability or damages
to the other party hereto resulting from any knowing and intentional breach of
this Agreement.

 



-62- ARTICLE IX

 

 _Miscellaneous and General_

 

9.1. _Survival_. This Article IX and the agreements of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub contained in Article IV and Sections 6.8 ( _Employee Benefits_ ),
6.9 ( _Expenses_ ) and 6.10 ( _Director and Officer Liability_ ) shall survive
the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions. This Article IX and the
agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 6.9 (
_Expenses_ ), Section 6.11 ( _Financing_ ), Section 6.12 ( _Indemnification
Relating to Financing_ ) and Section 8.5 ( _Effect of Termination and
Abandonment_ ) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement. All other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the consummation
of the Merger and the Transactions or the termination of this Agreement.

9.2. _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable
Laws, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify
or amend this Agreement, solely by a written agreement executed and delivered
by duly authorized officers of the respective parties.

 

9.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the partiesÂ’
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws _provided_ , _however_ , that any such waiver shall only be
effective if made in writing. The failure of any party to assert any of its
rights hereunder or under applicable Laws shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no single or
partial exercise by any party of any of its rights hereunder precludes any
other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights hereunder or
under applicable Laws.

9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement.

 

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.
(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO
ANOTHER JURISDICTION. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such
Court of Chancery shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal courts
of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware, solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of (and any
claim or cause of action arising under or relating to) this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the Merger and
the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in
any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or
of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action,
suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or
that the venue thereof

 



-63-  may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not
be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree
that all claims relating to such action, proceeding or transactions shall be
heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(a) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (and, more specifically, that
immediate and irreparable harm would likewise occur if the Merger or any of
the Transactions were not consummated and the CompanyÂ’s stockholders did not
receive the aggregate consideration payable to them in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement). It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, if said Court of Chancery shall lack subject matter jurisdiction,
any Federal court of the United States of America located in the County of New
Castle, Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall
allege, and each party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there
is an adequate remedy at law. Each party further agrees that no other party
or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this Section 9.5(b), and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

 



-64- (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including Section 9.5(b)), the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that, in
the event of a Debt Financing Failure or an Equity Financing Failure, the
Company shall not have the right to specific performance or other equitable
remedies to enforce ParentÂ’s and Merger SubÂ’s obligation to consummate the
Closing.

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any Exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all
other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both
written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT NOR MERGER SUB NOR THE
COMPANY MAKES OR RELIES ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR
INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS, NOTWITHSTANDING
THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERÂ’S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY
DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF
THE FOREGOING. No party shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not contained
herein.

 

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as provided in Section 6.10 (
_Director and Officer Liability_ ) or Section 9.15 ( _Financing Sources_ )
and (ii) for the right of holders of Shares as of the Effective Time, after
the Effective Time, to receive the aggregate consideration payable pursuant to
Article IV of this Agreement, which rights set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
of this Section 9.8 are hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and
Merger Sub, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties further agree that the rights of
third party beneficiaries under Section 6.10 shall not arise unless and until
the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



-66- 9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent when due.

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12.  _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid
or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to a Section of, Annex to or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation."

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



-67- (c) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
in a section of such Disclosure Letter that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter to
this Agreement, as the case may be, shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

 

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary to
be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all
references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with
respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the
Company under this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Agreement is void.

9.15. _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, except for claims by Parent or the Merger Sub against the
Financing Sources pursuant to the Financing Agreements, (A) none of the
parties hereto nor any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
stockholders shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source, in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or in respect of any, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing Agreements or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (B) no Financing Source shall have any liability (whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise) to any party hereto or any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing Agreements or the performance thereof or
the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. The Financing Sources are intended third party
beneficiaries of this Section 9.15 and Sections 9.5(a) and 9.5(b).

the General Corporation Law, or by any successor thereto, indemnify any and
all persons whom it shall have power to indemnify under said section from and
against any and all of the expenses, liabilities or other matters referred to
in or covered by said section. Such right to indemnification shall

legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit
plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in official
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or alleged action in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, to
the maximum extent authorized by the General Corporation Law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,

broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneyÂ’s fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with such proceeding such indemnification shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and

expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition

it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article or otherwise.

(4) The right to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any
person by this Article shall not limit the Corporation from providing any
other indemnification permitted by law nor shall it be deemed exclusive of any
other right which any such person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, by-law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

(5) The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the General Corporation Law.

ARTICLE VII

 

By-Laws

 

The directors of the Corporation shall have the power to adopt, amend or
repeal by-laws.
