representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound
hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

ACQUISITION OF IBI BY IBG

Section 1.01. _Merger of IBI with and into IBG_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, IBI will merge with and into IBG pursuant
to the provisions of Chapter 10 and Chapter 21 of the Texas Business
Organizations Code (the " _TBOC_ ").

 

Section 1.02. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 10.008 of the TBOC. After the Merger, IBG shall continue
as the corporation resulting from the Merger (the " _Resulting Corporation_
"), and the separate corporate existence of IBI shall cease. The name of the
Resulting Corporation shall be "Independent Bank Group, Inc." The existing
principal office and facilities of IBG immediately preceding the Merger shall
be the principal office and facilities of the Resulting Corporation after the
Merger. At the Effective Time, all rights, title and interests to all assets,
including without limitation real and personal property of any type and choses
in action, owned by each of IBG and IBI shall be allocated to and vested in
the Resulting Corporation without reversion or impairment, without further
act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but
subject to any existing liens or encumbrances thereon. At the Effective Time,
all liabilities and obligations of IBG and IBI shall be allocated to the
Resulting Corporation, and the Resulting Corporation shall be the primary
obligor therefor, and no other party to the Merger shall be liable therefor.
At the Effective Time, a proceeding pending by or against either IBG or IBI
may be continued as if the Merger did not occur, or the Resulting Corporation
may be substituted in the proceedings.

 

Section 1.03. _Certificate of Formation and Bylaws_. As a result of the
Merger, the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws, each as amended, of IBG
shall continue in effect as the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the
Resulting Corporation until the same shall be amended and changed as provided
by applicable law.

 



2 Section 1.04. _Directors and Executive Officers_. The directors and
executive officers of IBG as of the Effective Time, shall be the directors and
executive officers of the Resulting Corporation, and such directors and
executive officers shall hold office from the Effective Time until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the
manner provided in the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the Resulting
Corporation or as otherwise provided by applicable law.

 

Section 1.05. _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time by virtue of
this Agreement and without any further action on the part of any holder, all
of the IBI Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive (i) an aggregate of $31,600,000 in cash,
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.05(E) (the " _Aggregate Cash
Consideration_ "), net of the Aggregate Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment
(as defined in Section 1.06(C)(1) below), and (ii) an aggregate 2,072,131 IBG
Shares (together with the Aggregate Cash Consideration, the " _Aggregate
Merger Consideration_ ").

 

A. Any IBI Shares that are owned by IBI (other than as a fiduciary) shall
automatically be canceled and retired and all rights with respect thereto
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

B. Each IBI Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time (excluding IBI Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.05(A)) shall be
converted into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive
the following consideration.

 

1. A cash amount equal to the quotient of (i) the Shareholder Cash Consideration, divided by (ii) the number of IBI Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Shareholder Cash Consideration_ " shall mean the difference between (i) the Aggregate Cash Consideration, less (ii) the Aggregate Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment. 

 

2. A fraction of an IBG Share, rounded to the nearest hundred thousandth, equal to the quotient of (i) 2,072,131 divided by (ii) the number of IBI Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ "). 

 

3. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, IBG will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional IBG Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional shares, IBG shall pay to each former holder of IBI Shares otherwise entitled to receive such fractional share an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the Closing Price, by (ii) the fraction of an IBG Share which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 1.05(B). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Closing Price_ " shall mean the closing sales price per IBG Share on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Global Select Market System (" _NASDAQ_ ") on the Calculation Date (as defined in Section 1.05(D) below), as reported by Bloomberg. 

 



3 C. Subject only to dissenters rights under Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of
the TBOC at the Effective Time, all IBI Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be cancelled and retired and all rights with respect thereto shall
cease to exist, and each holder of IBI Shares (a " _IBI Shareholder_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration provided for in this Section 1.05. Certificates previously
representing IBI Shares will be exchanged for such consideration upon the
surrender of such certificates in accordance with Section 2.04, without
interest thereon.

D. If the Tangible Equity (as defined below) on the fifth business day
preceding the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.01) (the " _Calculation
Date_ ") is greater than $84,000,000, then, on the Closing Date, IBI may
distribute to its shareholders an amount equal to the difference between (i)
the actual amount of Tangible Equity as of the Calculation Date, _less_ (iii)
$84,000,000. Any such distribution is referred to as the " _Section_ __ _
1.05(D) Distribution_." 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tangible Equity_ " means the tangible
shareholders equity of IBI as determined from IBIs financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently applied. The following items shall have been paid or properly
accrued for, on an after tax basis, in the calculation of Tangible Equity:

1. All professional fees incurred by IBI and Integrity Bank in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and similar costs and expenses; 

 

2. Costs and fees associated with the termination and de-conversion of material contracts of IBI and Integrity Bank, including their respective data processing and other IT contracts as well as the costs and fees described in _Confidential Schedule 1.05(D)(2)_ ; 

3. All payments made or owed to directors, officers and employees of IBI and Integrity Bank related to the consummation of the Merger, including without limitation bonuses, change in control payments, payments due under employment contracts or arrangements, unfunded payments due under deferred compensation arrangements, director long term care insurance payments, "stay" or "retention bonuses" paid by IBI or Integrity Bank, or similar compensation payments; 

 

4. The premium for DandO insurance tail coverage contemplated under Section 5.21; 

 

5. The portion of the payroll and income tax owed by IBI or Integrity Bank, if any, resulting from (i) any payment contemplated by Section 1.05(D)(3) above, and (ii) the payment of the Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment, if any, in connection with the cancellation of unexercised Options as provided for in Section 1.06(C); and 

6. The provision expense, if any, incurred by Integrity Bank necessary to comply with Section 5.06. 

 



4 Unrealized gains and losses on IBIs investment securities shall be excluded
from the calculation of Tangible Equity.

IBI shall, at least three business days before the Closing Date, provide IBG
with a calculation of Tangible Equity as of the Calculation Date. If IBG
disagrees with such calculation of Tangible Equity, IBI and IBG shall meet to
resolve any such disagreement. If IBI and IBG cannot resolve any such
disagreement, then an independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by IBG
and IBI shall resolve any such disagreement which resolution shall be final
and binding upon IBI and IBG. _Confidential Schedule 1.05(D)_ sets forth the
method of calculation and, by way of example only, a preliminary estimate of
Tangible Equity.

E. If the Tangible Equity on the Calculation Date is less than $84,000,000,
then the Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to
the difference between (i) $84,000,000, _less_ (ii) the Tangible Equity on the
Calculation Date.

 

Section 1.06. _Treatment of Options_. As represented by IBI in Section
3.03, IBI has granted options to purchase IBI Shares (the "Options"). A list
of the Options which are unexercised and outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement is set forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.03(C)._ The Options shall
be subject to the following treatment:

A. Upon approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the shareholders of
IBI, each Option that is not vested and exercisable shall become fully vested
and exercisable.

B. Each holder of an Option (an "Option Holder") may exercise his or her
outstanding vested Options prior to the Calculation Date pursuant to the terms
and procedures set forth in the Integrity Bank SSB 2007 Stock Option Plan and
related Stock Option Agreement. The IBI Shares issued upon the exercise of
Options shall be converted into the right to receive the consideration set
forth in Section 1.05 upon consummation of the Merger.

 

C. If an Option Holder does not exercise his or her Options prior to the
Calculation Date (a "Non-Exercising Option Holder"), any such Non-Exercising
Option Holder shall be entitled to receive, for each share of IBI common stock
underlying their unexercised and outstanding Option (an " _Option Share_ "),
an amount equal to the difference between (i) the Per Share Transaction Value,
_minus_ (ii) the applicable exercise price per Option Share as set forth on
_Confidential Schedule 3.03(C)_ (the " _Per Option Share Price_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement:

" _Per Share Transaction Value_ " shall mean the quotient of (i) the sum of
(x) the Aggregate Cash Consideration, _plus_ (y) the Stock Consideration
Value, _plus_ (z) the aggregate exercise price to be paid to exercise all of
the unexercised Options outstanding on the Calculation Date; _divided_ _by_
(ii) the Diluted IBI Shares.

" _Stock Consideration Value_ " shall mean the product of (i) 2,072,131,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Closing Price.

" _Diluted IBI Shares_ " shall mean the sum of (i) the number of IBI Shares
issued and outstanding on the Calculation Date, _plus_ (ii) the number of
Option Shares outstanding and unexercised on the Calculation Date.

 



5 1. Within five (5) business days following the Closing Date, IBG shall pay to each Non-Exercising Option Holder an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Per Option Share Price, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of Option Shares held by such Non-Exercising Option Holder (the "Non-Exercising _Option Holder Payment_ "). The aggregate Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment paid to all of the Non-Exercising Option Holders is referred to as the " _Aggregate  Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment_." 

2. A Non-Exercising Option Holders right to receive the Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment is subject to their execution and delivery to IBG of an Option Cancellation Agreement in the form of Exhibit A on or before the Calculation Date. 

3. To the extent that any unexercised and outstanding Option has an exercise price per share that is greater than the Option Share Price, any such Option shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration. 

 

4. The Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment shall be subject to applicable payroll, federal, state, and local income tax withholding and, as a result, the amount of the Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment shall be reduced by the applicable total tax withholding, and IBG shall deliver such withheld amount to the applicable taxing authority. 

Section 1.07. _Treatment of IBG Shares_. Each IBG Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on and after the Effective
Time, remain issued and outstanding as one share of common stock of IBG as the
corporation surviving the Merger.

 

Section 1.08. _Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, IBI Shares that are held by shareholders of IBI
who have complied with the terms and provisions of Subchapter H of Chapter 10
of the TBOC (each a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") shall be entitled to those
rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC; but
if a shareholder of IBI fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any
such right or remedy granted by the Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC,
each IBI Share held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the consideration as specified in Section 1.05.

 

Section 1.09. _SEC Filing and Shareholder Approval._

 

A. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, IBG
shall prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form
(the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be filed by IBG with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") in connection with the issuance of the IBG
Shares to the IBI Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.05 (including the Proxy
Statement for the shareholder meeting of IBI and prospectus and other proxy
solicitation materials constituting a part thereof (together, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") and all related documents). IBI shall prepare and
furnish to IBG such information relating to IBI and its directors, officers
and shareholders as may be reasonably required to comply with SEC rules and
regulations in connection with the Registration Statement. IBG shall provide
IBI, and its legal,

 



6  financial and accounting advisors, the right to review and provide comments
upon (i) the Registration Statement in advance of such Registration Statement
being filed with the SEC and (ii) on all amendments and supplements to the
Registration Statement and all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments relating to the Registration Statement
before filing or submission to the SEC. IBG shall consider in good faith all
comments from IBI and its legal, financial and accounting advisors to the
Registration Statement, all amendments and supplements thereto and all
responses to requests for additional information. IBI agrees to
cooperate with IBG and IBGs counsel and accountants in requesting and
obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial
advisor and independent auditor and in taking such other actions in connection
with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. If IBI has
cooperated and promptly provided information required to be delivered by it
for inclusion in the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement as required by
this Section 1.09(A) and Section 5.02, IBG shall file, or cause to be filed,
the Registration Statement with the SEC on or before January 31, 2018. IBG
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the filing thereof. IBG also agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits
and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

B. The Board of Directors of IBI (the " _IBI Board_ ") shall duly call,
give notice of, and cause to be held, a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_IBI Meeting_ ") and will direct that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby be submitted to a vote at the IBI Meeting. Specifically,
the IBI Board will present for the consideration of IBI shareholders a
proposal to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The IBI Board will (i) cause proper notice
of the IBI Meeting to be given to the IBI shareholders in compliance with
applicable law and regulations, (ii) distribute to the IBI shareholders the
Proxy Statement, (iii) recommend by the affirmative vote of the IBI Board a
vote in favor of approval of the proposals set forth in this Section 1.09(B),
subject to Section 1.09(C), and (iv) perform such other acts as may reasonably
necessary to ensure that shareholder approval of the proposals set forth in
this Section 1.09(B) are obtained. IBI shall print and commence the mailing
(at its expense) of the Proxy Statement to its shareholders on or before the
fifth business day after the date that the Registration Statement is declared
effective and a final prospectus (relating to the Registration Statement) and
Proxy Statement is on file with the SEC before such mailing.

 

C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IBI and the IBI Board are permitted to
change its recommendation as contemplated by this Section 1.09(C) (" _Change
in Recommendation_ ") if and only to the extent that:

 

1. IBI, the IBI Subsidiaries and the IBI Representatives (as defined in Section 5.10), have complied in all material respects with Section 5.10; 

2. the IBI Board, after consultation with its outside counsel, has determined in good faith that failure to make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and 

 



7 3. if the IBI Board intends to make a Change in Recommendation after IBI has received an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.10(D)), (a) the IBI Board has concluded in good faith, after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by IBG pursuant to subclause (c) below, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.10(E)), (b) IBI shall notify IBG, at least five business days in advance, of its intention to make a Change in Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal) and furnish to IBG a written description of the material terms of the Superior Proposal and copies of such other material documents that IBI is not required to keep confidential, and (c) before making such a Change in Recommendation, IBI shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period after IBIs delivery of the notice referred to in subclause (b) above, negotiate with IBG in good faith for a period of up to five business days (to the extent IBG desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

Section 1.10. _Effective Time_. The " _Effective Time_ " means the
effective time of the Merger as specified in the Certificate of Merger filed
with and certified by the Texas Secretary of State (" _TSOS_ "). The
Certificate of Merger shall be filed with the TSOS on the Closing Date.

Section 1.11. _Bank Merger_. Contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement, Integrity Bank and Independent Bank have entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger providing for the Bank Merger (the " _Bank Merger
Agreement_ "). Immediately after the Effective Time, IBG shall cause the Bank
Merger to be consummated.

Section 1.12. _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the IBG Shares are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a share
dividend thereon is declared with a record date within said period, the number
of IBG Shares to be issued as consideration pursuant to Section 1.05 shall be
adjusted accordingly to provide to the IBI Shareholders the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action; but an
offering or sale of IBG Shares shall not be deemed a reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
readjustment of the IBG Shares.

Section 1.13. _Tax Matters._ __

 

A. None of IBG, Independent Bank, IBI or Integrity Bank has taken or agreed
to take any action, or is aware of any fact or circumstance, that would
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of §

Section 2.04. _Exchange Procedures._ __

 

A. On the business day before the Closing Date, IBG shall deposit or cause
to be deposited in trust with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the " _Exchange Agent_
") the Shareholder Cash Consideration and the IBG Shares in book entry form
which the holders of IBI Shares are entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.05.

 

B. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, with the intent to be
within five business days after the Effective Time, IBG shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
record holder of an outstanding certificate or

 



12  certificates representing IBI Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), a form letter
of transmittal which will specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and contain instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. The form and
substance of the letter of transmittal and any associated cover letter shall
be mutually acceptable to IBG and IBI before such transmittal materials are
mailed to the holders of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal properly
completed and duly executed (the " _Transmittal Materials_ "), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the Per
Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration, each,
_multiplied by_ the number of IBI Shares represented by the Certificate (the "
_Surrendered Shares_ "), and (ii) an amount of cash as payment in lieu of the
issuance of fractional IBG Shares calculated in accordance with Section
1.05(B)(3), and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. The
consideration to be received by an IBI Shareholder upon surrender of his
Certificate(s) is referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_." Until
surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.04, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing IBI Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders) shall
represent for all purposes the right to receive the Merger Consideration
without any interest thereon. Promptly after receipt of the Transmittal
Materials, IBG will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange
Agent to review the Transmittal Materials in order to verify proper completion
and execution thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time and
the surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with properly
completed and executed Transmittal Materials, IBG will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to promptly deliver the Merger
Consideration.

C. After the Effective Time, the share transfer ledger of IBI shall
be closed and there shall be no transfers on the share transfer books of IBI
of the IBI Shares which were outstanding immediately before such time of
filing. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to IBG, they
shall be promptly presented to the Exchange Agent and exchanged as provided
in this Section 2.04.

D. Former shareholders of IBI shall be entitled to vote after the
Effective Time at any meeting of IBGs shareholders the number of IBG Shares
into which their IBI Shares are converted, regardless of whether such
shareholders of IBI have surrendered their Certificates in exchange therefor.

E. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to IBG Shares and payable to the holders thereof shall be paid
to the holder of a Certificate until such holder surrenders such Certificate
to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.04. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.04, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which had become payable after the
Effective Time with respect to the IBG Shares represented by
such Certificate.

F. Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of IBI for six months after the Exchange Agent mails the letter
of transmittal pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be delivered to IBG upon
demand, and any shareholders of IBI who have not theretofore

 



13  complied with the exchange procedures in this Section 2.04 shall look to IBG
only, and not the Exchange Agent, for the payment of the Merger Consideration
in respect of such shares. If outstanding Certificates for IBI Shares are not
surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed before the date on which
such IBG Shares or cash would otherwise escheat to any governmental unit or
agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property or any other applicable law, become the property of IBG (and to the
extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such property. 

G. If any IBG Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form (reasonably satisfactory to IBG) for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate representing IBG Shares in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or not payable.

 

H. None of IBG, IBI, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of IBI Shares for any IBG Share (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

I. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by IBG or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as IBG or the Exchange
Agent may direct (not to exceed the amount of Merger Consideration relating
to the relevant missing Certificate) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against IBG, Independent Bank, or IBI with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations and policies of any Government
Authority (as defined in Section 11.10), except where the failure, whether

expected to cause a Material Adverse Change to IBI or any IBI Subsidiary.

 

Section 3.07. _Financial Statements; Call Reports._

 

A. IBI has made available to IBG true and complete copies of (i) the
audited consolidated financial statement of IBI as of and for the years ended

material respects with applicable accounting requirements, have been prepared
in all material respects according to generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the periods and
at the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto),
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial condition
of IBI and the

 



17  IBI Subsidiaries at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and
the accounting records underlying the Financial Statements accurately and

of Condition and Income as of December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, December

position of Integrity Bank and the results of its operations at the date and
for the period indicated in that Call Report in conformity with the then-
applicable instructions to the Reports of Condition and Income as promulgated
by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (the " _Call Report
Instructions_ "). The Call Reports do not contain any items of special or
nonrecurring income or any other income not earned in the ordinary course of
business except as disclosed on IBIs consolidating income statement which has
previously been made available to IBG.

accordance with regulatory accounting principles (" _RAP_ ") as applied to
banking institutions and in accordance with all applicable rules and
regulations. To IBIs Best Knowledge, the allowance for loan losses account

against IBI or any IBI Subsidiary that is reasonably likely, individually or
in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Change. There is no
injunction, order, judgment or decree imposed upon IBI or any IBI Subsidiary
or the assets or Property of IBI or any IBI Subsidiary that has resulted in,
or is reasonably likely to result in, a Material Adverse Change.

execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the agreements
contemplated hereby, or the consummation by IBI or any IBI Subsidiary of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. To its Best Knowledge, IBI is
not aware of any fact or circumstance regarding IBI or any of the IBI
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be likely to materially impede or delay
IBGs ability to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals to consummate the
Merger in a timely manner.

Subsidiary has any material liability or obligation, accrued, absolute,

respect to any real property securing any indebtedness reflected as an asset
of Integrity Bank. With respect to any loan or other evidence

A. Set forth on _Confidential Schedule 3.29_ is a complete and correct list

benefit plans as defined in Code § 6039D, and all other bonus, incentive,
compensation, deferred compensation, profit

 



27  sharing, stock option, stock appreciation right, stock bonus, stock
purchase, employee stock ownership, savings, severance, supplemental
unemployment, layoff, salary continuation, retirement, pension, health, life
insurance, disability, group insurance, vacation, holiday, sick leave, fringe
benefit or welfare plan, or any other similar plan, agreement, policy or
understanding (whether written or oral, qualified or nonqualified), and
any trust, escrow or other agreement related thereto, which (a) is currently
maintained or contributed to by IBI or any IBI Subsidiary, or with respect to
which IBI or any IBI Subsidiary has any liability, and (b) provides benefits
to any officer, employee, service provider, former officer or former employee
of IBI or any IBI Subsidiary, or the dependents of any thereof, regardless of
whether funded or unfunded (herein collectively the " _Employee Plans_ " and
each individually an " _Employee Plan_ ").

B. No Employee Plan is a defined benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA.
IBI has delivered or made available to IBG true, accurate and complete copies
of the documents comprising each Employee Plan and any related trust
agreements, annuity contracts, insurance policies or any other funding
instruments (" _Funding Arrangements_ "), any contracts with independent
contractors (including actuaries and investment managers) that relate to any
Employee Plan, the Form 5500 filed with the IRS in each of the three (3) most
recent plan years with respect to each Employee Plan, and related schedules
and opinions, and such other documents, records or other materials related
thereto, as reasonably requested by IBG. There have been no prohibited
transactions (described under ERISA §406 or Code §4975(c)), breaches of
fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations of any law applicable to
the Employee Plans and related Funding Arrangements that would reasonably be
expected to subject IBG, Independent Bank, IBI or any IBI Subsidiary to any
material taxes, penalties or other liabilities. Each Employee Plan that is
represented to be qualified under Code §401(a) has a current favorable
determination or opinion letter. All reports, descriptions and
filings required by the Code, ERISA or any government agency with respect to
each Employee Plan have been timely and completely filed or distributed. Each
Employee Plan has been operated in material compliance with applicable law or
in accordance with its terms. There are no pending claims, lawsuits or
actions relating to any Employee Plan (other than ordinary course claims for
benefits) and, to the Best Knowledge of IBI, none are threatened. No written
or, to the Best Knowledge of IBI, oral representations have been made by IBI
or any IBI Subsidiary to any employee or former employee of IBI or any IBI
Subsidiary promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the
continuation of medical, dental, life or disability coverage for such person,
their dependent, or any beneficiary for any period of time beyond the end of
the current plan year or beyond termination of employment (except to the
extent of coverage required under Code §4980B or applicable state law).
Compliance with FAS 106 will not create any material change to the Financial
Statements or the Call Reports. There are no material surrender charges,
penalties, or other costs or fees that would reasonably be expected to be
imposed by any person against IBI, any IBI Subsidiary, an Employee Plan, or
any other person, including an Employee Plan participant or beneficiary, as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with respect to any insurance, annuity or investment contracts or other
similar investment held by any Employee Plan.

 



28 C. With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to, currently or in
the past six (6) years, by any trade or business with which IBI or any IBI
Subsidiary is required by any of the rules contained in the Code or ERISA to
be treated as a single employer (" _Controlled Group Plans_ "):

1. All Controlled Group Plans which are "group health plans" (as defined in the Code and ERISA) have been operated before the Closing such that failures to operate such group health plans in compliance, in all material respects, with Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA and Code § § 4980B and 4980D would not reasonably be expected to subject IBI or any IBI Subsidiary to material liability; 

 

2. There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a defined benefit plan (as defined in ERISA), nor has there been a Controlled Group Plan that is a defined benefit plan in the last five (5) calendar years; and 

 

3. There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" or "multi-employer plan" (as either such term is defined in ERISA), nor has there been a Controlled Group Plan that is either a multiple employer plan or multi-employer plan since 2007. 

 

D. All Employee Plan documents, annual reports or returns, audited or
audited financial statements, actuarial valuations, summary annual reports,
and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to the Employee Plans are
correct, complete, and current in all material respects, have been timely
filed, and there have been no material changes in the information set forth
therein.

E. All contributions (including all employer contributions, employee
salary reduction contributions and all premiums or other payments (other than
claims)) that are due have been made with respect to each Employee Plan.

termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or benefit plan
currently in effect will be an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is

desire to make of the affairs of IBI and each IBI Subsidiary, including access
sufficient to verify the value of the assets and the liabilities of IBI and
each IBI Subsidiary and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to
IBGs obligations described in ARTICLE VIII; provided, however, that IBG
shall request permission for all such access reasonably in advance and all
such access shall be conducted in a manner designed to minimize disruption to
the normal business operations and employee or customer relations of IBI and
each IBI Subsidiary. IBI agrees at any time, and from time to time, to furnish
to IBG as soon as practicable, any additional information that IBG may
reasonably request, and shall specifically provide to IBG a weekly written
report of all loans made, renewed or modified by Integrity Bank. No
investigation by IBG or its representatives shall affect the representations
and warranties set forth herein; provided, however, that IBG shall promptly
notify IBI to the extent that IBGs investigation determines that any of the
representations and warranties by IBI set forth in ARTICLE III are untrue.

 



42 Section 5.06. _Allowance for Loan Losses_. IBI shall cause Integrity Bank
to maintain its Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (the " _Allowance_ ") at a
level necessary to fully reserve for the potential for loss on its loans and
other real estate owned consistent with Integrity Banks historical
methodology and in compliance with GAAP and RAP and at a level satisfactory to
IBG in its reasonable discretion. To the extent that the loans listed on
_Confidential Schedule 5.06_ have not been paid off or otherwise resolved to
the reasonable satisfaction of IBG prior to the Calculation Date, then prior
to the Calculation Date, IBI shall cause Integrity Bank to fully reserve for
the potential for loss associated with such loans in the amounts set forth
on  _Confidential Schedule 5.06_. The calculation of Tangible Equity shall
include (as a deduction) the amount of any provision expense made by Integrity
Bank to comply with the requirements of this Section 5.06.

 

Section 5.07. _Untrue Representations_. IBI shall promptly notify IBG in
writing if IBI becomes aware of any fact or condition that makes untrue, or
shows to have been untrue, in any material respect, any material written
information provided by IBI to IBG, any confidential schedule to this
Agreement or any representation or warranty made by IBI in ARTICLE III or
that results in IBIs failure to comply with any covenant, condition or
agreement contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 5.08. _Litigation and Claims_. IBI shall promptly notify IBG in
writing of any litigation, or of any claim, controversy or contingent
liability that is reasonably expected to become the subject of litigation,
against IBI or any IBI Subsidiary or affecting any of their Properties, if
such litigation or potential litigation is reasonably likely, in the event of
an unfavorable outcome, to result in a Material Adverse Change to IBI or any
IBI Subsidiary. IBI shall promptly notify IBG of any legal action, suit or
proceeding or judicial, administrative or governmental investigation, pending
or, to the Best Knowledge of IBI, threatened against IBI or any IBI Subsidiary
that (i) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of
this Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby, or any actions taken
or to be taken by IBI or any IBI Subsidiary pursuant hereto or (ii) seeks to
enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

Section 5.09. _Adverse Changes_. IBI shall promptly notify IBG in writing
if any change shall have occurred or, to the Best Knowledge of IBI, been
threatened (or any development shall have occurred or, to the Best Knowledge
of IBI, been threatened involving a prospective change) in the business,
financial condition or operations of IBI and/or any IBI Subsidiary that has
resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change to IBI or any IBI Subsidiary.

 

Section 5.10. _No Negotiation with Others._ __

 

A. IBI agrees that it shall not, and that it shall cause each IBI
Subsidiary and the respective employees, directors, officers, financial
advisors and agents of IBI and Integrity Bank (collectively, " _IBI
Representatives_ ") not to (i) solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or
participate in any negotiations or discussions with any third party (except
for the limited purpose of notifying such person of the existence of the
provisions of this Section 5.10) regarding an Acquisition Proposal (as defined
below), whether by acquisition, business combination, purchase of securities
or assets or otherwise; (ii) disclose to any third party any information
concerning the

 



43  business, Properties, books or records of IBI or any IBI Subsidiary in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, other than as provided herein or as
compelled by law; or (iii) cooperate with any third party to make any
Acquisition Proposal, other than the sale by IBI or any IBI Subsidiary of
assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices.
Promptly upon receipt of any unsolicited offer for an Acquisition Proposal,
IBI will communicate to IBG the terms of any proposal or request for
information and the identity of the parties involved.

 

B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.10,
if at any time after the date hereof and before the Closing, IBI and the IBI
Representatives, having each theretofore complied with the terms of Section
5.10(A), receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, IBI
and the IBI Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with,
and furnish any information and other access (so long as all such information
and access has previously been made available to IBG or is made available to
IBG before or concurrently with the time such information or access is made
available to such person) to, any person making such Acquisition Proposal if,
and only if, the IBI Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal and financial advisors, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal is
or is reasonably capable of becoming a Superior Proposal (as defined below)
and (ii) the failure of the IBI Board to furnish such information or access or
enter into such discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected
to be materially inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the IBI
shareholders; but before furnishing any material nonpublic information, IBI
shall have received from the person making such Acquisition Proposal an
executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all
material respects on such person as the Nondisclosure Agreement entered into
with IBG on May 2, 2017, which confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit
IBI from complying with the terms of this Section 5.10. IBI will promptly,
and in any event within two business days, (x) notify IBG in writing of the
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
relating to IBI or for access to the Properties, books or records of IBI by
any person that has made, or to the Best Knowledge of IBI may be considering
making, an Acquisition Proposal and (y) communicate the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal to IBG, including as they may change upon any
modification or amendment to the terms thereof. IBI will keep IBG reasonably
apprised of the status of and other matters relating to any such Acquisition
Proposal on a timely basis.

 

C. Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall prevent IBI or the IBI
Board from (i) taking the actions provided in Sections 1.09(C) or 5.10(B),
(ii) responding to an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the sole
purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) informing any person who submits an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal of IBIs obligations pursuant to Section 5.10(A) or (iv) in
consultation with outside counsel, complying with its disclosure obligations
under federal or state law in connection with a Change in Recommendation.

D. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a
written offer or proposal from a party other than IBG which contains a fixed
price per share or a mathematically ascertainable formula for calculating a
price per share for the IBI Share regarding any of the following (other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving IBI: (i) any
merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
business combination, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the

 



44  assets or equity securities or deposits of, IBI, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions which could reasonably be expected to impede,
interfere with, prevent or materially delay the completion of the Merger; or
(ii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding IBI
Shares or the filing of a registration statement in connection therewith.

 

E. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona
fide Acquisition Proposal made by a party other than IBG that the IBI Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside
counsel and its independent financial advisor (i) is or would result in a
transaction that if consummated would be more favorable to IBIs shareholders
from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all of the
terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any
proposal by IBG to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) is capable of
being, and is reasonably likely to be, consummated on the terms so proposed
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal.

 

Section 5.11. _Non-Governmental Consents and Approvals_. IBI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals from
third parties listed on _Confidential Schedule 3.05_. IBI will cooperate in
all commercially reasonable respects with IBG to obtain all such approvals
and consents required of IBG.

Section 5.12. _Environmental Investigation; Right to Terminate Agreement._
 

A. IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives, at the sole cost
and expense of IBG, shall have the right to the same extent that IBI has the
right, but not the obligation or responsibility, to inspect any Property,
including conducting asbestos surveys and sampling, environmental assessments
and investigation, and other environmental surveys and analyses including
soil and ground sampling (" _Environmental Inspections_ "). IBG shall notify
IBI in writing before any Environmental Inspection, and IBI may place
reasonable restrictions on the time of such Environmental Inspection. If, as
a result of any such Environmental Inspection, further investigation ("
_Secondary Investigation_ ") including, test borings, soil, water and other
sampling is deemed desirable by IBG, IBG shall (i) notify IBI in writing
of any Property for which it intends to conduct such a Secondary
Investigation and the reasons for the Secondary Investigation, and (ii) at the
sole cost and expense of IBG, commence the Secondary Investigation. IBG shall
give reasonable written notice to IBI of the Secondary Investigation, and IBI
may place reasonable time and place restrictions on the Secondary
Investigation.

 

B. IBG shall make available to IBI the results and reports of such
Environmental Inspections and Secondary Investigations promptly after IBG
receives or is advised of such results. IBG shall not have any liability or
responsibility of any nature whatsoever for the results, conclusions or other
findings related to any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or
other environmental survey. If this Agreement is terminated, except as
otherwise required by law, reports to any Governmental Authority of the
results of any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other
environmental survey shall not be made by IBG. IBG shall make no such report
before Closing unless required to do so by applicable law, and in such case
will give IBI reasonable written notice of IBGs intentions.

 



45 C. IBG shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by
providing written notice to IBI within ninety (90) days following the date of
this Agreement if, with respect to the Properties (as defined in Section
11.10) only, (i) the factual substance of any warranty or representation set
forth in Section 3.22 is not materially true and accurate; (ii) the results
of an Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation are disapproved by
IBG because such Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation
identifies material violations Environmental Laws that would result in a
Material Adverse Change to IBI or any IBI Subsidiary; (iii) IBI has refused to
allow IBG to conduct an Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation in
a manner that IBG reasonably considers necessary; (iv) the Environmental
Inspection or Secondary Investigation identifies any past or present event,
condition or circumstance that would result in a Material Adverse Change to
IBI or any IBI Subsidiary; (v) the Environmental Inspection or Secondary
Investigation identifies the presence of any underground or above ground
storage tank in, on or under any Property that is not shown to be in material
compliance with all Environmental Laws applicable to the tank either at the
date of this Agreement or at a future time certain, or that has had a release
of petroleum or some other Hazardous Material that has not been cleaned up to
the satisfaction of the relevant Governmental Authority or any other
party with a legal right to compel cleanup; or (vi) the Environmental
Inspection or Secondary Investigation identifies the presence of any asbestos-
containing material in, on or under any Property, the removal of which would
result in a Material Adverse Change. IBG shall advise IBI in writing (the "
_Environmental Notice_ ") as to whether IBG intends to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.12(C). Upon receipt of the Environmental
Notice, IBI shall have the opportunity to correct any objected to violations
or conditions to IBGs reasonable satisfaction within 30 days after the date
of the Environmental Notice. If IBI fails to demonstrate correction of the
violations or conditions to the reasonable satisfaction of IBG, IBG may
terminate the Agreement on the 31st day after the date of the Environmental
Notice.

 

D. IBI agrees to make available to IBG and its consultants, agents and
representatives all documents and other material relating to environmental
conditions of any Property including the results of other environmental
inspections and surveys. IBI also agrees that all engineers and consultants
who prepared or furnished such reports may discuss such reports
and information with IBG and shall be entitled to certify the same in favor
of IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives and make all other data
available to IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives.

 

Section 5.13. _Employee Plans and Employee Contracts_. Before the Closing
Date, IBI shall and shall cause each IBI Subsidiary to terminate the Employee

for or make the payments required pursuant to the Employment Contracts as set
forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.20_ , and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from each applicable officer an acknowledgement regarding
the termination of their Employment Contract in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Employment Contract
Acknowledgements_ "). __

 

Section 5.14. _Confidential Schedules_. At least three business days
before the Closing, IBI agrees to provide IBG with supplemental _Confidential
Schedules_ to be delivered by IBI pursuant to this Agreement reflecting any
material changes thereto between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date. Any such supplemental _Confidential Schedules_ shall be

 



46  deemed to modify the representations and warranties of IBI for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty
of IBI in Article III hereof; provided, however, that such supplemental

of IBI for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of the
representations and warranties of IBI pursuant to Section 8.01 of this
Agreement.

contemplated hereby, including the Merger, subject to required regulatory
approvals for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.16. _Releases_. IBI shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from each of the directors and executive officers of IBI

contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

may reasonably request regarding both the ownership and prior transfers of

Exchange Agent, at least ten days prior to the Closing Date. 

Section 5.20. _Conforming Accounting Adjustments_. IBI shall, if requested
in writing by IBG, consistent with GAAP, RAP and applicable banking laws and
regulations, immediately before Closing, make such accounting entries as IBI
may reasonably request in order to conform the accounting records of IBI to
the accounting policies and practices of IBG. No such adjustment by IBI or
any IBI Subsidiary shall of itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation or failure by IBI or any IBI Subsidiary to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or constitute grounds for termination of

 



47  this Agreement by IBG or be an acknowledgment by IBI of any adverse
circumstances for purposes of determining whether the conditions to IBGs
obligations under this Agreement have been satisfied, nor will any such
adjustment affect the calculation of the Tangible Equity under Section 1.05.
The recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any
misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and
shall not be construed as concurrence by IBI, any IBI Subsidiary or their
respective management with any such adjustments.

 

Section 5.21. _D_ __ _ and O Liability Insurance_. Contemporaneously with
the Closing, IBI shall purchase an extended reporting period for four (4)

waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party in the manner provided in Section 11.17, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No party to this
Agreement shall by any act (except by a written instrument given pursuant
to Section 11.17) be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or
to have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No
failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising any right, power or privilege

shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such party would
otherwise have on any future occasion or to any right or remedy that any other
party may have hereunder.

 



66 Section 11.17. _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors,
at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the IBI
shareholders; but after the approval of this Agreement by the IBI

shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that decreases the consideration

Independent Bank Group, Inc.

1600 Redbud Blvd., Suite 400

 

McKinney, TX 75069

Gentlemen:

 

Reference is hereby made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization,
dated as of November , 2017 (the "Reorganization Agreement") by and
between Independent Bank Group, Inc. ("IBG") and Integrity Bancshares, Inc.
("IBI"). Terms with their initial letter capitalized and not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings given them in the Reorganization Agreement.

I have previously been granted options (the "Options") to acquire shares of
IBI common stock as set forth on Schedule 1 attached to this Option
Cancellation Agreement. I have no other options or rights to acquire shares of
common stock or other securities of IBI or Integrity Bank. Pursuant to the
Reorganization Agreement, all of my Options that were previously unvested are
now fully vested.

I have elected not to exercise my Options. Accordingly, upon consummation of
the merger contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, my Options will be
converted into the right to receive cash in the amount of the Non-Exercising
Option Holder Payment. I recognize that the receipt of the Non-exercising
Option Holder Payment is subject to federal income tax and FICA withholding.

As long as the Reorganization Agreement is in effect, I agree not to exercise
any of my Options. I agree to accept the Non-Exercising Option Holder Payment
provided for in the Reorganization Agreement and as described herein in full
satisfaction of my rights with respect to my Options and as consideration for
the termination and cancellation of my Options. I understand and agree that
this Option Cancellation Agreement amends my rights with respect to the
Options so that, upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Reorganization Agreement, my Options shall terminate and be cancelled, and
will represent solely the right to receive the Non-Exercising Option Holder
Payment provided for in the Reorganization Agreement. I further agree to take
such additional actions and deliver such additional documents and certificates
as may be reasonably requested by IBG to effect the transactions described in
this Option Cancellation Agreement and in the Reorganization Agreement
pertaining to the Options.
