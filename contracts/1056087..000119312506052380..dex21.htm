_W I T N E S S E T H :_

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company
have adopted this Agreement and determined that the merger of the Company
with and into Parent, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ") is advisable;

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with
this Agreement;

WHEREAS, it is contemplated that, immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, holders of shares of Class B common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Parent (" _Parent Class B Stock_ ") representing at least a majority
of all votes entitled to be cast by holders of Parent Common Stock (as
hereinafter defined) and Parent Class B Stock, voting together as a class,
will, pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL (as hereinafter defined), take
action by written consent (the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_ ") to (i) adopt
this Agreement, (ii) approve the amendment of the certificate of
incorporation of Parent to read as set forth in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto
(the " _Certificate Amendment_ ") and (iii) approve the issuance of the shares
of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Stock Issuance_
"); and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement will be, and
hereby is, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent and the Company agree as follows:

the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Florida Business Corporation
Act (the " _FBCA_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_
"), the Company shall be merged with and into Parent, whereupon the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease, and Parent shall continue as
the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, 650 Page Mill
Road, Palo Alto, California at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be
specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law (as hereinafter defined))
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date and

Secretary of State of the State of Florida and the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such
later time as shall be set forth in the Articles of Merger and the
Certificate of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective is referred
to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "). The Articles of Merger and the

practicable, at the same time.

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the FBCA and

Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Parent shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Parent shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided
under the FBCA and the DGCL. 

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_.

(a) The certificate of incorporation of Parent shall be amended in the Merger
to read in its entirety in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_, and
with such amendment shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof
and hereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations
set forth in Section 5.9.

(b) The by-laws of Parent as in effect at the Effective Time, in the form
attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ , shall be the by-laws of the Surviving

and hereof and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations
set forth in Section 5.9. 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law and Section 5.15, the

and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. 



 

-2- Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of Parent immediately prior to the
Closing Date shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time and shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation

ARTICLE II

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Parent:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.1(b) and
2.1(d), each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value two and
one-twelfth cents per share, of the Company (together with the associated
rights under the Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined)) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares and associated rights,
collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ "), other than
any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent provided in, Section
2.1(b)) shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive the combination of (x) $40.00 in cash without
interest (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ ") and (y) 0.5118 of a share of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(as hereinafter defined) (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 2.1(d) (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_
"). All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive (i) the
Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.2(h) and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional share of Class A common stock of Parent, par value $.01 per share
(" _Parent Common Stock_ "  _provided_ that "Parent Common Stock" shall mean
the Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time) in accordance with Section 2.3.

(b) _Parent-Owned and Treasury Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf
of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

(c) _Treatment of Parent Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Parent issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
as one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and each



 

-3- share of Parent Class B Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding as one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class B common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period
(excluding, in each case, normal quarterly cash dividends), the Per Share
Cash Amount, the Exchange Ratio and/or any other similarly dependent items
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

(e) _Dissenters  Rights_.

(i) No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to
shares of capital stock of the Company or shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger.

(ii) Shares of Parent Class B Stock shall be entitled to appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262(b) of the DGCL. Any shares of Parent Class B Stock
held by a holder who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall, from and after the Effective Time, no longer be
entitled to be voted for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions thereon (except dividends or other distributions payable
to stockholders of record as of a date which is prior to the Effective Time)
and the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided
by the DGCL.

(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1(e)(ii), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL, then,
upon the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall represent
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed to act as an exchange agent hereunder and approved in advance by
the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of holders of the Shares, certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares),
payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, (ii) the amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 5.5(a) and (iii)
the amounts to be



 

-4- paid pursuant to Section 2.3. Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to
make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in
U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant
to Section 2.2(h). Any cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent (including the amount of any dividends or
other distributions payable with respect thereto and such cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 2.3) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (x) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (y) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such properly surrendered
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or such Book-
Entry Shares (x) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.1 and (y) an amount in cash equal to the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1 and this Article II, including cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3 and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(h). No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the relevant Merger Consideration to be
issued or paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued or paid to
such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes (as hereinafter defined) have been paid or are not applicable.

(iii) The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares,
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over
to the applicable Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined), such withheld
or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding were made.



 

-5- (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the relevant Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand,
and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in
accordance with Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their shares.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this
Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section
2.2(d).

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent or reasonably requested by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate (and such affidavit of loss shall not be deemed effective
without the posting of such bond if required hereunder), the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check
in the amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

(h) _Dividends and Other Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
until such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in
this Section 2.2. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, an amount equal to all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on
or prior to the date of such surrender and not



 

-6- previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, an amount equal to
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

Section 2.3 _Fractional Shares_.

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3, a cash payment
in lieu of such fractional share of Company Common Stock representing such
holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the excess of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section
2.2(a) over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 2.2(b)
(such excess being hereinafter referred to as the " _Excess Shares_ "). As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent
for the holders of the Certificates representing Shares, shall sell the Excess
Shares at then prevailing prices in the manner provided in the following
paragraph.

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders that would otherwise receive fractional shares, shall be executed
on the New York Stock Exchange at then-prevailing market prices in round lots
to the extent practicable. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Shares, the Exchange Agent shall hold such
proceeds for the holders of Shares (the " _Fractional Shares Fund_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Fractional Shares Fund to
which each holder of Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Fractional Shares Fund by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Shares would otherwise be entitled.

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to
such holders of Shares without interest, subject to and in accordance with
Section 2.3.

and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in

operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly
existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, any reference to any facts, circumstances,
events or changes having a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means such
facts, circumstances, events or changes that are, or would reasonably be
expected to become, materially adverse to the business, financial condition or

violation of applicable Law relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or (iii) changes in applicable Law, GAAP or accounting
standards. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the date of this



 

-22- Agreement a true and complete copy of the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of Parent, each as amended through the date hereof. Parent is not in

approvals or filings, that, if not obtained or made, would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement does not, and,
except as described in Section 4.3(b), the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i)
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or any of its

ordinary course of business, (C) which is disclosed on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of Parent or notes thereto or securing liabilities
reflected on such balance sheet or (D) which was incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the date of the most recent consolidated balance
sheet of Parent and is immaterial in amount (each of the foregoing, a "
_Parent Permitted Lien_ "), upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or
any of its

of the articles of incorporation or by-laws or other equivalent
organizational document, in each case as amended, of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or violate any applicable Laws, other

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

(a) Parent has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required
to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since December 28, 2003 (the "
_Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of the last such amendment prior to the
date hereof, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and, as
of their respective dates, none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the respective periods indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed assessment of the
effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 25, 2005, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective and Parents independent registered accountant has
issued (and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report
concluding that Parent maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 25, 2005.

obligations which have been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course
of business, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of
Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be

Termination Date, to the properties, employees, contracts, commitments, books
and records of such party and its Subsidiaries and any report, schedule or
other document filed or received by such party pursuant to the requirements of
applicable Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent
shall be required to afford such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, would cause a significant risk, in the reasonable judgment of the
disclosing party, of a loss of privilege to the disclosing party, or any of
its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law, nor
shall the Company or Parent or any of their



 

-39- respective Representatives be permitted to perform any invasive onsite
environmental procedure with respect to any property of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement dated November 23, 2005 and a
Confidentiality Agreement dated February 23, 2006 (together, the "

Parent and the Company will hold, and will cause its respective directors,
officers, employees, agents and advisors (including attorneys, accountants,
consultants, bankers and financial advisors) to hold, any Evaluation
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreements) confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to Sections 5.3(b)-(e), the Company agrees that neither it nor any
Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiry with
respect to, or the making, submission or announcement of, any Alternative
Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) participate in any negotiations
regarding an Alternative Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information
regarding an Alternative Proposal to, any person that has made or, to the
Companys knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal, (iii)
engage in discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal with any person that
has made or, to the Companys knowledge, is considering making an Alternative
Proposal, except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions
of this Section 5.3, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative
Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or
any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for
confidentiality agreements permitted under Section 5.3(b)).

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 5.3(a), prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives an
Alternative Proposal which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) which
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith is reasonably
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take the following
actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such
Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar, with respect to
confidentiality _(provided_ , that if any confidentiality agreement with such
third party does not contain standstill provisions or contains standstill
provisions more favorable to such third party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements, then the Company shall execute and deliver to
Parent a waiver of the standstill provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements
such that Parent will not be subject to greater standstill restrictions in
any respect than the third party making such Alternative Proposal), to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreements and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal.
Upon receipt by the Company after the date hereof of any Alternative Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information which it reasonably believes would
lead to an Alternative Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with oral
and written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal, or of such request or inquiry and



 

-40- shall provide Parent with such reasonable information as is reasonably
necessary to keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to any material
current developments regarding any such Alternative Proposal, or regarding any
such request or inquiry.

(c) In response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, withdraw, modify or qualify the
Company Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") if the Board of
Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure of the
Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary obligations to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall send Parent written notice of its intention to effect a Change
of Recommendation at least three (3) business days prior to effecting a Change
of Recommendation.

(d) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject
to Section 5.3(c) and not subject to this Section 5.3(d)), nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the Company
from making a Change of Recommendation to the extent that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors
of the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely
to result in a breach of the directors fiduciary obligations to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall send Parent written notice of its intention to effect a Change of
Recommendation at least three (3) business days prior to effecting a Change of
Recommendation. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not make
any Change of Recommendation other than in compliance with and as permitted
by Section 5.3(c) or this Section 5.3(d).

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, _provided_
that the foregoing shall not relieve the Company and its Board of Directors
from complying with this Section 5.3 and Section 5.4.

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide proposal or offer made by any person (other than a proposal or offer by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for (i) a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) the acquisition
by any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) the acquisition by any
person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class
of capital stock of the Company or fifteen percent (15%) or more of the voting
power represented by the outstanding voting securities of the Company.

(g) As used in this Agreement " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
unsolicited bona fide written offer made by a third party to acquire all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole
or at least a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of the
Company on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in



 

-41- good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial and legal
advisors, and considering such factors as the Companys Board of Directors
considers to be appropriate (including the timing, ability to finance and
likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the
Company and its shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause
to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials for the
shareholders of the Company and an information statement pursuant to Rule
14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act for the stockholders of Parent that
shall together constitute the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Parent and the
Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Form S-4. The
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will include notice to stockholders required by
Section 262(d)(1) of the DGCL that appraisal rights will be available with
respect to Parent Class B Stock and notice to stockholders required by Section
228(e) of the DGCL that the stockholders of Parent have taken action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent. The
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus in and will
constitute a part of the Form S-4 as Parents prospectus. Each of Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective
by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company shall,
as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide each other with
copies of any written comments, and advise each other of any oral comments,
with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from the
SEC. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and provide each other with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with
the SEC, and each will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made
with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without the approval of
both Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that, the Company, in connection
with a Change of Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 (including by incorporation by reference) to
effect such a Change of Recommendation. The Company and Parent will use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed
to Company shareholders and Parent stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent and
the Company will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of
any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the
Company and such information should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that
any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party hereto discovering  



 

-42-  such information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the extent
required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in order to lift
any injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and its articles
of incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "), and (ii) use all
reasonable efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law
and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws to effectuate, immediately
following the execution of this Agreement, the Parent Stockholder Approval by
means of a written consent in the form set forth in Section 6.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and to comply with all requirements under the
Exchange Act relating to the Parent Stockholder Approval as promptly
as practicable. The Board of Directors of the Company shall take any actions
and make any determinations required under paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) of
Article TENTH of the Companys articles of incorporation as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary
to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to its shareholders in advance of the vote to
be held at the Company Meeting, or, if as of the time for which the Company
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/
Prospectus) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting. Except to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.3(c) or
5.3(d), as applicable: (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall
recommend that the Company shareholders vote in favor of approval of this
Agreement and the Merger at the Company Meeting, (ii) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of
Directors of the Company has recommended that the Companys shareholders vote
in favor of approval of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Meeting,
and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company that the stockholders of the Company vote in
favor of approval of this Agreement and the Merger.



 

-43- Section 5.5 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards; Employee Matters_.

(a) _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of the
Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding as of a date that is seven days prior to the Effective Time shall,
as of a date that is seven days prior to the Effective Time, immediately vest
as to 100% of the shares subject to such Company Stock Option and shall, to
the extent not exercised prior, be cashed out at the Effective Time for an
amount equal to the Option Consideration. The " _Option Consideration_ " shall
mean for each Company Stock Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess, if
any, of (A) the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercisable of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (2) the
sum of (x) the Per Share Cash Amount plus (y) the product of the Exchange
Ratio multiplied by the closing price per share of the Parent Common Stock on
the last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the cash amount
equal to the sum of (x) and (y), the " _Equity Award Consideration_ ") over
(B) the aggregate exercise price of such Company Stock Option.

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits
measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or Company Benefit Plans
(including performance shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
phantom units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents, but not
including any 401(k) plan of the Company), other than Restricted Shares
(as hereinafter defined), Purchase Plan Shares (as hereinafter defined) and
Company Stock Options (each, other than Restricted Shares, Purchase Plan
Shares and Company Stock Options, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_ "), whether
vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be fully vested and converted into a right to receive the Equity
Award Consideration per share of Company Common Stock to which such Company
Stock-Based Award makes reference to be paid to holders of such rights in
accordance with the terms of such rights.

(iii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted
Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest in full and be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(a).

(iv) At the Effective Time, the Companys Employees Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Stock Purchase Plan_ ") shall terminate. In connection with such
termination, the last day of the final Purchase Period (as defined in the
Stock Purchase Plan) shall be deemed to be the date that is seven days prior
to the Effective Time, as a result of which each participant therein shall be
entitled to purchase prior to the Effective Time a number of whole shares of
Company Common Stock calculated pursuant to Section IX of the Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _Purchase Plan Shares_ ") and the Company shall retain accumulated
payroll deductions, thereby causing all such Purchase Plan Shares to be
shares of Company Common Stock that are converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a).



 

-44- (v) The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company pass
such resolutions as are reasonably necessary with respect to the Company
Stock Options, Company Stock-Based Awards, the Restricted Shares and the
Purchase Plan Shares to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.5. Such resolutions shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(b) _Employee Matters_. 

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit
Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit Parent from amending or terminating, or from causing
the Company to amend or terminate, any such Benefit Plans, arrangements
or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required by
applicable Law. From the Effective Time until December 31, 2006, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each active employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries other than such employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements (" _Company Employees_ ") compensation and benefits that
are reasonably equivalent in the aggregate to the Company Benefit Plans that
such Company Employees participated in prior to the Effective Time (other
than with respect to equity compensation, annual or other periodic cash
incentive compensation, and payment upon separation from service). From
January 1, 2007 until December 31, 2007, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
to be provided, to each Company Employee compensation and benefits that are
(1) reasonably equivalent in the aggregate to the Company Benefit Plans that
such Company Employees participated in prior to the Effective Time (other
than with respect to equity compensation, annual or other periodic cash
incentive compensation, and payment upon separation from service) or, at the
discretion of Parent, or (2) substantially equivalent, in the aggregate, to
the compensation and benefits of similarly situated employees of Parent. After
December 31, 2007, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
compensation and benefits substantially equivalent, in the aggregate, to
the compensation and benefits of similarly situated employees of Parent.

(ii) Parent agrees to the additional matters set forth on Section 5.5(b)(ii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may
amend any 401(k) plan of the Company to eliminate employer securities as an
investment alternative with respect to new employee contributions or matching
contributions.

(iii) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall subject to
applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect
to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
and without limiting the



 

-45- generality of the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans
to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "),
and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(iv) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the Company Stock Plans and the Company Benefit
Plans, as applicable, will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as
applicable.

(v) Until December 31, 2006, Parent agrees to continue or cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue the Companys retiree welfare programs, including
medical prescription drugs and retiree life insurance program (the " _Company
Retiree Welfare Programs_ ") on terms and conditions substantially equivalent
in duration, scope, value, participant cost, vesting and otherwise to those
in effect as of the Effective Time with respect to all Company employees and
retirees who (A) as of the time immediately prior to the Effective Time are
receiving benefits under the Company Retiree Welfare Programs or (B) as of
the time immediately prior to the Effective Time would be eligible to receive
benefits under the Company Retiree Welfare Programs as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (" _Covered Retirees_ "). After December 31, 2006,
Parent agrees to continue, without any lapse in coverage, retiree welfare
programs for Covered Retirees under, in the discretion of Parent, (A) the
Company Retiree Welfare Programs or (B) the retiree welfare programs
maintained by Parent as of immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any Covered Retiree who retired
prior to December 31, 1993, Parent shall continue the Company Retiree Welfare
Program on terms and conditions no less favorable in duration, scope, value,
participant cost, vesting and otherwise than those in effect as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time with respect to such Covered Retirees.

(vi) The Company shall pay, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Employee employed as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and then participating in any Company Benefit Plan that is an annual
bonus plan (a " _Bonus Plan_ "), a bonus equal to the product of (A) the
Company Employees bonus entitlement under such plans for the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs, based on the Companys actual performance
and the Company Employees achievement of performance goals for the period
beginning at the beginning of the year in which the Effective Time occurs and
ending as of the end of the month immediately preceding the month in which
the Effective Time occurs (or as of



 

-46- the end of the month immediately preceding the end of the month in which the
Effective Time occurs if the Effective Time coincides with the end of the
month) (the " _Measurement Date_ ") and (B) a fraction, the numerator of which
shall equal the number of days in the calendar year through the Measurement
Date and the denominator of which is 365 (the " _Pro Rata Bonus_ "). If the
Effective Time occurs after December 2006, the Company shall be permitted to
establish a Bonus Plan for 2007, based upon targets and goals substantially
similar to those established for 2006. Following the payment of Pro Rata
Bonuses as set forth above, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to (A)
maintain a bonus plan for the remainder of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs on the same terms and conditions and pursuant to the
same targets and performance measures as were in effect for the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs, although the performance measures by which
bonus achievement is measured may be modified by the Company. Company
performance in respect of calculations made under the Bonus Plans for the
calendar year 2006 shall be calculated without taking into account any adverse
impact on performance in connection with the Proposed Divestitures and any
expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Proposed Divestitures, or any
non-recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been
incurred had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred,
and for the 2006 calendar year shall not be subject to negative discretion by
the administrator for the Bonus Plan.

(c) _Communications_. The Company shall not communicate in writing to groups
of Company employees and/or Company retirees, regarding any matters discussed
in this Section 5.5 without the consent of Parent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned and to be rendered promptly.
The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers and the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company not to make any formal, oral
communications to groups of Company employees and/or Company retirees that
are inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 5.5.

(d) _WARN Act_. Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each to provide
any notice required under the WARN Act or similar local laws, including in
connection with the Proposed Divestitures and Parent shall provide the Company
with all information required to issue such notices required prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) _Divestitures_. Parent shall require any acquiror of any business or
asset of the Company or its Subsidiaries disposed of within twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time and any acquiror of any business or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries constituting part of the Proposed Divestitures
to abide by the obligations set forth in Section 5.5(b)(v) of this Agreement
and Section 5.5(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall satisfy such
obligations itself or, in the case of the obligations set forth in Section
5.5(b)(v) of this Agreement, shall arrange for or shall cause such acquiror to
arrange for the provision of reasonably equivalent benefits to satisfy such
obligations.

(f) _Parent Benefit Plans_. All benefit plans of Parent, including without
limitation all stock option and stock purchase plans, shall survive
and remain in effect immediately following the Merger.



 

-47- (g) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The language of this Section 5.5 is not
intended to and shall not confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder and the rights of any third party,
including employees and retirees, shall be governed only by the terms of the
Company Benefit Plans.

Section 5.6 _Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its best efforts (subject to, and in accordance
with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and

or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no event
later than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof (unless extended by mutual
agreement of the parties) make their respective filings and thereafter make
any other required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use best efforts to
cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required
to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals
are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental
Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely
making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits,

reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United
States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may
assert under Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
expeditiously possible (and in any event shall use best efforts to cause the
Closing to occur by September 30, 2006), including, without limitation (x)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of



 

-48- Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) or
affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations)
businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
Closing, _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 5.6(b)(iii)
shall require or be construed to require any of Parent or the Company to take
any action, propose or make any divestiture or other undertaking, or propose
or enter into any consent decree, except (A) for those that would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the material and
significant benefits that are expected to be derived from the Merger and the
other transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement or (B) as are
listed on Section 5.6(b)(iii) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and (iv)
subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications between the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, and any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit
counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of the
Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), each of
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
shall use their respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(c) so long as such
party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this
Section 5.6. 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act
of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign statutes,
rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and
other Laws, including without limitation any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Laws, that are designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition, (ii)
preserve or promote diversity of media ownership or (iii) protect the national
security or the national economy of any nation.



 

-49- Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such
press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press
release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Parent and the
Company agree to issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or by-
laws or other organization documents or in any agreement to which the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries is a party shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of any Company
Subsidiarys articles of incorporation and by-laws or similar organization
documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of
their respective directors, officers or employees in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of
expenses provisions of the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and by-laws set forth in _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ hereto in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action (as
hereinafter defined) pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, be jointly and
severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, in accordance
with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section
5.9 without limit as to time.

(b) At and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance
funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current director and officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons
heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest



 

-50- extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred, whether before or after the Effective Time, with respect to
such Indemnified Partys actions or omissions taken in his or her capacity as
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In the event
of any such Action, at and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the
defense of such Action and Parent and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
the defense of any such Action. Parent shall not settle any such Action
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless Parent
assumes full responsibility for such settlement, the settlement grants the
Indemnified Party a complete release in respect of the potential liability
relating to the claims underlying such Action and the terms of such
settlement are not in any way detrimental to the Indemnified Party and such
settlement does not contain any admission detrimental to the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any such Action without the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement does not provide for monetary
damages, the terms of such settlement are not in any way detrimental to
Parent and such settlement does not contain any admission detrimental to
Parent. In the event of any payment under this Section 5.9(b), Parent shall be
subrogated to the extent of such payment to all rights of recovery of the
Indemnified Party with respect to any insurance covering any such liability
(including the insurance set forth in Section 5.1(c)).

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may satisfy
its obligations under this Section 5.9(c) by purchasing a "tail" policy under
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i) has
an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those
persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and
omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the insured than those of
the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the
date hereof. 

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.9.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organization
documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, any
other indemnification arrangement, the FBCA, the DGCL or otherwise. The



 

-51- provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties.

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9. 

Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations, including the operations of the Proposed Divestitures,
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 5.11 _Tax-Free Qualification_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
(a) cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) obtain the opinions of counsel referred to
in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d). Provided the opinion conditions contained in
Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d) of this Agreement have been satisfied, Parent shall
file the opinions described in Section 6.2(d) and 6.3(d) with the SEC by a
post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 promptly following the Closing and
shall report the Merger for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.13  _Affiliates_. Not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
persons who, in the judgment of the Company, may be as of the Effective Time,
"affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each person
identified on such list to deliver to Parent not later than ten (10) days
prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit C_ (an " _Affiliate Agreement_ "). The Company shall notify Parent
from time to time after the delivery of the letter described above of any
person not identified on such letter who then is, or may be, such an
"affiliate" and use its reasonable best efforts to cause each additional
person who is identified as an "affiliate" to execute an Affiliate Agreement.

Section 5.14 _Tax Representation Letters_. __ The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to deliver to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati and
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the
Closing Date and signed by an officer of the Company, containing
representations of the Company, and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati and Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen and Katz a "Tax Representation Letter," dated as of the Closing Date and
signed by an officer of Parent, containing representations of Parent, in each
case as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate



 

-52- to enable Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati to render the opinion described in
Section 6.3(d) of this Agreement and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz to render
the opinion described in Section 6.2(d) of this Agreement.

Section 5.15 _Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The Board of
Directors of Parent will take all actions necessary such that, effective as of
immediately following the Effective Time, two members of the Board
of Directors of the Company acceptable to Parent shall become members of the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.16 _Certain Arrangements_. The Company agrees to provide, and agrees
to cause its Subsidiaries and employees to provide, Parent with such
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of potential sales
of assets or operations of the newspapers listed on Schedule 5.16 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Proposed Divestitures"), the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time as may be reasonably requested
by Parent, including participation in the due diligence and sale processes
for such potential transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to provide such cooperation to the extent it would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or could reasonably be expected to constitute a violation of applicable Law.

Section 5.17  _Mortgage Release_. The Company acknowledges that title to
certain properties of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries appear, in the
official records of the relevant county, to be encumbered by a $1,200,000,000
mortgage dated May 2, 1997, in favor of Citicorp USA, Inc. The Company also
acknowledges that the financial obligations underlying the mortgage have been
paid off, but the documents evidencing the release of such mortgage have not
been filed with the relevant county recorder. The Company shall, prior to the
Closing Date, cause the relevant county recorder to record the releases and/or
reconveyances evidencing the release of this mortgage on all properties of the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries where this mortgage appears of record
and unreleased.

Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained;

(e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other

Proposal. 



 

-56- In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1,

referred to in Section 5.2 and the provisions of Section 7.2 and Article
VIII), and there shall be no other liability on the part of the Company or
Parent to the other except liability arising out of intentional breach of
this Agreement or as provided for in the Confidentiality Agreements, in which
case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity.

Section 7.2 _Termination Fee_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i)
(A) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any Alternative Proposal
(substituting 20% for the 15% thresholds set forth in the definition
of "Alternative Proposal;" _provided_ , that any proposals for the
acquisition of any of the Proposed Divestitures shall not be included in the
calculation of such 20% threshold with respect to assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries) is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and
not withdrawn at the time of, the Company Meeting, (B) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and (C)
concurrently with or within nine (9) months after such termination, a
transaction the proposal of which would constitute an Alternative Proposal
(substituting 50% for the 15% thresholds set forth in the definition of
"Alternative Proposal") (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ ") shall have occurred
or any definitive agreement providing for a Qualifying Transaction shall have
been entered into or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 7.1(g) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then in any such
event the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $171,900,000 in cash, such
payment to be made, in the case of termination by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(g), concurrently with such termination, or in the case of
termination by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(h), two (2) business days after
the date of such termination, or, otherwise, upon the earlier of (i)
consummation of such Qualifying Transaction and (ii) entry into a definitive
agreement providing for a Qualifying Transaction, it being understood that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the fee referred to in this
Section 7.2(a) on more than one occasion.

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company, the
Company shall pay to Parent Parents reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.2 at the
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made. Payment of the fees described in this Section 7.2 shall not be in
lieu of damages incurred in the event of an intentional breach of this
Agreement.

Section 8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed

with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other
than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 8.5, (b) any claim
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

amendment, by the Company and Parent, or, in the case of a waiver, by the
party against whom the waiver is to be effective;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after receipt of Company Shareholder Approval or Parent Stockholder
Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange
require further approval of the shareholders of the Company or the
stockholders of Parent, as applicable, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to such approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given
no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to
this Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
