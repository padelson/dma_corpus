AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of August 22, 2014 (this "Agreement"),
among Roche Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Klee
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub") and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, and InterMune, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

  


 

  

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable the acquisition of the Company by
Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent will cause Merger Sub to
make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the
"Company Common Stock"), at a price per share of Company Common Stock of
$74.00 (such amount or, if the Offer is amended in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and a different amount per share is paid pursuant to the
Offer, such different amount, the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash,
without interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

  


 

  

WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub into the Company
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  


 

  

WHEREAS Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be governed by and effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and shall be consummated as soon
as practicable following acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock in
the Offer; and

  


 

  

WHEREAS Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


 

  

ARTICLE I

SECTION 1.01. The Offer. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five
business days after the date of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"). The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger
Sub to,

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer Conditions"). The initial

using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange
Act")). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any Offer Condition
or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, (i)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive, amend or modify the Minimum Tender
Condition or the Termination Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or
amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in any manner adverse to the

Section 1.01(a), terminate, or extend or otherwise amend or modify the
expiration date of, the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of
the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock or
(viii) provide any "subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11
of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (A) extend the Offer for one or more
consecutive increments of not more than five business days each (or for such
longer period as may be agreed by the Company), if at the scheduled expiration
date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as such
conditions shall have been satisfied or waived and (B) extend the Offer for
the minimum period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; provided
that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside
Date. In addition, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer
each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been
satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been
satisfied, Merger Sub shall have the right to (and, if requested by the
Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the
Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than five business
days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by the Company);
provided that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of
the Offer and, in any event, no more than three business days after the
Acceptance Time. The time at which Merger Sub first accepts for payment the
shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer is referred to as the
"Acceptance Time". The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration
date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance
with this Section 1.01(a)), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 8.01. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by
Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01,
Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to
the registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in this Section 1.01(a)
shall affect any termination rights set forth in Section 8.01.

(b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer

holders of Company Common Stock. The Company shall furnish to Parent and
Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the

false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and
to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform the Company and its counsel of any oral
comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments. Except with respect to any amendments filed after an Adverse
Recommendation Change, prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof
to the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide
the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version
thereof), and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by the Company or its counsel.

  


 

  

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  


 

  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or Merger Sub is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made.

SECTION 1.02. Company Actions. (a) Subject to Sections 5.03 and 8.04, the
Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the
"Transactions").

the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as
amended from time to time, the "Schedule 14D-9"), including a description of
the Company Board Recommendation, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to
the holders of Company Common Stock. The Schedule 14D-9 shall also contain the
notice of appraisal required to be delivered by the Company under Section
262(d) of the DGCL at the time the Company first files the Schedule 14D-9 with
the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to be set forth
in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform Parent and its counsel of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments. Except with respect to any
amendments filed after an Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection with
any disclosures made in compliance with Section 5.03, prior to the filing of
the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the
SEC or the dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the
Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response (including the proposed
final version thereof), and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of
the Company Board Recommendation (except to the extent that the Company Board
shall have withdrawn or modified the Company Board Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.03(e)).

  


 

  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date
and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together
with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer
files and all other information in the Company's possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to
Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Company's stockholders.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger
and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to

SECTION 2.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the

continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The
Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. Merger Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time, subject to the satisfaction or (to
the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the
party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of those conditions), or at
such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Merger Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Merger Closing Date".

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. Effective Time. Prior to the Merger Closing, Parent and the
Company shall prepare, and on the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger
(in any such case, the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
such Secretary of State or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time").

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. Effects of Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.05. Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. (a) At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as set forth in Exhibit B and, as so amended and
restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) The By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law, except
that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by the name of the
Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.06. Directors and Officers. (a) The parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

  


 

  

(b) The parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.07. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Company Common Stock
Held by Company Subsidiaries. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by any Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be converted
into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that
each such Company Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time as such Company Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) Conversion of Other Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.07(b) and
2.07(d), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than
Company Restricted Shares, the treatment of which is addressed in Section
6.04) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.08, without interest.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.07(c), but instead shall be canceled
and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided under
Section 262; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262, then the right of such holder to receive those rights under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.07(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.08. Payment of Merger Consideration. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration to former holders of Company Common Stock
(other than Company Restricted Shares). Parent shall take all steps necessary
to enable and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying
Agent, immediately after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for the
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash
pursuant to Section 2.07(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund").

  


 

  

(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than two business days after the Effective Time),
the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") which were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.07 (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are
customary and reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent
for cancelation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.07, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.08, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.07. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Treatment of Book-Entry Shares. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each holder of record, as
of the Effective Time of the Merger, of Book-Entry Shares in an amount of U.S.
dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled hereunder.

  


 

  

(d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II as a result
of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. After the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

  


 

  

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Merger Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(f) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such date become the property of the Surviving Corporation, subject
to the claims of any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment
of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article II.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. In no event, however, shall such investment or any such payment of
interest or income delay the receipt by former holders of Company Common Stock
of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders' rights
hereunder. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the
Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments.

  


 

  

(h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest.

  


 

  

(i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any former holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.09. Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will be adjusted in
connection with the Transaction in accordance with the terms of the
Indentures. The Company shall comply in all material respects with its
obligations under the Indentures that arise as a result of the execution,
delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions, including the delivery of any notices,
certificates and opinions required in connection with the Transactions.

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent the concept is

the Company Subsidiaries (a) has full power and authority necessary to enable
it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct
its business as presently conducted and (b) is duly qualified or licensed to

this Agreement and, assuming the representations and warranties set forth in

execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes
its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by

sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent and Merger Sub and this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction the provisions of Section 203
of the DGCL to the extent, if any, such section would otherwise be applicable
to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction and, to the

(b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit
from, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution,

would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.05. Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in
the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such document is
filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time
it is first published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Offer Documents will, at the time
such document is filed with the SEC, comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, except that no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
statements included or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.06. Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person is entitled to receive from the Company or any of the Company

Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of
its affiliates.

of Parent, threatened against Parent or any subsidiary of Parent that would

or any subsidiary of Parent that would reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.08. Ownership of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
is, or at any time during the last three years has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company within the meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL.
Prior to and as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
has taken, or authorized any officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys and other advisors or representatives ("Representatives")
of Parent or Merger Sub to take, or has knowledge that any Representatives of
Parent or Merger Sub have taken, any action that would cause either Parent or
Merger Sub to be deemed an "interested stockholder" within the meaning of
Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise render Section 251(h) of the DGCL
inapplicable to the Merger. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their
affiliates or associates (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) owns (within
the meaning of Section 203 of the DGCL) any Company Common Stock or holds any
rights to acquire any Company Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32

Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be,
to pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, to make payments
pursuant to Section 6.04 and to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.03. No Solicitation. (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their respective
Representatives to, (A) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Company Takeover Proposal or any

grant any waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any capital stock of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(and to the extent any such waiver or release is granted or such standstill or
similar agreement is not enforced, the standstill provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be correspondingly waived or
released or shall not be enforced, as applicable). It is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 5.03 by
any Representative of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries acting
with the authority of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be a breach
of this Section 5.03 by the Company.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to, immediately (i) cease all discussions and

Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to any Person within the last six months for
the purposes of evaluating a possible Company Takeover Proposal and (iii)
terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to a
possible Company Takeover Proposal.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.03(a) or
Section 5.03(b), at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (x) the Company may
contact the Person making any Company Takeover Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.03 solely to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof and (y) in response to a Company Takeover Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.03 and that the Company Board determines, in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company
Proposal (a "Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal"), the Company may (A)
furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such
Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement so long as the Company also provides
Parent, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information
is provided or made available to such Person, in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, any non-public information furnished to such
other Person which was not previously furnished to Parent, except to the
extent providing Parent with such information would violate applicable Law,
and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal, including
soliciting the making of a revised Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal.

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours after receipt thereof) notify Parent of any Company Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to
any Company Takeover Proposal, which notice shall include the identity of the
Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material
terms thereof. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including promptly informing
Parent of any change to the material terms or conditions thereof).

  


 

  

(e) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to
take any such action (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or permit the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other agreement relating to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
Section 5.03), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action.
Notwithstanding anything to contrary in the foregoing or any other provision
of this Agreement, but subject to Section 5.03(f), if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then (A) the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Company Proposal or an
Intervening Event, and (B) if the Company Board receives a Superior Company
Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g)
in accordance with Section 8.04(b).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(f) The Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g) unless (A) the Company
shall have provided Parent with written notice at least three business days
before taking that action setting forth the Company's intention to take such
action and containing (x) if such action is intended to be taken in response
to a Superior Company Proposal, a copy of the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which the transaction contemplated by such Superior
Company Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Person
making the Superior Company Proposal or (y) if such action is intended to be
taken in circumstances involving an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed
description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for
taking, such action, and (B) Parent does not make, within the foregoing three
business day period, a binding proposal to amend or modify this Agreement that
(x) in the case of any action intended to be taken in response to a Superior
Company Proposal, is in the good faith judgment of the Company Board at least
as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Company
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Company Proposal shall require
a new written notification from the Company and a new two business day period
under this Section 5.03(f)), or (y) in the case of any action intended to be
taken in circumstances involving an Intervening Event, obviates the need for
taking such action. During any such three or two business day period referred
to in the preceding sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to any
revisions proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement and the
Transactions.

  


 

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties or applicable Law; provided that any Adverse Recommendation Change will
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (it being understood
that (i) any "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii)
any disclosure of information to the Company's stockholders that describes the
Company's receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto and contains a statement that the Company Board
has not effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, shall be deemed to not be
an Adverse Recommendation Change).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a customary confidentiality
agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that such confidentiality agreement may omit or contain

Confidentiality Agreement and in such event the Confidentiality Agreement
shall be deemed correspondingly amended.

  


 

  

"Company Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or group relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of (A)

Company Board) of the assets (including capital stock of the Company
Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(B) 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the
Company or (ii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding
share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company that, if
consummated, would result in any Person or group (or the shareholders of any
Person) owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting
power of the capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity,
other than, in each case, the Transactions.

after the date hereof that was not known by the Company Board as of or prior
to the date hereof.

  


 

  

"Superior Company Proposal" means any bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal that if consummated would result in a Person or group (or the
shareholders of any Person) owning, directly or indirectly, (i) 50% or more of

surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or
such surviving entity or (ii) 50% or more (based on the fair market value
thereof, as determined by the Company Board) of the assets (including capital
stock of the Company Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (A) on terms which the Company Board determines, in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor, would
result in greater value to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and (B) that is reasonably
capable of being completed relative to the Transactions, taking into account
all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

Wherever the term "group" is used in this Section 5.03(g), it is used as
defined in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VI

  


 

  

Additional Agreements

  


 

  

SECTION 6.01. Approval of the Merger. (a) The Merger shall be governed by
Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time without a
stockholders meeting pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

  


 

  

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Except if prohibited by
any applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company
Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to Parent and to Parent's Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours (under the supervision of
appropriate personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal operation of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their
respective properties, books and records and Contracts and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to,
furnish, as promptly as practicable, to Parent all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate Parent's interactions with
the Company's CMOs, including, if requested by Parent, using commercially

incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with affording
such access or furnishing such information or facilitating such interactions
shall be reimbursed by Parent. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to afford access or furnish information to the extent (a) such
information is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party, (b) relating to the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board
(including any presentations or other materials prepared by or for the Company
Board) where the Company Board discussed the Transactions or any similar
transaction between the Company and any other Person or (c) the Company
determines in good faith that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, violate applicable Law or result in
significant antitrust risk for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries;
provided, in the case of clauses (a) and (c), that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements to afford
such access or furnish such information without breaching such confidentiality
agreement, jeopardizing such attorney-client privilege, violating applicable
Law or resulting in such antitrust risk, as applicable. All information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the
confidentiality letter agreement dated August 6, 2014 between the Company and
Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers and Consents from, the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and the taking of all

Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided
that the parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts
of Parent and Merger Sub shall not be deemed to include (A) divesting or
otherwise holding separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise),
or taking any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing)
with respect to any of its or the Company's or any of their respective
affiliates' businesses, assets or properties if such action is required in
connection with the completion of or as a result of the Transactions or (B)
entering into any settlement, undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or
agreement with any Governmental Entity if required in connection with the
completion of the Transactions (each action or condition described in clause
(A) or (B), a "Burdensome Condition"). In addition, the Company shall not
accept any of the conditions or take any of the actions set forth in the
proviso to the preceding sentence without Parent's prior written consent or
direction, in which case the Company shall accept any such conditions or take
any such actions as directed by Parent; provided that the Company shall not be
required to accept any such conditions or take any such actions that are not
conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall (A)
take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or this
Agreement and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the
Transactions and this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties' obligations under Section
6.03(a), and in furtherance thereof, Parent and the Company shall, in
consultation and cooperation with the other and as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than six business days after the date of this
Agreement), file (i) with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the
notification and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the
Offer, the Merger or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

any of the other Transactions and (ii) all appropriate filings required under
any competition, merger control, trade regulation, antitrust or similar Law of
any jurisdiction (collectively, the "Merger Control Laws"). Any such filings
shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or the
other applicable Merger Control Law, as the case may be. Each of Parent and
the Company shall (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR
Act or any other Merger Control Law, (ii) give the other party reasonable
prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other Governmental
Entity regarding the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and
permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other party in
connection with, any such filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or
requests, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not
participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions without the other party, (B) give the other
party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the
event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting or
engaging in any such conversation, keep such party apprised with respect
thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white
papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E)
furnish the other party with copies of all filings, submissions,
correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental
Entity's staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions and (iv) comply with any inquiry or
request from the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Any such additional information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or the other
applicable Merger Control Law, as the case may be. Parent agrees not to
extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under the HSR Act or any
other Merger Control Law or enter into any agreement with a Governmental
Entity to delay or not to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent may be withheld in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to Parent's obligations
set forth in this Section 6.03, Parent shall have the right to direct all
matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder
and Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition
clearances and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust or
competition clearances.

SECTION 6.04. Equity Awards. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
applicable Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such
other actions as may be required to effect the following, which shall occur by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the
applicable award:

  


 

  

(i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become fully exercisable and may be exercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time. To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time,
then at the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall be canceled, with
the holder of such Company Stock Option becoming entitled to receive an amount
in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration minus
(2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time;

  


 

  

(ii) at the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder of
such Company Restricted Stock Unit becoming entitled to receive an amount in
cash equal to (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with any applicable performance
conditions deemed to be achieved at maximum performance);

  


 

  

(iii) at the Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with
the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A)
the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of Company Restricted
Shares subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time (with any
applicable performance conditions deemed to be achieved at maximum
performance); and

  


 

  

(iv) (A) effective immediately after the Acceptance Time, (1) the then-current
purchase period under the Company ESPP shall end and each participant's
accumulated payroll deduction shall be used to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, (2) shares of
Company Common Stock purchased thereunder shall be converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.07(c) and (3) no further purchase period
shall commence under the Company ESPP following that date and (B) at the
Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company ESPP to terminate, and no
further purchase rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP
thereafter.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be subject to any
required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without interest. Each of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective subsidiaries shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any former holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and
Company Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company
Restricted Stock Units in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

  


 

  

(c) Subject to Section 6.04(b), promptly following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its subsidiaries to,
pay through its payroll system or otherwise all amounts payable pursuant to
Section 6.04(a) to the former holders of Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Shares, as applicable; provided,
however, that, to the extent any such amounts constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such amounts shall be paid
at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement or
Company Stock Plan that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code.

  


 

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) "Company ESPP" means the Company's Amended and Restated 2000 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan.

whether subject to time-based or performance-based vesting, payable in shares
of Company Common Stock or the value of which is determined with reference to
the value of shares of Company Common Stock, whether granted under a Company
Stock Plan or otherwise.

  


 

  

(iv) "Company Stock Option" means any option (other than rights under the
Company ESPP) to purchase Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock
Plan or otherwise.

  


 

  

(v) "Company Stock Plans" means the Company's Amended and Restated 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan, the Company's Amended and Restated 2000 Non-Employee

SECTION 6.05. Employee Matters. (a) From the Effective Time through December
31, 2015 (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to each individual who is employed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and continues to be so employed immediately following the Effective
Time (each, a "Company Employee") with, for so long as such individual
continues to be employed by Parent or its subsidiaries, salary, target
incentive opportunities (including the target grant date fair value of annual
equity-based compensation awards) and employee benefits that are, in the
aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to such Company Employee
by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Following the Continuation Period, the Company Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective subsidiaries (the "Surviving Corporation Plans") with
benefits comparable to those provided to employees of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective subsidiaries performing comparable roles and
functions in the same geographic area.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.05(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period the Company's
employment, severance, retention, termination and change in control plans,
policies, programs and agreements (including any change in control severance
agreement or other Company Benefit Agreement between the Company and any
Company Employee) maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries and
set forth in Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case,
as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments,
benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification,
other than any amendment or modification required to comply with applicable
Law; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing any equity awards granted by
Parent to Company Employees shall be on the standard terms and conditions
including vesting and treatment upon termination of employment as provided to
other employees of Parent and its subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(c) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or
any of its subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals (other than the accrual of
benefits under a defined benefit pension plan and sabbatical programs), each
Company Employee's service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is
recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

  


 

  

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions and
waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were
waived, satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents or
beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which
such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide Company Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in
satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to
the extent applicable under any such plan.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.07, the provisions of this
Section 6.05 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no Company Employee or any other Person (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9.07
with respect to Section 6.06), and no provision of this Section 6.05 shall
create such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement or any employee program or any plan or arrangement of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall be construed as the
establishment or modification of or an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan,
Company Benefit Agreement or plan, program, policy, agreement, arrangement or
understanding of Parent or its affiliates, and nothing herein shall obligate
Parent or any of its affiliates to maintain any particular Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Arrangement.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.06. Indemnification. (a) All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee
or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan)
of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company
Charter, the Company By-laws, the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof
(i) shall survive the Merger, (ii) shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any such
Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iii) shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure
that the Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing
obligations.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting Section 6.06(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the acceptance for
payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including
as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii)
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon
receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Proceeding. None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for
which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder, in each
case at its own expense; provided that, absent an actual or potential conflict
of interest, in which case such Indemnified Party shall control and appoint
its own lead counsel at Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's expense, as
applicable, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to control
and appoint lead counsel for such defense. Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's obligations under this Section 6.06(b) shall continue in full
force and effect for the period beginning upon the acceptance for payment of,
and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and ending six years from the Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions) for the period beginning upon the
acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and ending six years from the
Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party and containing terms
(including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including
with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the
aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement (the "Existing DandO Policies"); provided, however,
that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such "tail" insurance policies
for any such year shall not exceed the maximum aggregate annual premium
contemplated by the second succeeding sentence. If such "tail" insurance
policies have been obtained by the Company, Parent shall cause such "tail"
insurance policies to be maintained in full force and effect, for their full
term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance
policies, then, for the period beginning upon the acceptance for payment of,
and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and ending six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
in effect the Existing DandO Policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions); provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such
insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium payable by the
Company for coverage for its current fiscal year under the Existing DandO
Policies (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in
Section 6.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter); provided further that if
the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous
policy available for an annual premium equal to such amount; and provided
further that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of a
reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms (including
with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect
to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no
less favorable to any Indemnified Party.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) In the event that (i) the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its
properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any of its
successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.

  


 

  

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.06 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section
6.06 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which each
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.06.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.07. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.02,
Section 6.06, this Section 6.07 and Section 6.09, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g);

  


 

  

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); or

  


 

  

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is
publicly proposed or announced or the making or existence of a Company
Takeover Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known and such Company
Takeover Proposal is not publicly withdrawn (x) in the case of this Agreement
being subsequently terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c), prior to the time
of the breach or failure to perform giving rise to such termination or (y) in
the case of this Agreement being subsequently terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i), prior to the date that is two business days prior to the final
expiration date of the Offer, (B) after such proposal becomes publicly known,
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c), (C) in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), at the final expiration date
of the Offer, the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (b), (i) and (ii) of
Exhibit A shall have been satisfied, but the Minimum Tender Condition shall
not have been satisfied and (D) within 9 months of such termination the
Company enters into a definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates, the
transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal,

  


 

  

then, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $266,000,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee"). For purposes of this Section 6.07(b), the term "Company
Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term, except that
all references to 20% in the definition thereof shall be deemed references to
50%. Any fee due under this Section 6.07(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of
same-day funds to an account designated by Parent, (1) in the case of clause
(i) above, prior to or simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement,
(2) in the case of clause (ii) above, within two business days after the date
of such termination of this Agreement and (3) in the case of clause (iii)
above, within two business days after the earlier of (x) the date of the entry
into such definitive agreement or (y) the date of the consummation of such
Company Takeover Proposal. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more
than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

  


 

  

(c) Acceptance by Parent of the fee due under Section 6.07(b)(i) shall
constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of this
Agreement under Section 8.01(g). Except in the case of fraud, payment of the
Company Termination Fee described in this Section 6.07 shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective current, former or future
Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of the Company Termination
Fee, none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective current, former or future Representatives shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
6.07 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount
due to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.07, it shall also pay any costs and
expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with a legal action to
enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such
amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or
expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date
such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.08. Public Announcements. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release or other public statements with respect to the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange and except as
specifically permitted or required by Section 5.03. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be
in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.09. Transfer Taxes. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by either Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and
Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.10. Stockholder Litigation. Prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall promptly advise
Parent of any Proceeding commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened by a stockholder against the Company or its directors relating to
any Transaction and shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed
regarding any such Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such Proceeding and shall
give due consideration to Parent's views with respect thereto; provided,
however, that the Company shall control such defense and this Section 6.10
shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense; and provided further,
that no settlement of any such Proceeding shall be agreed to without Parent's
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.11. Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the scheduled expiration of the
Offer, the Company (acting through the Company Board and its Compensation
Committee) shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt
under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement that has been,
or after the date of this Agreement will be, entered into by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers,
employees or other service providers of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the non-
exclusive safe harbor provisions of such rule. Promptly upon Parent or any of
its affiliates entering into any such arrangement with any current or future
director, officer, employee or other service provider of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, Parent will provide to the Company any and all
information concerning such arrangements as may be needed by the Company to
comply with this Section 6.11.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

SECTION 6.12. Rule 16b-3 Matters. The Company shall take all reasonable steps
as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.13. Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance. Parent shall
cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to comply with
all of its respective obligations under this Agreement and Merger Sub shall
not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

  


 

  

(i) prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Acceptance Time has not occurred on

if, on the Outside Date, any of the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (b),
(i) (solely, in the case of clause (i), relating to a Legal Restraint in
respect of any Merger Control Laws in the U.S. or in any of the jurisdictions
set forth in Schedule 1 of Exhibit A) or (ii) of Exhibit A shall not have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefits thereof, then, at the written request of either
Parent or the Company to the other party, the Outside Date shall be extended
by a period of 150 calendar days and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to a party if the failure

non-appealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (ii) shall have complied with its obligations under
Section 6.03 in respect of any such Legal Restraint;

  


 

  

(c) by Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company breaches or fails
to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of the conditions set forth in clause (iii) or (iv) of Exhibit A and
(ii) cannot be or has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) 30 days after
the giving of written notice to the Company of such breach and (y) the Outside
Date (provided that Parent and Merger Sub are not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement);

  


 

  

(d) by Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) an Adverse Recommendation
Change has occurred or (ii) there shall have been an intentional and material

52  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(e) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Time, if Merger Sub shall have
terminated the Offer prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may
be extended and re-extended in accordance with Section 1.01(a)), other than in
accordance with this Agreement;

  


 

  

(f) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Time, if Parent or Merger Sub
breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement (without regard to any qualifications or
exceptions contained therein as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse
Effect), which breach or failure to perform (i) had or would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect and (ii) has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) 30 days after
the giving of written notice to Parent or Merger Sub of such breach and (y)
the Outside Date (provided that the Company is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); or

  


 

  

(g) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Time, in accordance with Section
8.04(b).

termination to the other party in accordance with Section 9.02.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand (except to the extent that such termination
results from the willful and material breach by a party of any representation,
warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement, in which case such party
shall be liable to the other party for damages which shall include, in the
case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, liability to the Company for lost
stockholder premium), other than Section 1.02(c), Section 3.19, Section 4.06,
the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.07, this Section 8.02 and Article
IX, which provisions shall survive such termination.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.03. Amendment; Extension; Waiver. (a) At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties may (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (iii) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) after the Acceptance Time, termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(a) and any amendments to this Agreement shall
require, in addition to the consent of Parent and Merger Sub, the consent of
the Company Board and, at the time of such consent, either (x) a majority of
the directors on the Company Board were directors on the Company Board on the
date hereof or were nominated or designated to be directors by a majority of
the directors on the Company Board on the date hereof (such directors,
"Continuing Directors") or (y) if the Continuing Directors constitute a
minority of the Board of Directors, each Continuing Director approves such
termination or amendment and (B) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement
after the Effective Time.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  


 

  

SECTION 8.04. Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. (a) A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of this
Agreement or an extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee of its Board of Directors. Termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01 shall not require the approval of the stockholders of
the Company.

  


 

  

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g) only
if (i) the Company Board has received a Superior Company Proposal, (ii) the
Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
Section 5.03(f) and (iii) the Company has paid, or simultaneously with the
termination of this Agreement pays, the fee due under Section 6.07 that is
payable if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(g).

References to "this Agreement" shall include the Company Disclosure Letter.
All Exhibits annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in
and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any terms
used in the Company Disclosure Letter, any Exhibit or any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto but not otherwise defined therein
shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. The definitions of terms
herein shall apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms
defined. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning as the word "shall". The words "include",
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase
"without limitation". The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall
mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase
shall not mean simply "if". The word "or" shall not be exclusive. The phrase
"date hereof" or "date of this Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to August
22, 2014. Unless the context requires otherwise (i) any definition of or
reference to any Contract, instrument or other document or any Law herein
shall be construed as referring to such Contract, instrument or other document
or Law as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, but

SECTION 9.05. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

representations and warranties contained in Article III, neither the Company
nor any Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions. Except in the case of
fraud, neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent's or
Merger Sub's use of, any such information, including any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent
or Merger Sub in certain "data rooms" or management presentations in
expectation of the Transactions, unless and then only to the extent that any
such information is expressly included in a representation or warranty
contained in Article III.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV, the
Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person on

respect to any other information made available to the Company in connection
with the Transactions.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.08. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign,
in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.10. Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction. (a) The parties acknowledge
and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any
other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 9.10(b),
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific
enforcement shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger
Sub to cause the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without such right, none of the parties would have entered
into this Agreement. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any
Proceeding, in each case in accordance with Section 9.10(b), to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of
time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus 20 business days or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Proceeding, as the case may be.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such
court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such
Proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in such court. Each of the
parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be
unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) in
the event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of process in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by U.S.
registered mail to such party's respective address set forth in Section 9.02
(provided that nothing in this Section 9.10(b) shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or shall
limit the notice obligations under Section 9.02) and (iv) agrees that it will
not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions in any court other than the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or
Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties hereto agree that
a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law; provided, however, that nothing in the foregoing shall
restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any
appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the

Exhibit A

  

to

  

Agreement and Plan of Merger

  

  

Offer Conditions

  


 

  


 

  

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Sub's obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer if (a) there
shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
of the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding for the
avoidance of doubt all shares of Company Common Stock delivered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery instructions for which certificates have not yet been
delivered) which would represent at least a majority of the Fully Diluted
Shares (the "Minimum Tender Condition") or (b) any waiting period (or
extension thereof) under the HSR Act or any waiting period (or extension
thereof) or clearance under any other Merger Control Law in any of the
jurisdictions set forth in Schedule 1 hereto (each, a "Specified Merger
Control Law") applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger shall have neither
expired nor been terminated nor granted or shall have expired, been terminated
or granted with the imposition of a Burdensome Condition. The term "Fully
Diluted Shares" means all outstanding securities entitled generally to vote in
the election of directors of the Company on a fully diluted basis, whether or
not then vested and after giving effect to the exercise, conversion or
exchange of all options, rights and securities exercisable, convertible or
exchangeable into such voting securities. Furthermore, notwithstanding any
other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required
to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for if, at the expiration
of the Offer, any of the following conditions exists:

  


 

  

(i) there shall be any Legal Restraint in effect preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or imposing a Burdensome Condition;

  


 

  

(ii) there shall be instituted or pending any action or Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity in the U.S. or in any of the jurisdictions set forth in
Schedule 1 hereto, in each case acting pursuant to or implementing any Merger
Control Law (A) challenging or seeking to make illegal, to delay materially or
otherwise to prevent or prohibit the making of the Offer or the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger or (B) seeking to impose a Burdensome Condition;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

(iii) (A) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Article
III (other than those set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.04, 3.08(a), 3.19
and 3.20) shall not be true and correct at such time, except to the extent
such representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in
which case on and as of such specified date), other than for such failures to
be true and correct that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of this condition, without regard to any
qualifications or exceptions contained therein as to "materiality" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect"), (B) any representation and warranty of the Company
set forth in Section 3.02 (other than 3.02(e)) shall not be true and correct
other than in de minimis respects at such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in which
case on and as of such specified date), (C) any representation and warranty of
the Company set forth in Section 3.08(a) shall not be true and correct in all
respects at such time; and (D) any representation and warranty of the Company
set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02(e), 3.04, 3.19 and 3.20 shall not be true and
correct in all material respects at such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in which
case on and as of such specified date);

  


 

  

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects all
obligations to be performed by it as of such time under this Agreement;

  


 

  

(v) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed by
an executive officer of the Company, dated as of the date on which the Offer
expires, certifying that the Offer Conditions specified in the preceding
paragraphs (iii) and (iv) do not exist; or

  


 

  

(vi) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms
(the "Termination Condition").

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition). The
failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.
