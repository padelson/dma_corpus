result of the entering into of this Agreement shall not be considered a breach
of this Section 3.4(b)(v); 
---|---|--- 
 



28 provided, however, that notwithstanding any provisions of Sections 3.4(a)(i)
or (ii) or this Section 3.4(b), Pure and its Representatives may:



     | (vi) | enter into, or participate in, any discussions or

fide_ Acquisition Proposal and the board of directors of Pure determines in
good faith: (1) that is not subject to a financing condition and the funds or
other consideration necessary for the consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal are available or, as demonstrated to the board of directors of Pure,
acting in good faith, that adequate financing arrangements will be in place
to ensure that the third party will have the funds necessary for the
consummation of the Acquisition Proposal, if any; (2) that is not subject to
any due diligence or access condition, other than to permit access to the
books, records or personnel of Pure which is not more extensive than that
which would customarily be provided for confirmatory due diligence purposes;
(3) that the board of directors of Pure and any relevant committee thereof
has determined in good faith (after receipt of advice from a financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being completed in
accordance with its terms within a time frame that is reasonable in the
circumstances taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal; and (4) in respect of which the board of directors of Pure has
determined in good faith (after the receipt of advice from its legal counsel
in respect of (I) below, and its financial advisors in respect of (II) below,
in each case as reflected in the minutes of the board of directors), that (I)
failure to recommend such Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duty under Applicable Laws; and (II) such Acquisition Proposal if
consummated in accordance with its terms, would reasonably be expected to
result in a transaction financially superior for the Pure Shareholders than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in its current form (including
taking into account any modifications to this Agreement proposed by Purchaser
as contemplated by Section 3.4(d)) (a "Superior Proposal"); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | prior to furnishing such information to or entering into or

third party, Pure provides prompt notice to Purchaser to the effect that it
is furnishing information to or entering into or participating in discussions
or negotiations with such Person or entity and provides to Purchaser a copy of

previously provided to Purchaser, copies of all information provided to such
third party concurrently with the provision of such information to such third

     | (viii) | accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to
implement a Superior Proposal from a third party and, in connection therewith,
withdraw any approval or recommendation contemplated by Section 3.4(b)(ii),
but only if prior to such acceptance, recommendation, approval or
implementation, (A) the board of directors of Pure shall have concluded in
good faith, after considering all proposals to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 3.4(d) and after
receiving the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, as
reflected in minutes of the board of directors of Pure, that such
third partys Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and the failure to
take such action is inconsistent with the discharge of the fiduciary duties of
the Pure board of directors under Applicable Laws, (B) Pure complies with its
obligations set out in Section 3.4(d), and (C) Pure terminates this Agreement
in accordance with Section 8.1(d) and concurrently therewith pays the

---|---|--- 
 



   (c) | Pure shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt
by Pure) notify Purchaser (at first orally and then in writing) of any
Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment thereto) or any request for non-public
information relating to Pure, its assets, or any amendments to the foregoing
received by Pure. Such notice shall include a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal (and any amendment thereto) received by Pure or, if no
written Acquisition Proposal has been received, a description of the material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making any inquiry,
proposal, offer or request (to the extent then known by Pure). Pure shall
also provide such further and other details of the Acquisition Proposal or any
amendment thereto as Purchaser may reasonably request (to the extent then
known by Pure). Pure shall keep Purchaser fully informed of the status,
including any change to material terms, of any Acquisition Proposal or any
amendment thereto, shall respond promptly to all reasonable inquiries by
Purchaser with respect thereto, and shall provide to Purchaser copies of
all material correspondence and other written material sent to or provided to
Pure by any Person in connection with such inquiry, proposal, offer or request
or sent or provided by Pure to any Person in connection with such inquiry,
proposal, offer or request.

   (d) |

Following receipt of a Superior Proposal, Pure shall give Purchaser, orally
and in writing, at least three Business Days advance notice of any
decision by its board of directors to accept, recommend, approve or enter
into an agreement to implement a Superior Proposal, which notice shall: (i)
confirm that the board of directors of Pure has determined that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) identify the third
party making the Superior Proposal; (iii) confirm that the entering into of a
definitive agreement to implement such Superior Proposal is not subject to any
due diligence or access condition; and (iv) confirm that a definitive
agreement to implement such Superior Proposal has been settled between Pure
and such third party in all material respects, and Pure will concurrently
provide a true and complete copy thereof and, will thereafter promptly
provide any amendments thereto, to Purchaser. During the three Business Day
period commencing on the delivery of such notice, Pure agrees not to accept,
recommend, approve or enter into any definitive agreement to implement
such Superior Proposal

Business Day period, Pure shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Purchaser and its financial and
legal advisors to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Arrangement that would result in the Arrangement, as
amended, being equal or superior from a financial point of view to the Pure
Securityholders than the Superior Proposal. In the event Purchaser confirms in
writing its commitment to amend this Agreement to provide a transaction
financially equivalent or superior for the Pure Shareholders than the
Superior Proposal and so advises the board of directors of Pure prior to the
expiry of such three Business Day period, the board of directors of Pure shall
not accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such
Superior Proposal and shall not withdraw, redefine, modify or change its
recommendation in respect of the Arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
and for greater certainty, Purchaser shall have no obligation to make or
negotiate any changes to this Agreement in the event that Pure is in receipt
of a Superior Proposal. Pure acknowledges that each successive material
modification of any Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Superior Proposal
for purposes of this Section 3.4(d). 
---|--- 



   (e) | The board of directors of Pure shall reaffirm its recommendation
of the Arrangement by news release promptly, and in any event within three
Business Days of being requested to do so by Purchaser (or in the event that
the Pure Meeting to approve the Arrangement is scheduled to occur within such
three Business Day period, prior to the scheduled date of such meeting), in
the event that: (i) any Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced unless the
board of directors of Pure has determined that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal in accordance with this Section 3.4; or (ii)
the Parties have entered into an amended agreement pursuant to Section 3.4(d)
that results in any Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal. 
---|--- 



   (f) | Purchaser agrees that all information that may be provided to it
by Pure with respect to any Superior Proposal pursuant to this Section 3.4
shall be treated as if it were "Confidential Information" as that term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement and such information shall not be
disclosed or used except in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement or
in order to enforce its rights under this Agreement in legal proceedings. 
---|--- 



   (g) | Each Party shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Section 3.4. Pure shall be responsible for any breach of
this Section 3.4 by its Representatives. 
---|--- 



   3.5 | Access to Information 
---|--- 



   (a) | From and after the Agreement Date until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, Pure shall, subject to
compliance with Applicable Laws, the Confidentiality Agreement and the terms
of any Contracts (in which circumstances Pure will make commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver thereof) and upon reasonable notice,
provide Purchaser and its Representatives access, during normal business
hours and at such other time or times as Purchaser may reasonably request, to
its premises (including field offices and sites), books, Contracts, Returns,
records, properties, employees and management personnel and shall
furnish promptly to Purchaser all information concerning its business,
properties, operations and personnel as Purchaser may reasonably request in
order to permit Purchaser to be in a position to expeditiously and efficiently
integrate the business and operations of Pure with those of Purchaser
immediately upon but not prior to the Effective Date, provided that Pures
compliance with any request under this Section 3.5(a) shall not unduly
interfere with the conduct of Pures business. 
---|--- 
 



31 provided by Pure to Purchaser (or any of its Representatives) pursuant to this
Section 3.5 shall be considered to be "Confidential Information" for purposes
of the Confidentiality Agreement and shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

case, has had or, if the Arrangement was consummated, would result in a
material adverse change or have a material adverse effect in respect of Pure
or would materially delay or impede the ability of the Parties to complete the
Arrangement;

herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) result in
the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant or condition to be
complied with or satisfied by any Party hereunder; provided, however, that no
such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the

thereof, then the Party for whose benefit the condition precedent is provided
may, in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or equity, terminate
this Agreement as provided for in Section 8.1(b)(iii), provided that, prior
to the filing of the Articles of Arrangement, the Party intending to rely
thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party specifying in
reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and warranties
or other matters that the Party delivering such notice is asserting as the
basis for the non-fulfillment of the applicable condition or conditions
precedent and shall provide in such notice that the other Party shall be
entitled to cure any breach of a covenant or representation and warranty or
other matters within five Business Days after receipt of such notice (except
that no cure period shall be provided for a breach that, by its nature,
cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure period extend beyond the
Outside Date). More than one such notice may be delivered by a Party.

ARTICLE 6 

AGREEMENT AS TO DAMAGES



   6.1 | Purchaser Damages 
---|--- 

If at any time after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior
to the termination of this Agreement:



   (a) | the board of directors of Pure: (i) fails to make any of the
recommendations or determinations required to be made by it in Section 2.2(c);
(ii) withdraws, or modifies, changes or qualifies in a manner adverse to
Purchaser any of the recommendations or determinations required to be made by
it in Section 2.2(c); (iii) fails to publicly reaffirm any of its
recommendations or determinations referred to in Section 2.2(c) in the manner
and within the time period set out in Section 3.4(e); or (iv) resolves or
publicly proposes to do any of the foregoing; 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal (or a _bona fide_ intention to
make one) is publicly announced, proposed, offered or made to Pure, the Pure
Shareholders or the board of directors of Pure prior to the date of the Pure
Meeting, and the Pure Shareholders do not approve the Arrangement Resolution
and such Acquisition Proposal, an amended version thereof or any other
Acquisition Proposal is consummated within twelve months of the date of
termination of this Agreement; 
---|--- 



   (c) | the board of directors of Pure (or any committee thereof)
accepts, recommends, approves, agrees to, endorses or enters into, or proposes
publicly to accept, recommend, approve, agree to, endorse or enter into an
agreement to implement a Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 3.4; 
---|--- 



   (d) | Pure breaches any of the covenants made by it in this Agreement,
which breach, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse change, or to have a material
adverse effect, in respect of Pure or would or would reasonably be expected to
materially delay, impede or prevent the consummation of the Arrangement,
provided that Purchaser shall have given Pure written notice of, and five
Business Days to cure, any such breach and such breach shall not have been
cured (except that no cure period shall be provided for a breach that, by its
nature, cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure period extend beyond
the Outside Date); or 
---|--- 



   (e) | Pure breaches any of the representations or warranties made by it
in this Agreement, which breach, individually or in the aggregate, would or
would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change, or to
have a material adverse effect, in respect of Pure or would or would
reasonably be expected to materially delay, impede or prevent the consummation
of the Arrangement, provided that Purchaser shall have given Pure written
notice of, and five Business Days to cure, any such breach and such breach
shall not have been cured (except that no cure period shall be provided for a
breach that, by its nature, cannot be cured and, in no event, shall any cure
period extend beyond the Outside Date), 
---|--- 
 



50 (each of the above hereinafter referred to as a "Purchaser Damages Event")
Pure shall, in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1, pay to Purchaser the Purchaser Termination Fee, as liquidated
damages, in immediately available funds, to an account designated by
Purchaser, within five Business Days after the occurrence of the first
Purchaser Damages Event, and after the occurrence of such Purchaser Damages
Event, but prior to payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee, Pure shall be
deemed to hold an amount equal to the Purchaser Termination Fee in trust for
Purchaser. Pure shall only be obligated to pay one Purchaser Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 6.1.

For greater certainty, provided that an event under Section 6.1 has not
occurred, the occurrence of other events, including, but not limited to, the
failure to satisfy the mutual conditions to close relating to HSR Approval
under Section 5.1(e), and other Regulatory Approvals under Section 5.1(f),
shall not result in a Purchaser Damages Event, unless the failure to satisfy
such conditions was a result of a breach of any of the covenants or
representations made by Pure in this Agreement, which breach, individually or
in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to be the cause of the
non-satisfaction of such conditions such that a Purchaser Damages Event would
thereby have occurred pursuant to Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.1(e), as
applicable.



   6.2 | Liquidated Damages and Specific Performance 
---|--- 

Solely in the event of a (x) termination by Pure pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or
(y) termination by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(c), each of Purchaser and
Pure acknowledges that the payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee is a
payment of liquidated damages and represents a genuine pre-estimate of the
damages that Purchaser will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving
rise to such termination of this Agreement and is not a penalty. Pure
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages payable by it are excessive or punitive. For greater
certainty, Purchaser and Pure agree that receipt of the Purchaser Termination
Fee is the sole monetary remedy of Purchaser hereunder solely in the event of
a (x) termination by Pure pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or (y) termination by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(c). Nothing in this Article 6 shall
preclude Purchaser or Pure from (x) seeking and obtaining injunctive relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants of the other Party
set out in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or specific
performance of any of such covenants of the other Party, without the necessity
of posting bond or security in connection therewith, or (y) seeking a remedy
for any willful breach or fraud.

 

ARTICLE 7

AMENDMENT



   7.1 | Amendment 
---|--- 

This Agreement may, at any time and from time to time before or after the
holding of the Pure Meeting, be amended by written agreement of the Parties
without, subject to Applicable Laws, further notice to, or authorization from,
their respective securityholders and any such amendment may, without
limitation:



   (a) | change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts
of Purchaser or Pure hereunder; 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | waive any inaccuracies in, or modify, any representation or
warranty contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; 
---|--- 
 



   (c) | waive compliance with, or modify, any of the covenants contained
herein and waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of Purchaser
or Pure hereunder; or  
---|--- 
 



51 precedent set out herein, 
---|--- 

provided that no such amendment reduces or adversely affects the consideration
to be received by the Pure Shareholders without approval by the Pure
Shareholders given in the same manner as required for the approval of the
Arrangement.

ARTICLE 8

TERMINATION



   8.1 | Termination 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Date:



   (a) | by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Pure; 
---|--- 



   (b) | by either Purchaser or Pure, provided that a Purchaser Damages
Event has not occurred: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | if the Pure Shareholder Approval is not obtained at the Pure
Meeting; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior
to the Outside Date, except that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
fulfill any of its obligations has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | as provided in Section 5.4(b), provided that the failure
to satisfy the particular condition precedent being relied upon as a basis for
termination of this Agreement did not occur as a result of a breach by the
Party seeking to rely on the condition precedent of any of its covenants or
obligations under the Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



   (c) | by Purchaser upon the occurrence of a Purchaser Damages Event, as
provided in Section 6.1; or 
---|--- 
 



   (d) | by Pure upon the occurrence of a Purchaser Damages Event, as set
out in Section 6.1(c), and the payment by Pure to Purchaser of the Purchaser
Termination Fee specified in Section 6.1, provided however that Pure has
complied with its obligations set out in Section 3.4. 
---|--- 

In the event of the termination of this Agreement in the circumstances set out
in this Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and be of no
further force or effect and no Party shall have any liability or further
obligation to the other hereunder except (x) with respect to the obligations
set out in any of Section 4.3, Article 6, Article 9 and Article 10, all of
which shall survive such termination, and (y) nothing herein shall relieve
any Party from liability for any willful breach or fraud. For greater
certainty, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article 8 shall
not affect the rights or obligations of any Party under the Confidentiality
Agreement and such confidentiality agreement shall remain in full force and
effect, subject to any further agreement of the Parties.

---|--- 
 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns; provided that this Agreement may
not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other
Party, except that Purchaser may assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its wholly-owned direct
or indirect subsidiaries but none of any such assignments shall (a) relieve
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder, (b) impede, delay or prevent the
receipt of any Regulatory Approvals or the satisfaction of any other
conditions precedent set forth in Article 5, or (c) impede, delay or prevent
the consummation of the Arrangement.



   10.2 | Disclosure 
---|--- 

Each Party shall receive the prior consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
of the other Party prior to issuing or permitting any of its directors,
officers, employees or agents to issue, any news release or other written
statement with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement; provided, that a
Party may, without obtaining the other Parties consent make public
announcements containing information consistent with any prior press releases
or public statements made by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
either Party is required by Applicable Laws, or the rules of any stock
exchange on which any of its securities may be listed, to make any disclosure
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, such disclosure may be made, but that Party shall make commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party as to the nature and
wording of such disclosure prior to it being made.

 



   10.3 | Costs 
---|--- 

Except as expressly set out herein, each Party covenants and agrees to bear
its own costs and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Purchaser shall be responsible for any filing fees payable in
respect of any filings made under the HSR Act in regards to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



54 ---|--- 

If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Agreement
is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any
jurisdiction, such provision or provisions (or part or parts thereof) shall
be, and shall be conclusively deemed to be, as to such jurisdiction,
severable from the balance of this Agreement and:



   (a) | the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired by
the severance of the provisions (or parts thereof) so severed; and 
---|--- 



   (b) | the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any provision
(or part thereof) of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not affect or
impair such provision (or part thereof) or any other provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. 
---|--- 



   10.5 | Further Assurances 
---|--- 

Each Party hereto shall, from time to time and at all times hereafter, at the
request of the other Parties, but without further consideration, do all such

instruments as the other Parties may reasonably request in order to fully
perform and carry out the terms and intent of this Agreement.

---|--- 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws

Province of Alberta in respect of all disputes arising under or in relation
to this Agreement.



   10.8 | Injunctive Relief 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be
entitled to equitable remedies, including specific performance, a restraining
order and interlocutory, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being waived. Such remedies
will not be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will
be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to each of the
Parties.



   10.9 | Waiver 
---|--- 

No waiver by a Party shall be effective unless it is set out in a written
instrument signed by such Party and any waiver shall affect only the matter,
and the occurrence thereof, specifically identified in the applicable written
instrument and shall not extend to any other matter or occurrence.

 



55 ---|--- 
 

The provisions of Sections 2.9 and 3.1(g)(i)-(ii) are intended for the benefit
of all present and former directors and officers of Pure, as and to the
extent applicable in accordance with their terms, and shall be enforceable by
each of such Persons and his or her heirs, executors, administrators and other
legal representatives and the provisions of Section 3.2(k) are intended for
the benefit of Purchaser and all present and former directors and officers of
Purchaser, as and to the extent applicable in accordance with their terms, and

executors, administrators and other legal representatives (collectively, the
"Third Party Beneficiaries") and each of Purchaser and Pure, as applicable,
shall hold the rights and benefits of Sections 2.9, 3.1(g)(i)-(ii) and 3.2(k)

Purchaser and Pure hereby accepts such trust and agrees to hold the benefit of
and enforce performance of such covenants on behalf of the Third Party
Beneficiaries, and in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights that the Third Party Beneficiaries may have by contract or otherwise.
Except as expressly provided in this Section 10.10, nothing in this Agreement
shall create or be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Person not a party to this Agreement.



   10.11 | Counterparts 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and by facsimile or portable
document format (PDF), each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
