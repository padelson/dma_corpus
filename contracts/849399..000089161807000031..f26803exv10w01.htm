repayment of accrued interest and then outstanding principal under such promissory notes before
being distributed to such holder. The Company shall take all actions that may be reasonably
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Acquiror (or its assignee) is entitled

Acquiror without payment to such holder (other than payment of the original purchase price of any
Unvested Company Shares converted into Unvested Cash upon exercise of the applicable right by
