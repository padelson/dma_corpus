Pennsylvania corporation (" _Parent_ "), LV Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
determined that it is fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and the holders of the Class A common stock of the Company, par value
$.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), and the holders of each series of
preferred stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the " _Preferred
Stock_ "), to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, providing
for the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
with the Company as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board and the respective boards of directors of Parent
and Merger Sub have approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and have approved and declared
advisable this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as an express
condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,

this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
Surviving Corporation and the separate corporate existence of the Company,
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

      
 

 



 

1.2. Closing. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the Company

Business Day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to
be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but

1.3. Effective Time. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by causing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall
make all other filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger, if any. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with, and accepted for
record by, the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time or date as the parties hereto
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with
applicable Law (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

2.1. The Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended and restated in the Merger to be identical to that
set forth on Annex B attached hereto (the " _Charter_ ") and, as so amended
and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (subject to Section 6.14).

 



 

2.2. The Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the bylaws of the

therein and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (subject
to Section 6.14).

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

 



 

3.1. Directors. The parties hereto shall take, and cause to be taken, all
actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective successors
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 



      
 

 



 

3.2. Officers. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office until their respective successors shall have

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates_

 



 

4.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share (a " _Share_ " and, collectively, "
_Shares_ ") of Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent,
and in each case not held on behalf of a third party, (ii) Dissenting Shares
(as defined below), and (iii) Shares held by the Company in treasury or held
by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and not held
on behalf of a third party (each Share referred to in clauses (i) through
(iii) above being an " _Excluded Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to (x) the applicable Per Share Closing Consideration
and (y) any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(iv)(A)(2)
or Section 4.1(b)(iv)(B), as applicable (collectively, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
formerly representing any Shares and any non-certificated Shares represented
by book-entry (a " _Book Entry Share_ ") (in each case, other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
and shall represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration per Share multiplied by the number of such Shares formerly
represented thereby, without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, the number
of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time does
not impact the calculation or amount of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) _Estimates at Closing_. Not less than five Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a good-faith
written estimate (the " _Pre-Closing Statement_ ") which shall set forth, in
each case as of 12:00 midnight Las Vegas time on the Closing Date, (A) the
estimated Net Working Capital Variance (" _Estimated Net Working Capital
Variance_ "), which shall include an estimate of Net Working Capital, (B) the
estimated amount of Indebtedness outstanding (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ ")
and (C) the estimated amount of Net Operating Cash (" _Estimated Net Operating
Cash_ "), which shall include an estimate of Restricted Cash, together with
such schedules and data with respect to the determination thereof as may be
appropriate to support the calculations set forth in the Pre-Closing
Statement. The Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared with the same
accounting principles, practices,

 



      
 

 



 

methodologies and policies set forth on and applied in the preparation of the
sample calculation of the aggregate Merger Consideration as of March 31, 2015
attached as Annex C to this Agreement (the " _Sample Calculation_ ").

 



 

(ii) _Closing Statement._ As promptly as practicable, but in any case no later
than 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be prepared (with
the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies set
forth on and applied in the preparation of the Sample Calculation) and
delivered to the Stockholder Representative a closing statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth ParentÂ’s calculation, in each case as of
12:00 midnight Las Vegas time on the Closing Date, of (A) the Net Working
Capital Variance (" _Closing Net Working Capital Variance_ "), which shall
include ParentÂ’s calculation of Net Working Capital, (B) the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding (" _Closing Indebtedness_ ") and (C) the amount of
Net Operating Cash (" _Closing Net Operating Cash_ "), which shall include
ParentÂ’s calculation of Restricted Cash, together with such schedules and data
with respect to the determination thereof as may be appropriate to support the
calculations set forth in the Closing Statement.

 



 

(iii) _Disputes_.

 



 

(A) If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement or
ParentÂ’s calculation of any amounts on the Closing Statement, the Stockholder
Representative may, within 30 days after receipt by the Stockholder
Representative of the Closing Statement and such calculations, deliver a
written notice to Parent reasonably detailing such disagreement and setting
forth the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s calculation of such disputed amount(s).
Any such notice shall specify all items or amounts with which the Stockholder
Representative disagrees, and the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed
to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing
Statement, which agreement shall be final and binding upon, and non-appealable
by, the Stockholder Representative, holders of Shares and Parent with respect
to such undisputed amounts.

 



 

(B) In connection with the determination of Closing Net Working Capital
Variance, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net Operating Cash, from the
Closing Date through the final calculation of the Merger Consideration
contemplated by this Section 4.1(b), (1) Parent shall not take any action with
respect to the accounting books and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries
on which the Closing Statement is to be based that are not consistent with the
CompanyÂ’s past practices, and (2) Parent shall afford, and shall cause the
Company to afford, to the Stockholder Representative and its independent
accountants reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books and records
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any purpose relating to the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 4.1(b).

 



 

(C) If a notice of disagreement is delivered in accordance with this Section
4.1(b)(iii), the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, during

 



       
 

 



 

the 30 days following such delivery, seek in good faith to reach agreement on
the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Net
Working Capital Variance, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net Operating Cash.
At the end of such period, if the Stockholder Representative and Parent are
unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter retain BDO USA,
LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in writing by the
Stockholder Representative and Parent (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Referee_ ") to review the relevant
portions of this Agreement, the Closing Statement and the disputed items or
amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Net Working Capital Variance,
Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net Operating Cash. In making such
calculation, the Referee shall be instructed to consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Statement and ParentÂ’s calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital Variance, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net Operating Cash
that the Stockholder Representative included in its notice of disagreement and
as to which there remains a disagreement. The Referee shall be instructed to
deliver to the Stockholder Representative and Parent, as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than 30 days from the date of engagement of
the Referee), a report setting forth its calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital Variance, Closing Indebtedness and Closing Net Operating Cash;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Referee may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by one of the parties, in the
case of Parent, in the Closing Statement or in the case of the Stockholder
Representative, in the notice of disagreement delivered in accordance with
this Section 4.1(b)(iii). Such report shall be final and binding upon, and
non-appealable by, the Stockholder Representative, holders of Shares and
Parent. The costs and expenses of the Referee shall be borne in the same
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted to the Referee that are unsuccessfully disputed by Parent, on the
one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, as finally
determined by the Referee, bears to the total dollar amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted.

 



 

(D) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Referee shall be limited
to (1) whether the Closing Statement and the amounts therein were prepared in
accordance with the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and
policies set forth on and applied in the preparation of the Sample
Calculation, with respect to the matters that were submitted for resolution to
the Referee and (2) whether there were mathematical errors in the Closing
Statement. The Referee is not authorized to, and shall be instructed not to,
make any other determination, including (i) any determination with respect to
any matter included in the Closing Statement or the notice of disagreement
that was not submitted for resolution to the Referee, (ii) any determination
as to whether GAAP was followed in the preparation of, or any other matter in
respect of, the financial statements included in the Company Reports, (iii)
any determination as

 



      
 

 



 

to the accuracy of Section 5.1(e) or any other representation or warranty in
this Agreement, or (iv) any determination as to compliance by the Company,
Merger Sub, Parent or Stockholder Representative with any of its covenants in
this Agreement, other than Section 4.1(b)(iii)(B).

 



 

(E) The dispute resolution by the Referee under this Section 4.1(b)(iii) shall
constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article 76 and shall
not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the Referee as to any
issue of fact shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest
error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, judgment may
be entered upon the determination of the Referee in New York State Supreme
Court or any other court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced.

 



 

(iv) _Net Adjustment Amount_.

 



 

(A) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, Parent shall within three
Business Days of the Net Adjustment Amount being finally determined pursuant
to this Section 4.1(b) pay the Net Adjustment Amount to the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account specified in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall promptly jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to use such amount to
pay (1) to the Stockholder Representative an amount equal to its expenses
incurred in connection with the exercise of its rights under Section
4.1(b)(iii) and (2) to the Paying Agent for further payment to each Person
that immediately prior to the Effective Time held Shares (other than the
Dissenting Shares) that has surrendered Shares in accordance with Section
4.2(e), an amount equal to the product of (x) such PersonÂ’s Percentage
Ownership and (y) the amount remaining in the Working Capital Escrow Fund
after making the payment contemplated by clause (1) of this Section
4.1(b)(iv)(A).

 



 

(B) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, the Stockholder Representative
and Parent shall within three Business Days of the Net Adjustment Amount being
finally determined pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay to Parent, from the funds, if any, then constituting the Working
Capital Escrow Fund an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the absolute value of
the Net Adjustment Amount and (2) the Working Capital Escrow Amount; and in
the event the amount so paid is the amount contemplated by clause (1) of this
Section 4.1(b)(iv)(B), the balance of the Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be
paid in accordance with clauses (1) and (2) of Section 4.1(b)(iv)(A).

 



 

(C) Any payments made pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) _Exclusive Remedy_. In the event the Net Adjustment Amount as finally
determined is negative and Parent is entitled to payment as contemplated by
Section 4.1(B)(iv)(B), Parent acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
the amount of such finally determined Net Adjustment Amount, ParentÂ’s right to
receive payment from the Working Capital Escrow Fund up to an amount not
exceeding the balance available in the Working Capital Escrow Fund is and
shall be ParentÂ’s sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to
any and all claims relating to the adjustment of Merger Consideration
contemplated hereby (whether arising from claims of breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise), other than
claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Parent hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have arising in respect of such
adjustment to the Merger Consideration, if any, except for claims and causes
of action pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Section 4.1(b) and
claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud.

returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash
aggregate payment of the Per Share Closing Consideration under Section 4.1(a),
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund

account under the Escrow Agreement, or pursuant to Section 6.2(c) instruct the

(e) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event,
within three Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of
Shares (whether represented by one or more Certificates or Book Entry Shares)
(x) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), substantially in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the Company and the
Stockholder Representative, specifying that delivery of Certificates shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or documentation in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(h))
to the Paying Agent and containing a provision confirming the appointment of
the Stockholder Representative, (y) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(h)) in exchange for the Per Share Closing
Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby and (z)
two certificates of non-foreign status (one applicable to individuals and one
applicable to entities) in the form prescribed by Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b). The Letter of Transmittal shall provide for payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds at the election of the holder of
Shares surrendered thereby. If any Record Holder of Shares fails to duly
execute and return such applicable certificate of non-foreign status at the
same time and by the same method as such Record Holder of Shares returns a
Letter of Transmittal pursuant to Section 4.2(e)(ii), Parent shall be entitled
to withhold and deduct (or to instruct the Paying Agent to withhold and
deduct) from any payment to be made herein an amount necessary to comply with
Code Section 1445 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(ii) _Payment for Shares_. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a Letter of
Transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares represented by Certificates (other
than Excluded Shares), duly completed and signed in accordance with its
instructions, and surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(h)) that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(h)), such Record Holder shall be entitled to receive
the Per Share Closing Consideration in respect of such Shares, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Record Holder of a Book Entry
Share shall be required to deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent to
receive the Per Share Closing Consideration in respect of such Shares, but
such Record Holder shall be required to deliver a Letter of Transmittal and,
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such Letter of Transmittal duly completed
and signed in accordance with its instructions, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Per Share Closing Consideration in respect of each Book
Entry Share of such holder, and such Book Entry Shares shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
delivered upon compliance with the procedures described above may be issued to
the transferee if the Paying Agent receives documents reasonably required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or that stock transfer Taxes are not applicable.
All cash paid as Per Share Closing Consideration upon the surrender of
Certificates or in respect of Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms
hereof shall

 



      
 

 



 

be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the applicable Shares (other than the right to receive payments, if any,
pursuant to Section 4.1(b)(iv)(A)(2) or Section 4.1(b)(iv)(B), as applicable,
from the Working Capital Escrow Fund). No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable as provided above.

 



 

(iii) Upon request of a holder of Shares, the Company and Parent shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Letter of Transmittal
(along with two certificates of non-foreign status, in accordance with Section
4.2(e)(i)(z)) to such holder prior to the Closing and, to the extent such
holder delivers to the Company a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal surrendering Shares (together with the Certificates therefor, if
applicable) at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to arrange
for payment in immediately available funds on the Closing Date of the Per
Share Closing Consideration to such holder in respect of the Shares so
surrendered prior to the Closing. Such Letters of Transmittal and
Certificates, if any, shall be held in escrow for the benefit of the holders
of Shares and promptly returned to such holders upon request if the Effective
Time does not occur.

 



 

(f) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, be delivered by the Paying Agent to
the Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or similar Laws) for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for,
payment of the Per Share Closing Consideration, without any interest thereon,
for such Shares upon surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(h)) or Book Entry Shares.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature.

 



 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay the
aggregate Per Share Closing Consideration in respect of the number of Shares
formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 



 

(i) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
instead such holder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost its
right to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
holderÂ’s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into
and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section 4.1,
without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice and a copy of
any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by
the Company relating to Company stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal, and, at
ParentÂ’s expense, Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal by Company
stockholders under the DGCL, so long as Parent does not create any pre-Closing
obligations of the Company. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



 

(j) _Tax Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or
cause such deduction or withholding to be made) from any amounts payable under
this Agreement (or in respect of transactions contemplated herein) such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or
any applicable state, local or foreign Tax laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall provide reasonable prior written notice of its intention to so
deduct and withhold to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding is required. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and
withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made for all purposes under
this Agreement.

 



 

4.3. Equity Awards.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding under the Company
Equity Plans shall become fully vested and shall be treated as a Share in
accordance with Sections 4.1 and 4.2.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board or the
compensation committee of the Company Board (or another committee duly
authorized by the Company Board for such purpose), as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take such other actions as may be necessary to implement
the provisions of this Section 4.3.

 



 

4.4. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. If between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time the outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, rights offering,
split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration
correspondingly shall be adjusted to the extent warranted to reflect such
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, rights
offering, split, combination or exchange of shares.

(ii) Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and, except for directorsÂ’ qualifying

pledge, security interest, claim, option to purchase or otherwise acquire any
interest or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ ") except for such transfer

all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement, subject only to adoption and approval of
this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the

such matter and two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of such Shares voting
thereon at a stockholdersÂ’ meeting duly called and held for such purpose or by
written consent (the " _Requisite Stockholder Approval_ ") to consummate the
Merger. For purposes of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, holders of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock shall vote together as a single class, and each
holder of Shares of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast a number of
votes per Share of Preferred Stock as is equal to the number of votes that
such holder would be entitled to cast had such holder converted such Preferred
Stock into Common Stock on the record date for such vote. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,

 



      
 

 



 

fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and to
general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 



 

(ii) The Company Board has determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and declared advisable
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
the Company Board has approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and has resolved to recommend the adoption

approval of the stockholders of the Company required to adopt this Agreement
and approve the transactions contemplated hereby is the Requisite Stockholder
Approval.

 



 

(iii) When executed and delivered, the Merger Consent shall constitute the
Requisite Stockholder Approval in compliance with applicable Law and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, and no other vote or
action of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of the
Company will be necessary under applicable Law, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company to adopt this Agreement and consummate
the Merger.

(i) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not: (A)
conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company; (B) assuming all consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations
and permits contemplated by clauses (A) through (E) of Section 5.1(d)(ii) have
been obtained, and all filings described in such clauses have been made,
conflict with, result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default
(or an event which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would become
a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any
breach or violation of, a termination or right of termination, acceleration or
other alteration in the rights under, any Material Contract; or (C) assuming
all consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations and permits contemplated
by clauses (A) through (E) of Section 5.1(d)(ii) have been obtained, and all

is subject except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above, for any such
conflict, breach, violation, default, termination, acceleration, loss,
alteration or other occurrence that would not, individually or in the

prevent or materially delay the CompanyÂ’s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or materially adversely affect the
CompanyÂ’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and all other
applicable Laws, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

manner that gives rise to withdrawal liability, that has not been satisfied in
full. No member of the Company Group has incurred a 70 percent contribution
decline (as that phrase is defined in Section 4205 of ERISA) in connection
with a Multiemployer Plan within any of the last three plan years. No member
of the Company Group has received notice from a trustee, sponsor,

in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(ix) No member of the Company Group has any obligations to provide, and no
Benefit Plan provides, any benefits (including death or medical benefits) with
respect to any former or current employee of the Company Group (" _Company
Employees_ ") or other current or former service provider beyond termination
of service with or retirement from service.

 



 

(x) None of the execution of this Agreement, the approval and adoption of this
Agreement or the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in
connection with any other event(s), condition(s) or circumstance(s), including
any termination or service) could (A) result in any payment or benefit
becoming due, or increase the amount of compensation, payments or benefits
due, to any current or former Company Employee or other current or former
service provider, (B) result in or increase any payment or benefits otherwise
payable under any Benefit Plan, (C) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any compensation or benefits, or (D) result in the

or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, whether alone or together with any other
event(s), condition(s) or circumstance(s), by any employee, officer, director,
consultant or other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, or any other Person who is a "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1), could, as of the
Closing, be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 



 

(xii) No Benefit Plan or other Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound provides any individual with a
"gross up" or similar payment in respect of any Taxes that may become payable

(xiii) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, (A) the written terms of such arrangement
have at all times since January 1, 2010 been in compliance with, and (B) such

closings, layoffs, employee and independent contractor classifications,
immigration, affirmative action, data privacy and protection, terms and
conditions of employment or service, wages and hours and nondiscrimination in
employment) and all applicable industrial instruments. All service providers
of the Company or its Subsidiaries are correctly classified as employees,
independent contractors, or otherwise for all purposes (including any
applicable Tax and employment policies or Law), except as would not,

liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have not and are not engaged in any unfair labor practice.

 



 

(iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in an

not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, prevent
or materially delay the CompanyÂ’s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or materially adversely affect the CompanyÂ’s
ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Company and its
Subsidiaries and, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, their respective directors,

would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, prevent or materially delay the CompanyÂ’s
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
materially adversely affect the CompanyÂ’s ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred
which permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both would
permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or

face), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to

leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business

 



      
 

 



 

requires such qualification, except where any such failure to be so organized,
qualified, in good standing or to have such power or authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or materially adversely affect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their obligations under this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Organizational Authority and Approval_. No vote of holders of shares or
other equity securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
Parent in its capacity as stockholder of Merger Sub) is necessary to approve

Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite organizational power and
authority and has taken all organizational action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement, subject
only to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, which will occur immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, and to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

that all consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations and permits
contemplated by clauses (A) through (E) of Section of 5.2(c)(ii) below have
been obtained, and all filings described in such clauses have been made,

(or an event which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would become
a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any
breach or violation of, a termination or right of termination, acceleration or
other alteration in the rights under, any Contract to which Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries is party or is subject; or (C) assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations, declarations and permits contemplated by clauses
(A) through (E) of Section of 5.2(c)(ii) below have been obtained, and all
filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any
Law, License or judgment to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C) above, for any such
conflict, violation, breach, termination, default, acceleration, loss,
alteration or other occurrence that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability
of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to perform their obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by
Parent and Merger Sub do not and will not require Parent or Merger Sub to make
or

 



      
 

 



 

obtain any consent, approval, authorization, declaration or permit of, action

notification the failure of which to make or obtain, would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to perform their obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Litigation_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to
enjoin, or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing,
making illegal, or otherwise materially interfering with, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to perform their obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Available Funds_. Parent will have at the Closing funds sufficient to (i)
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent and/or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) satisfy all of the other
payment obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub contemplated hereunder.

 



 

(f) _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
one share of which is validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.
Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no,
and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incidental to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, finder, financial advisor or investment
banker is entitled to any brokerage, finderÂ’s or other fee or commission
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

(h) _Licensability_. None of Parent or Merger Sub, or to ParentÂ’s Knowledge,
any of their respective Management Principals or Affiliates which may
reasonably be considered

 



      
 

 



 

in the process of determining the suitability of Parent and Merger Sub for any
Gaming License by any Gaming Authorities, or any holders of ParentÂ’s capital
stock or other equity interests who will be required to be licensed or found
suitable under applicable Gaming Laws (the foregoing persons collectively, the
" _Licensing Affiliates_ "), has abandoned or withdrawn (in each case in
response to a communication from a Gaming Authority regarding a likely or
impending denial, suspension or revocation) or been denied or had suspended or
revoked a Gaming License, or an application for a Gaming License, by a Gaming
Authority, within the five years prior to the date hereof. Parent, Merger Sub,
and each of their respective Licensing Affiliates which is licensed or holds
any Gaming License pursuant to applicable Gaming Laws (collectively, the "
_Licensed Parties_ ") is in good standing in each of the jurisdictions in
which such Licensed Party owns, operates, or manages gaming facilities. To
ParentÂ’s Knowledge, there are no facts which, if known to any Gaming
Authority, would be reasonably likely to (i) result in the denial, revocation,
limitation or suspension of a Gaming License of any of the Licensed Parties or
(ii) result in a negative outcome to any finding of suitability proceedings of
any of the Licensed Parties currently pending, or under the suitability
proceedings necessary for the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(i) _Compliance with Gaming Laws_.

 



 

(i) Each of the Licensed Parties, and, to ParentÂ’s Knowledge, each of the
Licensed PartiesÂ’ Management Principals, holds all Gaming Licenses and all
such permits as are necessary to conduct the business and operations of the
Licensed Parties as currently conducted, each of which is in full force and
effect in all material respects (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except for such
permits not held or in full force and effect as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or materially adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to perform their obligations under this Agreement, and no event has
occurred which permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or
both would permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension,
limitation or termination of any Parent Permit that currently is in effect,
the loss of which, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their
obligations under this Agreement. Each of the Licensed Parties and each of
the Licensed PartiesÂ’ respective Management Principals is in compliance with
the terms of the Parent Permits, except for such failures to comply which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or materially adversely affect the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their obligations under this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Licensing Affiliates has received
written notice with respect to any investigation or review by any Gaming
Authority or other Governmental Entity of Parent or any of its Licensing
Affiliates or Management Principals that is pending, and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, no investigation or review is threatened, other than those
investigations and reviews the outcome of which would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub

 



      
 

 



 

to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) No Licensed Party, and, to ParentÂ’s Knowledge, no Licensing Affiliate or
Management Principal of any Licensed Party, has received any written claim,
demand, notice, complaint, court order or administrative order from any Gaming
Authority or other Governmental Entity in the past three years under, or
relating to any violation or possible violation of, any Gaming Law which did
or would be reasonably likely to result in an individual fine or penalty of
$250,000 or more. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts which if
known to any Gaming Authority would reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation, limitation or suspension of a Gaming License or other material
Parent Permit, finding of suitability, registration, or other permit or
approval of the Licensed Parties, or any of their respective Licensing
Affiliates or Management Principals, except for such revocations, limitations
or suspensions which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their
obligations under this Agreement. None of the Licensed Parties, and, to
ParentÂ’s Knowledge, none of their respective Licensing Affiliates or
Management Principals, has suffered a suspension, denial, non-renewal,
limitation or revocation of any Parent Permit within the last three years.

 



 

(j) _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
has entered into any Contract or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any Contract or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), (i) pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration in
respect of such stockholdersÂ’ Shares of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) with any member
of the CompanyÂ’s management or directors that relates in any way to the
Company or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(k) _Stock Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at any time
during the last three years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

 



 

(l) _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.1, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives, nor any other
Person on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives, has made or is making any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including with
respect to any information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub.
Except for claims arising from fraud, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives, will have or be
subject to

 



      
 

 



 

any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent or Merger Sub resulting
from the delivery, dissemination or any other distribution to Parent, Merger
Sub or their respective Representatives, or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Representatives of any projections, forecasts or other
forward-looking information, business plans or other material provided or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives, including
in certain "data rooms" or management presentations in anticipation or
contemplation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(m) _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts, Forward-
Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its business and
operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans), and that (except for claims arising from fraud) Parent and Merger Sub
will have no claim against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Representatives, with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that, except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement, none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective Representatives, has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections, forecasts,
forward-looking statements or business plans).

Statement shall also contain (i) the notice of action by written consent
required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and (ii) the notice of availability of

thereunder to be set forth in the Information Statement, that is customarily
included in information statements prepared in connection with transactions of

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agree that none of the information supplied
by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Information Statement will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall
reasonably promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC
with respect to the Information Statement and of any request by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company
and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Information
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (with the
assistance of Parent) to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to
all comments received on the Information Statement from the SEC and the
Company shall cause the definitive

or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, to the fullest
extent reasonably practicable the Company shall provide Parent with an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall in
good faith consider for inclusion in such document or response comments
reasonably proposed by Parent.

necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable
Laws (including under any Antitrust Law and under any applicable Gaming Law)
to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Termination Date, including

period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company, to the
fullest extent reasonably practicable, will consult with the other and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any notice or filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental

such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Information Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including under the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Law and
the Gaming Laws.

 



 

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, to the fullest extent reasonably practicable, the Company
and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other written
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. To the fullest extent reasonably practicable, neither the
Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other
Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

other undertakings and limitations on undertakings pursuant to this Section
6.5:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Parent and the Company shall not take or permit any of their respective
Affiliates to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) Parent and the Company shall promptly provide, or cause to be provided,

(iii) Parent shall promptly provide, or use its reasonable best efforts to
cause to be provided, to each and every Gaming Authority such information and
documents that are necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Gaming
Licenses, and to the extent any Gaming Authority requests information or
documentary material from Parent or its Affiliates, including supporting,
supplemental, or additional documentation from any Gaming Authority, then
Parent shall in good faith provide, or cause to be provided, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the Company, information
and documentary material that are complete and responsive in all material
respects to such request; and

 



 

(iv) Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
resolve, avoid or eliminate impediments or objections that may be asserted by
such Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and avoid the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination,
judgment, investigation or Law that would materially delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement prior to the Termination Date.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.5 or otherwise in
this Agreement shall require Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to (i) litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action or

temporary, preliminary or permanent that would restrain, prevent, enjoin or

shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers and other authorized
Representatives of Parent, reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees,
properties, books, contracts, personnel files and records and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish to

confidential by reason of Contracts with third parties entered into prior to
the date hereof. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, with respect to the information disclosed
pursuant to this Section 6.6, Parent shall comply and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives to comply with all of its
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. In any event, Parent shall be

communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (ii) of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to such partyÂ’s knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
otherwise affecting such party of any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) if such party becomes
aware of any facts or circumstances that such party believes do, or with the
passage of time are reasonably likely to, constitute a material breach of this
Agreement by the other party.

 



 

6.7. Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release. Thereafter, the parties will consult with each other and
will mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such press releases or make any such public announcements prior to such
consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law or by

exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may make any
public statement in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences or financial analysts conference calls,
so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with, and do not provide
material information not otherwise disclosed in, previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Company and Parent
or made by one party and reviewed by the other and do not reveal non-public
information regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.8. Employee Benefits

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time and continuing through the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each Company Employee as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any employees covered by a collective
bargaining agreement or other Contract or work rule or practice with any labor
union, labor organization or works council), to the extent the Company
Employee remains employed by the Surviving Corporation, (i) a base salary or
regular hourly wage which is no less than the base salary or regular hourly
wage provided to such Company Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits that
are comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to such Company Employee
by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.8(a) shall not prohibit
transitioning Company Employees to employee benefit plans maintained by Parent
provided that the obligations in clause (ii) above are satisfied by such
plans.

 



 

(b) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause any of its
employee benefit plans in which a Company Employee is entitled to participate
in to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of
benefits (other than for benefit accruals under defined benefit pension
plans), service by such Company Employee with the Company as if such service
were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the Company (except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits).

 



 

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, with respect to any employee
benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries maintained for the benefit of the
employees, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in
respect of Company Employees to use their reasonable efforts to (i) cause
there to be waived or waive any pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-
at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible,
co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such
Company Employees during the calendar year in which Effective Time occurs
under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) To the extent that any payment made or to be made (or any amount or other
benefit provided or to be provided) with respect to, or which could arise as a
result of or in connection with, this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, whether alone or together with any other
event(s), condition(s) or circumstance(s) (including any termination of
employment or service), could be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment"

 



      
 

 



 

(within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), the Company will: (i)
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any event
no later than 10 Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date), disclose
its calculations with respect to all such payments, amounts and benefits to
Parent, along with all assumptions used to make those calculations and all
data necessary for Parent to confirm the accuracy of those calculations; (ii)
except to the extent any such payment, amount or benefit is, by its existing
terms, conditioned on the receipt of stockholder approval, not more than seven
days prior to the Closing Date, seek and obtain the effective and enforceable
consent of each recipient of any such payment, amount or benefit that would
otherwise be due and owing, unconditionally waiving such payment, amount or
benefit such that such payment, amount or benefit will not be due and owing,
paid or retained, absent the stockholder approval of such payments, amounts
and benefits in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the
Code and the applicable treasury regulations thereunder; and (iii) promptly
following the execution of all unconditional waivers required by the
immediately preceding clause (ii) (and, regardless of whether any such
unconditional waivers are required, in no event later than two days prior to
the Closing Date), cause all such payments, amounts and benefits to be
adequately disclosed to, and obtain the approval of all such payments, amounts
and benefits by, all Persons in accordance with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code and the applicable treasury regulations thereunder, in
all cases in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Parent will have the
right, and the Company will provide Parent with not less than three Business
Days, to review and approve (A) any waivers required by the immediately
preceding clause (ii) before such waivers are executed and (B) any disclosure
and related solicitation materials required by the immediately preceding
clause (iii) before such disclosure and solicitation occur.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under Section 4.3, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, (i)
prohibit the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates from amending or
terminating any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable Law,
(ii) require the Surviving Corporation to keep any person employed for any
period of time, or (iii) constitute the establishment or adoption of, or
amendment to, any Benefit Plan, and no person participating in any such
Benefit Plan maintained by either the Company or Parent shall have any claim
or cause of action, under ERISA or otherwise, in respect of any provisions of
this Agreement as it relates to any such Benefit Plan or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.8
is intended to, or does, confer upon any Person (including any current or
former Company Employee or any other current or former service provider of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) any
rights of any nature whatsoever, and no such Person is an intended third-party
beneficiary of any portion of this Section 6.8.

 



 

6.9. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except (a) Parent
and the Company shall each bear 50% of the expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with the filing fees for the Information Statement and any Taxes or
fees governed by Section 6.15 and (b) Parent shall pay all filing fees payable
under the HSR Act.

 



      
 

 



 

6.10. Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

 



 

6.11. Parent Vote and Merger Sub.

 



 

(a) Immediately after the date hereof, Parent shall vote (or consent with
respect to) or cause to be voted (or a consent to be given with respect to)
all of the shares of common stock of Merger Sub in favor of the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby at a
meeting of stockholders of Merger Sub at which this Agreement shall be
submitted for adoption and approval and at all adjournments or postponements
thereof (or by any action by written consent of the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub in lieu of a meeting)

 



 

(b) Parent will take all action necessary (i) to cause Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) to ensure that, prior to the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any
investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
shall be responsible for any failure of Merger Sub to comply with any
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision required to be performed
on or prior to the Closing under this Agreement.

 



 

6.12. Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably required to cause dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby by each individual who is a director or officer of the
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.13. Transaction Litigation. In the event that any stockholder litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought against the Company and/or the members of the
Company Board after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time
(" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly notify Parent of
any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate, at its sole cost and expense, in the defense or settlement of
any Transaction Litigation in accordance with the terms of a mutually agreed
upon joint defense agreement. The Company may not enter into any settlement
agreement in respect of any Transaction Litigation that includes terms that
would impose any restriction on the CompanyÂ’s operations following the Closing
without ParentÂ’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



      
 

 



 

6.14. Director and Officer Liability.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it will, and Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law (and also to advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified PartiesÂ’ service as a director
or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such
Persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the extension of the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability coverage
of the CompanyÂ’s existing directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance policies for a
claims reporting or discovery period of six years from and after the Effective
Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
CompanyÂ’s current insurance carrier with respect to directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance or otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable in the aggregate as the
CompanyÂ’s existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company
for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are at least as favorable in the aggregate as provided in the
CompanyÂ’s existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable in the aggregate as provided in the CompanyÂ’s existing
policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. To
the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pay any premiums with
respect to such "tail" insurance policies prior to 12:00 midnight Las Vegas
time on the Closing Date, the amount so paid shall be added to the sum of the
CompanyÂ’s Cash and Cash Equivalents for purposes of the calculations pursuant
to Section 4.1(b).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.14.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.14 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.14 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation, certificate of formation or bylaws of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 



 

6.15. Transfer Taxes. The Company and Parent agree to share equally any and
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
similar Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.16. No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. Parent shall not take any
action with respect to the Company subsequent to the Closing that would cause
the transactions contemplated hereby to constitute part of a transaction that
is the same as, or substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax
Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

 



 

6.17. Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(a) The Stockholder Representative shall have the authority, for and on behalf
of holders of Shares (except for the holders, if any, of Dissenting Shares),
to take such actions and exercise such discretion as are required of the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, and any such actions shall be binding on each such holder
and shall include the following: (i) to receive, hold and deliver to Parent
and the Surviving Corporation Certificates and any other documents relating

notices on behalf of such holder; (iii) to defend, negotiate, agree to, enter

of such holder; (v) to amend, supplement, change or waive any provision
hereof, subject to compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and (vi) to
take any and all actions necessary or appropriate in the sole discretion of
the Stockholder Representative to accomplish any of the foregoing. As the
representative of such holders, the Stockholder Representative shall act as
agent for each such holder and shall have authority to bind each such holder
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and
Parent and Merger Sub may rely on such appointment and authority. The
Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from such
holders of any and all fees, expenses and costs incurred in the performance of
such Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s duties hereunder.

 



 

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the holders of
Shares for any act done or omitted to be taken as Stockholder Representative
except expressly as set forth herein. The Persons who immediately prior to the
Effective Time held Shares and who received, or are entitled to receive, the
Merger Consideration shall, in proportion to the number of Shares of Common
Stock held as compared to the total number of such Shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including in each such case, the number of Shares of Common Stock
into which each Share of Preferred Stock held by such holder is convertible
immediately prior to the Effective Time), indemnify and hold harmless the
Stockholder Representative and its partners, stockholders, affiliates,
directors, officers, fiduciaries, employees and agents of each of the
foregoing (each, a " _Representative Indemnified Party_ ") from and against
all losses, liabilities, claims or expenses incurred or suffered by the
Representative Indemnified Parties as a result of, or arising out of, or
relating to any and all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Stockholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or in
connection with the incurrence, payment, discharge or settlement of any of the
obligations of such holders, except for any such losses, liabilities, claims
or expenses that arise on account of the Stockholder RepresentativeÂ’s gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final adjudication. None of the Representative Indemnified
Parties shall be liable to any Person who immediately prior to the Effective
Time held Shares in respect of such arrangements or actions or omissions in
connection therewith, except to the extent that such acts or omissions
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 



 

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative
under or relating to this Agreement shall constitute a decision for all
Persons who immediately prior to the Effective Time held Shares, and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each such Person, and Parent and Merger Sub
may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of such
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each such Person. Parent and Merger Sub are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

 



 

(d) If Trilliant Gaming Nevada Inc. becomes unable to serve as Stockholder
Representative, such other Person or Persons may be designated by the holders
of a majority of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including the Shares of Preferred Stock on an as-converted to Common
Stock basis), and such Person or Persons shall succeed as the Stockholder
Representative.

 



       
 

 



 

6.18. Certain Notifications. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, Parent and the Company shall promptly notify each other in writing,
as soon as practical after it becomes known to such party, of any fact,
circumstance, event or action which will result in, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, the failure of Parent or the Company to timely satisfy
any of the closing conditions specified in Article VII hereof. Nothing
contained in this Section 6.18 shall prevent Parent or the Company from taking
any action to cure any of the foregoing. No notice given pursuant to this
Section 6.18 shall have any effect on the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of
determining satisfaction of any condition contained herein.

 



 

6.19. Indebtedness.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain customary debt
payoff letters and related ancillary documents in respect of the payment in
full of all amounts due under the Company Credit Facility, and providing for
the release of all Liens under and the termination of the Company Credit
Facility and all related Contracts to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, including guarantees conditioned solely upon payment
of such amounts (collectively, the " _Debt Payoff Documents_ "), and shall
deliver true copies thereof to Parent on or prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent or Merger Sub as reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with obtaining any debt financing of Parent
or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Effective Time, including commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish financial and other pertinent information of the
Company necessary to show the pro forma impact of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on Parent and its Subsidiaries and cooperate
with the creation and perfection of pledge and security instruments effective
as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the Company shall be reimbursed
for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company
or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation, and to the extent any
such costs and expenses have not been paid prior to the Closing, all of such
costs and expenses shall be excluded from current Liabilities for purposes of
determining Net Working Capital.

 



 

6.20. Tax Matters. Without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any election, change
an annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method, file any
amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or
assessment relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, surrender any
right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or take any other similar action relating
to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such election,
adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender, consent or
other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period ending after the Closing
Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
existing on the Closing Date.

(f) _Material Agreements_. The agreements set forth in Section 7.2(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not have been terminated as set forth in
such Section 7.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

7.3. Conditions to Obligation of the Company. The obligation of the Company to
effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Company
at or prior to the Closing of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct as
of the date of this Agreement and on and as of the Closing Date with the same
force and effect as if made on and as of such date (except for those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date, which representations and warranties shall have been true and correct on
and as of such particular date) except for any failures to be so true and
correct that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of Parent and Merger Sub by a senior executive officer of Parent to such
effect.

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing
Date, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub by a senior executive officer of Parent to such effect.

 



 

7.4. Frustration of Closing Conditions. None of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.1, 7.2 or
7.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was primarily caused
by such partyÂ’s failure to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

 _Termination_

 



 

8.1. Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the time the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, by
mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

 



 

8.2. Termination by Either Parent or the Company. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time by action of either the board of directors of Parent or the Company Board
if:

 



 

(a) the Merger shall not have been consummated by January 28, 2016 (as may be
extended in accordance with this Section 8.2(a), the " _Termination Date_ ")
whether such date is before or after the time the Requisite Stockholder
Approval is obtained; provided, that if all of the conditions to Closing shall
have been satisfied, shall be capable of being satisfied at such

 



      
 

 



 

time or would be capable of being satisfied at such time but for the fact that
the condition set forth in Section 7.2(e) is not satisfied, the Termination
Date may be extended by Parent or the Company from time to time by written
notice to the other to a date not later than April 28, 2016; and provided,
further _,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.2(a) shall not be available to any party if the failure of the
Merger to have been consummated on or before the Termination Date was
primarily due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable (whether
before or after the time the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained);
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.2(b) shall not be available to any party if the enactment, issuance,
promulgation, enforcement or entry of such Order, or the Order becoming final
and non-appealable, was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform
any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) if the Merger Consent, duly executed by the Listed Stockholders, shall not
have been delivered to Parent and the Company prior to 9:00 a.m., New York
City time, on the date immediately following the date of this Agreement.

 



 

8.3. Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned by the Company by action of the Company Board at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether such date is before or after the
time the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, if there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent
or Merger Sub in this Agreement, which breach (a) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and (b) (i) by
its nature or timing cannot be cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the
Termination Date or (ii) if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
by the earlier of (A) the date 30 calendar days following receipt of written
notice from the Company of such breach and (B) the Termination Date;
_provided_ that, the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3 if it is then in material breach of any
representation, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would
result in the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b)
not being satisfied.

 



 

8.4. Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned by action of the board of directors of Parent, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether such date is before or after the time the
Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company in this
Agreement, which breach (a) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and (b) (i) by its nature or timing cannot
be cured by the Company by the Termination Date or (ii) if capable of being
cured, shall not have been cured by the earlier of (A) the date 30 calendar
days following receipt of written notice from the Parent of such breach and
(B) the Termination Date; _provided_ that, Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.4 if Parent or Merger Sub
is then in material breach of any representation, warranties, covenants or
other agreements hereunder that would result in the closing conditions set
forth in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) not being satisfied.

 



      
 

 



 

8.5. Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms
and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); provided, however, that (i) no such termination shall relieve or
release any party from any liability or damages arising from (A) any failure
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby if
required pursuant to this Agreement, or (B) fraud or an intentional and
material breach of any provision of this Agreement prior to such termination,
and in each case the aggrieved party will be entitled to all rights and
remedies available at law or in equity, and (ii) the provisions set forth in
Section 6.9, the last sentence of Section 6.6(a), this Section 8.5, Article IX
(and the definitions of all defined terms appearing in the foregoing sections)
and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "intentional and material breach"
means a material breach of this Agreement that is a consequence of an act (or
failure to act) by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of
(or the failure to take) such act would, or would be reasonably expected to,
cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and, at the time of such termination, all of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 (other than Section 7.1(c)) and Section
7.2 (other than Section 7.2(e)) shall have been satisfied or shall be capable
of being satisfied at such time but the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c)
or Section 7.2(e) have not been satisfied, Parent shall pay the Company, (i)
concurrently with a termination by Parent or (ii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) following a
termination by the Company, $21,000,000 (the " _Break-Up Fee_ "), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company.

 



 

(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) if such Order is related to Gaming Laws,
Parent shall pay the Company, (i) concurrently with a termination by Parent or
(ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, within three (3)
Business Days) following a termination by the Company, the Break-Up Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company.

 



 

(d) In the event of termination of this Agreement for (i) any reason other
than by Parent in accordance with Section 8.4, the parties shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to promptly release and pay the balance of the Section 6.2 Escrow
Fund to the Company or (ii) by Parent in accordance with Section 8.4, the
parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release and pay the
balance of the Section 6.2 Escrow Fund to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
payment of the Section 6.2 Escrow Fund to the Company in accordance with
clause (i) of this Section 8.5(d) shall be in addition to any Break-Up Fee
otherwise payable to the Company pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(c).

 



 

(e) Any Break-Up Fee payable by Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section
8.5(c), as applicable, and/or any amount released to the Company from the
Section 6.2 Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.5(d)(i) shall be paid as
liquidated damages (and not as a penalty), it

 



      
 

 



 

being agreed among the Parties that (i) the actual damages to the Company in
such events are impractical to ascertain and the amount of the Break-Up Fee
and the Section 6.2 Escrow Fund are reasonable estimates thereof in the
circumstances in which they are payable and (ii) upon payment of the Break-Up
Fee and any amount to be released to the Company from the Section 6.2 Escrow
Fund pursuant to Section 8.5(d)(i), none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters
forming the basis for such termination. In no event shall Parent be obligated
to pay the Break-Up Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

 _Miscellaneous and General_

 



 

9.1. Survival. None of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered under this Agreement shall survive
the Effective Time. This Section 9.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement
of the parties to this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance
after the Effective Time.

 



 

9.2. Modification or Amendment; Waivers.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by
written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the
respective parties, whether before or after stockholder approval hereof;
_provided however_ , after stockholder approval hereof no amendment shall be
made which by Law requires the further approval of such stockholders without
such further approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this sentence of this Section 9.2, Section 9.5(a), Section 9.5(c),
the last sentence of Section 9.8, and Section 9.17 may not be amended,
modified, waived or terminated in a manner adverse in any respect to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by applicable Law.

 



 

9.3. Waiver of Conditions. The conditions to each of the partiesÂ’ obligations
to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party and may be
waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws.

 



 

9.4. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts shall together constitute the same agreement. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other

 



      
 

 



 

oral or written agreement or other communication). This Agreement may be
executed by facsimile or electronic signature and a facsimile or electronic
signature shall constitute an original for all purposes.

 



 

9.5. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; PROCESS AGENT; REMEDIES.

 



 

(a) THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW
THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

 



 

(b) Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action, suit or
proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of, related to or based on this
Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the
extent such Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") and solely in
connection with claims arising under, related to or based on this Agreement or
the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement (i) irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any
objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen
Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient
forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv) agrees that
service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be
effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 9.6 of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5(c).

 



 

(d) _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including as
set forth in Section 8.5(e)), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and

 



      
 

 



 

that the parties shall be entitled, unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with Article VIII, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any of the Chosen Courts, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party hereby
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under
this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. The parties
hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
Section 9.5(d), a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) in the event that the remedies provided for in
this Section 9.5(d) are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii)
nothing set forth in this Section 9.5(d) shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any partyÂ’s right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 9.5(d) prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article VIII (and/or
seeking any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement (including monetary damages)).

requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary

an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



       
 

 



 

9.10. Mutual Drafting. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating
and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

9.11. Definitions. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. Any capitalized terms
used in any Annex or Schedule but not otherwise defined therein, shall have
the meaning as defined in this Agreement.

 



 

9.12. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,
is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

 



 

9.13. Interpretation; Construction.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Annex, such
reference shall be to a Section or Annex, as applicable, of this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other theory extends and
such phrase shall not mean "if."

 



 

(c) Any singular term in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural,
and any plural term the singular. References in the singular or to "him,"
"her," "it," "itself," or other like references, and references in the plural
or the feminine or masculine reference, as the case may be, shall also, when
the context so requires, be deemed to include the plural or singular, or the
masculine or feminine reference, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) References to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute as
amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder. References to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or
contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof. References to any Person include the
successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References from or

 



      
 

 



 

through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including or
through and including such date, respectively.

 



 

(e) References to "days" shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are
specified. If any period expires on a day which is not a Business Day or any
event or condition is required by the terms of this Agreement to occur or be
fulfilled on a day which is not a Business Day, such period shall expire or
such event or condition shall occur or be fulfilled, as the case may be, on
the next succeeding Business Day. Any action required to be taken "within" a
specified time period following the occurrence of an event shall be required
to be taken by no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last day of such
time period, which shall be calculated starting with the day immediately
following the date of the event.

 



 

(f) An accounting term not otherwise defined has the meaning assigned to it in
accordance with GAAP.

 



 

(g) All monetary figures shall be in United States dollars unless otherwise
specified.

 



 

(h) "made available" means (unless otherwise specified), with respect to a
particular document, item or other piece of information, inclusion and
availability in the virtual data room hosted by RR Donnelley Venue in
connection with the Merger on or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York time on April 27,
2015. The Company shall be deemed to have made available to Parent and Merger
Sub any document filed (on a publicly available basis) with the SEC prior to
the date hereof.

 



 

9.14. Disclosure Schedules. Each party hereto has or may have set forth
information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule,
as applicable, in a section thereof that corresponds to the Section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule
shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be
disclosed by this Agreement. The mere inclusion of an item by the Company in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or by Parent and Merger Sub in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for
purposes of) a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that (a) such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to
have, with respect to the Company, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and with
respect to Parent, a material adverse effect, as applicable or (b) such
information (or any non-disclosed information of comparable or greater
significance) is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or is
material to the business, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company or Parent, as applicable.

 



 

9.15. Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Agreement is void.

 



      
 

 



 

9.16. Legal Representation.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges that Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP (" _Fried Frank_ ") currently serves as counsel
to both (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries and (b) Onex Corporation and its
Affiliates (the " _Onex Group_ "), including Trilliant Gaming Nevada Inc. in
its capacity as the Stockholder Representative, both in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and in connection with
other matters. There may come a time, including after consummation of the
Merger, when the interests of the Onex Group and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason, the Onex Group,
Fried Frank or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries believes that Fried
Frank can or should no longer represent both the Onex Group and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. The parties understand and specifically agree that
Fried Frank may withdraw from representing the Company and its Subsidiaries
and continue to represent the Onex Group (or any other holder of Shares), even
if the interests of the Onex Group (or such other holder of Shares), and the
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are or may be adverse,
including in connection with any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the documents or transactions contemplated hereby, and
even though Fried Frank may have represented the Company and its Subsidiaries
in a matter substantially related to such dispute, and Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company hereby consent thereto and waive any conflict of interest arising
therefrom.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all communications on or
prior to the Closing Date among Fried Frank, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries and the Onex Group (or any other holder of Shares), the attorney-
client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other rights to
any evidentiary privilege belong to the Onex Group and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Company or any of its Affiliates. In addition, if the Merger is
consummated, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no right of
access to or control over any of Fried FrankÂ’s records related to the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, which shall become the property
of (and be controlled by) the Onex Group and (ii) it would be impracticable to
remove from the records (including emails and other electronic files) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries any privileged communications with Fried Frank.
Accordingly, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub agree not
to rely upon such privileged communications that may remain in the records of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, and the parties agree that no attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product or other privilege or protection is waived or
intended to be waived by allowing such material to remain in the files of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between
the Onex Group and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of or
relating to any matter in which Fried Frank acted for them both, none of the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or any other
rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to the Onex
Group any information or documents developed or shared during the course of
