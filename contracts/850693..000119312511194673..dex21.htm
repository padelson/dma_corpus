independently in the same formulation and dosage, and B is the sum of the
average gross selling prices in such country of such Other API(s) sold
separately in the same formulation and dosage, during the applicable Calendar

(ii) If the Product is sold independently of the Other API(s) therein

Net Sales (as described above) of the Combination Product by the fraction A/C
where A is the average gross selling price in such country of such Product
sold independently and C is the average gross selling price in such country
of the entire Combination Product.

 

(iii) If the Other API(s) are sold independently of the Product therein
in such country, but the average gross selling price of such Product cannot
be determined, Net Sales will be calculated by multiplying the total Net Sales
(as described above) of the Combination Product by the fraction (1-B/C), where
B is the average gross selling price in the Territory of such Other API(s)
and C is the average gross selling price in the Territory of the entire
Combination Product.

(iv) If neither the Product nor the Other API(s) are sold independently
in such country, the Parties shall determine Net Sales for such Combination
Product by mutual agreement based on the relative contribution of the Product
and the other active ingredient(s) in the Combination Product.

For purposes of the foregoing, in the Calendar Year during which a Combination
Product is first sold in a country, a forecasted average gross selling price
shall be used for the Product and the Other API(s), to be determined in good
faith mutually by the Parties. Any over or under payment due to a difference
between forecasted and actual average gross selling prices in such country

combination thereof), Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholders
Representative a reasonably detailed statement setting forth Net Sales for

Statement_ "). Net Sales shall be accrued in the ordinary course of business,

its Affiliates) available for inspection by the Accounting Firm during regular
business hours at the facility(ies) where such records are customarily kept,

the amount of Net Sales determined by the Accounting Firm exceeds the amount
of Net Sales set forth in the Net Sales Statement prepared by Parent by more
than five percent (5%), Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, the

conditions, the proprietary position of such pharmaceutical product, the
regulatory structure involved, and other relevant technical, legal,
scientific, medical or commercial factors, and the profitability of such

The Shareholders Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such Set Off Notice to review such Set Off Notice and, during such thirty (30)-day period, Shareholders Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any discrepancies in the set off amount proposed by Parent.

time following the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any earnings received with respect thereto) that had been
made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to
Shareholders and thereafter such Shareholders shall be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) and only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Applicable Merger Consideration payable to them, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a certificate formerly
representing shares of Company Capital Stock for any amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Shareholders three (3) years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time

Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any other applicable Law. To the extent that

Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Shareholders to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

SECTION 3.07 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event
any certificate(s) which formerly represented shares of Company Capital Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by the Company Stockholder thereof in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay such
Company Stockholder such Company Stockholders Stock Closing Payment as
provided in _Section 3.03(b)_; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its
sole discretion and as a condition precedent to issuing such instruction to
the Paying Agent, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

SECTION 3.08 _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of  _Section
3.03(b)_ shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such,
except that the obligations of Parent under _Section 3.03(b)_ shall commence
on the date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the applicable amounts
provided in _Section 3.03(b)_.

requirements of all applicable Laws. The Company has performed all material
obligations required to be performed by it under, is not in default under or
in violation, and has no Knowledge of any default or violation by any party
to, any Benefit Plan. No Action is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened with respect to any Benefit Plan (other than claims for benefits in
the Ordinary Course of Business) and, to the Companys Knowledge, no fact or
event exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
Action, including, any audit or investigation by the IRS, the Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental
Authority. No non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Sections 406
and 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any
Benefit Plan that would subject the Company to any tax or penalty under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. With respect to the Benefit
Plans, no event has occurred and, to the Companys Knowledge, there exists no
condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company could

the Code is so exempt, and no fact or event has occurred since the date of
such determination letter which has adversely affected or is likely to
adversely affect such qualified or exempt status.

(g) All employer or employee contributions, premiums or payments
required by applicable Law or pursuant to the terms of any Benefit Plan to be
made with respect to any Benefit Plan, have been timely paid in full, or, to
the extent not yet due, have been accrued in accordance with the Interim
Financial Statements. All such contributions have been fully deducted for
income tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by
any Governmental Authority and, to the Companys Knowledge, no fact or event
exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such challenge
or disallowance.

 

(h) There does not now exist, and, to the Companys Knowledge,
there are no circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in,
any Controlled Group Liability, as hereinafter defined, that would be a
Liability of the Company following the Closing. For the purposes of this
paragraph, " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all Liabilities,
contingent or otherwise (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of
ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) result from a
violation of the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of

Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in Section 4.12(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash,
property, the vesting of property or otherwise) as a result of or in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event) or by any of
the Ancillary Documents, by any employee, officer, director or other service
provider of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).

Intellectual Property is incorporated into, integrated or bundled with, or

the Products, the Company has a written agreement with such third-party
pursuant to which the Company either (A) has obtained ownership of, and is
the exclusive owner of, such Intellectual Property or (B) has obtained
licenses to such third-party Intellectual Property sufficient for the conduct
of the business of the Company as currently conducted and as is now proposed

material respects have been taken, including payment of applicable
registration, maintenance and renewal fees, filing of applicable statements of
use, timely response to office actions and disclosure of any required
information, and all assignments (and licenses where required). To the
Companys Knowledge, all patents and patent applications within the Company IP
list the correct inventorship. All material documents, recordations and
certificates in connection with such Registered IP have been filed with
the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities in the United
States or non-U.S. jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of
prosecuting, maintaining and perfecting such Registered IP. Section 4.15(f) of

material actions that must be taken within 120 calendar days of the date
hereof with respect to any of the Registered IP. To the Companys Knowledge,
the Company has complied in all material respects with all applicable notice
and marking requirements for the Registered IP. No inequitable conduct has

delivered to Parent complete and accurate copies of all applications, material
correspondence and other material documents related to each such item

or any of the Ancillary Documents nor the consummation of any of the
Transactions will, with or without notice or the lapse of time, result in or
give any other Person the right or option to cause or assert: (i) a loss of,
or Lien on, any Company IP, or any Company IP to cease to be valid and
enforceable rights of the Company; (ii) the release, disclosure or delivery of
any Company IP by any escrow agent or to any other Person; (iii) the grant,
assignment or transfer to any other Person of any license or other material
right or interest, such as an ownership interest or

other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments that the Company would
otherwise be required to pay. Except for Material IP Contracts expressly
identified in Section 4.15(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no
royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments payable by the Company to any
Person (other than salaries payable to employees, consultants and independent
contractors not contingent on or related to use of their work product) as a
result of the ownership, use, possession, license-in, license-out, sale,
marketing, advertising or disposition of any Company IP by the Company, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in any such royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments being
payable by Parent. Following the Closing, except for any payment obligations
expressly identified in Section 4.15(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
all Company IP will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by Parent
without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third-party.

IP, and, none of the Company IP is subject to any pending or threatened
outstanding Order, stipulation, proceeding, or notification, including any

infringing or has infringed on or misappropriated any Intellectual Property
of any third-party; and

(j) Except for Material IP Contracts expressly identified in Section
4.15(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not bound by any

SECTION 4.16 _Taxes_.

 

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns_. The Company has duly and timely filed
with the appropriate Governmental Authorities all Tax Returns required to be

taxation by that jurisdiction.

for all open tax years, and complete and accurate copies of all examination
reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the

control jointly the conduct and resolution of the portion of such Tax Contest

have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but
elects in writing not to do so, then Parent shall have the right to control
the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, _provided_ that, Parent shall
keep the Shareholders Representative informed of all developments on a timely
basis and Parent shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the Shareholders
indemnification obligations under this Agreement without Shareholders
Representative written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each
party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Tax Contest.

to the amount of any such Parent Claim against the Escrow Amount, or against
the Shareholders directly, as the case may be, with respect to such
settlement. In the event Parent is, directly or indirectly, conducting the

in the principal amount of up to 0.25% (one-quarter of one percent) (as
determined in the discretion of the Shareholders Representatives) of the

requested in the discretion of Shareholders Representative) no less than the
amount then necessary to replenish the Administrative Expense Account to $***
(*** dollars) or such higher amount as the Shareholders Representative may
deem necessary in his discretion, into an account established by and in the
name of the Shareholders Representative (the " _Administrative Expense
Account_ ") and (ii) to reduce the Closing Date Total Cash Consideration and
each Escrow Release, Development Milestone and Sales Earnout to be paid to
the Shareholders by such amount. The Shareholders agree that, to the extent
available, the Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to draw against
the Administrative Expense Account at any time and from time to time as and
when (A) the Shareholders Representative incurs any Damages indemnified by
the Shareholders as set forth in this _Article X_ , (B) any Damages are
otherwise due under this Agreement and (C) necessary or appropriate to pay
any costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Shareholders Representative

***Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked with 3
asterisks (***), has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. SECTION 12.03 _Release_. Each Shareholder shall be deemed to have,
and hereby does, unconditionally release and forever discharge the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, their Affiliates and their respective agents,
representatives, officers and directors, from (a) any and all obligations or
duties the Company might have to such Person and (b) any and all claims of
liability, whether legal or equitable, of every kind and nature, which such
Person ever had, now has or may claim against the Company in each case arising
out of facts or circumstances occurring at any time on or prior to the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that such release shall exclude
those claims, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and shall exclude, to
the extent applicable with respect to any Person who is a director, officer or
employee of the Company, (1) compensation and benefits not yet paid
(including any amounts payable in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions), (2) reimbursement for expenses incurred by any such Person in
the ordinary course of his or her employment which are reimbursable under the
Companys expense reimbursement policies, (3) accrued vacation, subject to the
Companys policies on accrual and carryforward, and (4) any remaining
obligations of the Company to indemnify any officer or director and certain
stockholders of the Company as provided in the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or the indemnification agreements identified in
Section 6.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt,
the foregoing release by certain Shareholders who are also members of ***
shall not constitute a release of rights or claims the latter may have against
the Company.

 

The terms and provisions of this _Section 12.03_ are specific terms of the
Transactions, and the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
by the Company Stockholders pursuant to the Stockholders Written Consent
shall constitute approval by such Company Stockholders, as specific terms of
the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of such Company Stockholders to be
bound by such terms and provisions. Parent and Merger Sub would not have
entered into this Agreement but for the terms and provisions of this _Section
12.03_.

 

SECTION 12.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced as a result
of any rule of law or public policy, all other terms and other provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the
greatest extent possible.

 

SECTION 12.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the
Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules and Exhibits and the other agreements
referred to herein (including the Ancillary Documents) and the Confidentiality
Agreement, comprises the entire agreement of the Parties, and all promises,
representations, understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to
the subject matter hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement
relied upon by all the Parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in
such Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits or such other
agreements and this Agreement,

***Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked with 3

and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.  including such Company Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and such
other agreements, supersedes any prior understandings, negotiations,
agreements or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof are binding
upon or enforceable against any Party hereto unless and until the same is
executed and delivered by all of the Parties hereto.

SECTION 12.06 _Successors and Assigns; Transferees_.

 

(a) All covenants and agreements and other provisions set forth in
this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the Parties hereto shall
bind, and inure to the benefit of, the successors (including any successor by
merger, consolidation or division), heirs and permitted assigns of such Party.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned by the Shareholders Representative or the Company without the prior
written consent of Parent, or assigned by Parent or Merger Sub without the
prior written consent of the Company (prior to the Closing) or the
Shareholders Representative (after the Closing), _provided_ , that Parent and
Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may, without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Company or the Shareholders Representative,
assign any of its rights, or delegate any of its obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent so long as Parent also remains obligated
for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and shall be
jointly and severally liable with the assignee hereunder. The Shareholders
Representative shall execute such acknowledgments of such assignments in such
forms as Parent or Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may from
time to time reasonably request. Any purported assignment or delegation of
rights or obligations in violation of this _Section 12.06_ is void and of no
force or effect.

 

(b) If Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation (or any successor
of either) sells, transfers, licenses, sublicenses or otherwise disposes of a
Product and/or the Company IP that attaches to such Product and/or the right
to develop and/or market a Product (a " _Transfer_ "), (i) it shall be
a condition of such Transfer that the Transferee assume in writing the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation hereunder and (ii)
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain jointly and severally liable to the Shareholders for
any and all Development Milestones and Sales Earnouts that may be owed by the
Transferee hereunder. Any subsequent Transfer by a Transferee shall be subject
to the same conditions.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the provisions
of paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the Parties acknowledge and understand that
the Shareholders shall be entitled to receive the Development Milestones and
the Sales Earnouts as contemplated by this Agreement and that it is the intent
of this Agreement that no reorganization or restructuring of, or other
similar transaction affecting, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of their
Affiliates, or a Transferee, however carried out (including, without
limitation, by way of merger, consolidation, division, sale or license of
assets), or, without limitation, any sale, transfer or other disposition of
all or part of the capital stock of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a
Transferee or any sale, license, sublicense or other disposition of the
Company IP that attaches to a Product

***Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked with 3
asterisks (***), has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.  shall have the effect of circumventing the obligation to make the foregoing
payments to the Shareholders.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, no inference shall be drawn, when
interpreting this Agreement, from the fact that a clause refers to Parent
solely (and/or solely Parent and/or an Affiliate and/or the Surviving
Corporation) and does not refer to the Surviving Corporation, an applicable
Affiliate of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and/or a Transferee, it being
the intent of this Agreement that all such entities shall have the obligation
to pay the Development Milestones and Sales Earnouts.

SECTION 12.07 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended
except in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties
hereto. The Shareholders Representative shall have the right to amend this
Agreement on behalf of the Shareholders so long as such amendment does not
adversely affect the indemnification obligations of the Shareholders and/or
the consideration payable to the Shareholders. Subject to the foregoing and
applicable Law, any provision of this Agreement may be amended prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that, after adoption of this Agreement by the
Company Stockholders and without their further approval, no amendment may be
made which under applicable Law requires such approval.

SECTION 12.08 _Waiver_. Each Party to this Agreement may: (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered
by the other Party or Parties pursuant hereto; or (c) waive compliance with
any of the agreements of the other Parties or conditions to such Parties
obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound
thereby. Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided
herein, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any Party of any such right, power or privilege, nor
any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right,
power or privilege. The failure of a Party to exercise any right conferred
herein within the time required shall cause such right to terminate with
respect to the transaction or circumstances giving rise to such right, but not
to any such right arising as a result of any other transactions or
circumstances.

SECTION 12.09 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement and all of
its conditions and provisions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing in this Agreement (except as provided in this _Section 12.09_),
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, including any
union or any employee or former employee of the Company, other than the
Parties hereto any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement or any provision hereof; _provided, however_ , that the Company

and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act

respect to _Section 6.03_ and the Parent Indemnified Parties and the
Shareholder Indemnified Parties not party hereto are entitled to the rights
and remedies of third-party beneficiaries with respect to _Article IX_.

SECTION 12.10 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably,
and in a manner for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, in
the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly,
each of the Parties hereto agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of the United States
or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter, in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in
equity.

 

SECTION 12.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claim or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by
the Law of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and to be
performed entirely in such State without regard to conflict of law
principles that would result in the application of any Law other than the Law
of the State of Delaware.

SECTION 12.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of
the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
the Transaction Documents delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment relating thereto, and each Party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally: (a) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts; (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court
or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, in such Federal court; (c)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court; and (d)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
Delaware State or Federal court. Each Party hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. Each Party hereto irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 12.02_. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any Party hereto to serve process in
any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 12.13 _Cumulative Remedies_. Subject to _Section 9.05_,
all rights and remedies of the Parties hereto are cumulative of each other
and of every other right or remedy any such Party may otherwise have at law or
in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not
prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or
remedies.
