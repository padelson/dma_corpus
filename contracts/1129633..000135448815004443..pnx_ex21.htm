executed by the Company in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the parties
hereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time"), and the
parties hereto shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL or other applicable Law in connection with the Merger.

liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. (a) At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall

or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the

ARTICLE II

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

  

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

  

  

SECTION 2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each a "Share"), other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
2.1(b) ("Cancelled Shares") and any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive $37.50 in cash (the "Merger Consideration") payable to
the holder thereof, without interest, upon surrender of such Shares in the
manner provided in Section 2.3, less any required withholding taxes;

  

  

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Parent and any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto; and

  

  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, with the same rights, powers and privileges as the stock so
converted (the "Converted Shares"). Immediately after the Effective Time, the
Converted Shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates, if any, representing shares of capital stock of Merger Sub shall
be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

  

  

SECTION 2.2 Treatment of Options, Restricted Shares and Stock Units . (a) The
Company shall provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
option to purchase Shares (an "Option") granted under any Company Stock Plan
that, in each case, is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled, and the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive from the Company or the Surviving Corporation at or
promptly following the Effective Time, in consideration for such cancellation,
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the number of
Shares previously subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share previously subject to
such Option, less any required withholding taxes (the "Option Consideration").
In the event the exercise price of any Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Option shall be cancelled without payment therefor.
The Option Consideration will be paid promptly (and in any event within ten
(10) business days) following the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Each Share granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant
to any Company Stock Plan (collectively, "Restricted Shares") which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free
of such restrictions as of the Effective Time and at the Effective Time the
holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II, be entitled to receive,
without interest, the Merger Consideration with respect to each such
Restricted Share, less any required withholding taxes.

  

  

(c) The Company shall provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan entitling the holder
thereof to Shares or cash equal to or based on the value of Shares (such
awards, collectively, "Stock Units") which, in each case, is outstanding as of
the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled by the
Company and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from the Company
or the Surviving Corporation at or promptly following the Effective Time, in
consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares previously subject to such
Stock Unit and (B) the Merger Consideration (or, if the Stock Unit provides
for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceed a specified
reference price, the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds
such reference price), less any required withholding taxes (the "Stock Unit
Consideration"). For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of any
performance-based Stock Units with respect to which the amount of the award is
contingent upon performance level achievement for performance periods
continuing after the Effective Time, the number of Shares subject to such
Stock Units shall be determined in accordance with the Company Plan governing
such performance-based stock units and as set forth in Section 2.2(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Stock Unit Consideration will be paid
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) business days) following the
Effective Time.

  

  

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company and the Compensation Committee of such board, as applicable, shall
adopt any resolutions and take any actions that may be necessary to terminate
each of the Company Stock Plans and to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 2.2.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

SECTION 2.3 Surrender of Shares. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company) with a bank or trust company to act as transfer
agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the
"Paying Agent") to receive the Merger Consideration to which the stockholders
of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.3(b).
Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided that (a) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of Common Stock and following any losses which result in, as of
the time of such losses, an excess of (i) the Merger Consideration
attributable to the outstanding Common Stock over (ii) the aggregate amount of
such funds, Parent shall promptly provide or cause to be provided additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company
in the amount of such excess and (b) such investments shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30
days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced
by such investments will be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent and will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) an
outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii) Shares
represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares"), a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such
Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (less any required withholding taxes) and
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall then be canceled. No interest shall
be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by, and in accordance with, this Section
2.3, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares representing Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II.

  

  

(c) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the
terms of this Article II in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares represented thereby. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at
such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation
for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article II.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of
Shares pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax
Laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and are paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be.

  

  

(f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holder's making of an affidavit of that fact (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) and compliance with
any reasonable replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent,
including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article
II.

SECTION 2.4 Dissenting Shares. (a) Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have
properly demanded their appraisal rights with respect to such Shares in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and who have not withdrawn such demand
or consented to or voted in favor of this Agreement (the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL); provided,
however, that if any such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or
shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholder's rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholder's Dissenting Shares shall be treated
as if they had been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled
to the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 2.1
of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice received by
the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any Shares, withdrawals of
such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order,
decree, ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any
payment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or offer to
settle or settle any such rights or offer or commit to do any of the
foregoing.

  

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, (i)
except as set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
Company to the Parent and Merger Sub prior to, or concurrently with, the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), it being
understood and agreed that each item in a particular section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule applies only to the corresponding section of this
Agreement and to any other section of this Agreement to which its relevance is
reasonably apparent on its face and (ii) except as disclosed in the SEC
Reports filed with, or furnished to, the SEC subsequent to December 31, 2013
and prior to the date of this Agreement, and then (x) only to the extent
reasonably apparent in such SEC Reports that such disclosed item is an event,
item or occurrence that relates to a matter covered by a representation or
warranty set forth in this Article III and (y) other than in risk factors or
other forward-looking statements or language in such filings:

  

  

SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. Each of the Company
and its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing)
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its formation or organization, as
applicable, and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties, assets and rights and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where any such failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power or authority has
not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for any such failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing
which has not had or would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has
heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as
amended to date (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), and the bylaws (the
"Bylaws") of the Company as currently in effect. The Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company and the Bylaws are in full force and effect and
no other organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the
Company. The Company is not in violation of any provisions of its Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws.

  

  

SECTION 3.3 Capitalization.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000
shares of Common Stock and (ii) 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). As of September 28, 2015, (i)
5,750,880 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which
were validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free of
preemptive rights, (ii) no shares of Preferred Stock were outstanding and
(iii) an aggregate of 40,152 Common Shares were subject to or otherwise

of outstanding Options issued pursuant to the Company's Stock Incentive Plan,
2003 Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit and Long-Term Incentive Plan and
Directors Stock Plan, each as amended and restated through the date hereof
(collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"). From the close of business on
September 28, 2015 until the date of this Agreement, no options to purchase
shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock have been granted and no shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock have been issued, except for Shares issued
pursuant to the exercise of Options in accordance with their terms. There are
no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other securities ("Voting Debt")
the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for the right to vote) with the holders of any
class of securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries on any matter
submitted to such holders of such securities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(a), as of the date of this Agreement,
(A) there are not outstanding or authorized any (I) shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of the Company, (II) securities of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares
of capital stock or voting securities (including any Voting Debt) of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or (III) options, warrants, calls,
preemptive rights, subscriptions, agreements, arrangements or commitments of
any kind or other rights to acquire from the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and no obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
issue, transfer or sell any capital stock, voting securities (including Voting
Debt) or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for
capital stock or voting securities (including Voting Debt) of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or obligation to grant, extend or enter into any of
the foregoing items (collectively, "Company Securities"), (B) there are no
outstanding obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Company Securities, (C) there are no other options, calls,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party, (D) there are no voting trusts, proxies or other similar agreements or
understandings to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is
bound with respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock or voting
securities of the Company and (E) there are no contractual obligations or
commitments of any character restricting the transfer of, or requiring the
registration for sale of, any shares of capital stock or voting securities of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (other than limitations on transfer
under applicable Law). Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
of the Company's subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and all such shares are owned by the Company or another
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as indicated in Section 3.3 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and are owned free and clear of all security
interests, liens, adverse claims, pledges, limitations in voting rights,
charges or other encumbrances (other than limitations on transfer under
applicable securities or insurance Law). The authorized, issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of and other voting or equity interests in
all subsidiaries of the Company, the respective jurisdictions of formation of
such subsidiaries and the Company's direct or indirect ownership interest in
such subsidiaries are identified in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The Company has made available to Parent complete copies of the
organizational documents of each of the Company's subsidiaries as currently in
effect, and no such subsidiary of the Company is in violation of any provision
of its organizational documents except for any violation that has not had and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.4 Authority. The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and (assuming the Company Requisite Vote is received) to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and, assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.3, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated (other than
the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of at least a majority in voting
power of the outstanding Shares (the "Company Requisite Vote") and the filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of
Merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). As of the
date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i)
approved, and declared advisable, this Agreement, (ii) determined that the
terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders and (iii) recommended that the stockholders of the Company adopt
this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section
4.3, the only vote of the stockholders of the Company required to adopt this
Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby is the Company
Requisite Vote.

  

  

SECTION 3.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not and will not
(i) conflict with or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company or of any of its subsidiaries, (ii) assuming that all consents,
approvals and authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through (vii) of
subsection (b) below have been obtained, and all filings described in such
clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or by which its or any of their respective properties, rights or assets are
bound or (iii) conflict with, result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, give rise to
any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, or give
rise to any other material right of a counterparty or any other material
liability or obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit
or other instrument or obligation (each, a "Contract") to which the Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or its or any of their respective properties, rights and assets
are bound, or of any Licenses, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii),
for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, loss, right, liability,
obligation or other occurrence which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect or (y)
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange)
authority, agency, court commission or other federal or state governmental
body (each, a "Governmental Entity"), except for (i) applicable requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including the filing of the
Proxy Statement), the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR Act"), and state securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws,
(ii) the applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"),
(iii) the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, (iv) consents, authorizations,
approvals or filings with Governmental Entities pursuant to the applicable
provisions of U.S. Laws relating to the regulation of broker-dealers,
investment advisers, investment companies, commodity pool operators and
commodity trading advisors set forth on Section 3.5(b)(iv) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (together, the "Broker-Dealer Approvals"), (v) the filings
in respect of, and approvals and authorizations of the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Connecticut and the Department of Financial Services
of the State of New York (the "Designated State Insurance Approvals"), (vi)
such other filings in respect of, and to the extent necessary, approvals and
authorizations of, and, as applicable, the expiration of applicable waiting
periods of, the respective state commissioners of insurance or other similar
state authorities to satisfy applicable state insurance ownership, control,
competition or licensing Laws, and (vii) any other such consent, approval,
authorization, permit, action, filing or notification, the failure of which to
make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto and all documents incorporated by reference
therein) required to be filed by it with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 2012 (all such forms, reports,
statements, certificates and other documents filed since January 1, 2012, as
such may have been amended or supplemented since the time of filing,
collectively, the "SEC Reports"). Each of the SEC Reports complied (or, with
respect to any SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to

regulations promulgated thereunder and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date so

supplement prior to the date hereof), any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Since

Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule
3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) included in the SEC Reports when filed (but after
giving effect to any amendment or supplement prior to the date hereof) have
been (or, with respect to SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will be)
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in all
material respects applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
(or, with respect to SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly
present) in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated statements of income and operations, cash flows and changes in
stockholders' equity for the periods indicated. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Company (including any related notes thereto)
contained in the SEC Reports (when filed, or, if amended or supplemented, then
on the date of such amended or supplemented filing) have been (or, with
respect to SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will be) prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in all material
respects applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present (or, with respect
to SEC Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present) in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
statements of income and operations and cash flows for the periods indicated
(subject to normal period-end adjustments).

  

  

(c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"), the Company has been and is in compliance with (A) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE, except (x) with
respect to the Restatement Exceptions, as to which the Company is giving no
representation or warranties and (y) any such noncompliance which has not had
and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the Company or its
auditors have disclosed, based on such person's most recent evaluation prior
to the date of this Agreement, to the audit committee of the Company's Board
of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which any
such person has knowledge of and which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of a nature (whether absolute or contingent and whether or not
accrued and whether or not due, or to become due) required by generally
accepted accounting principles to be reflected, accrued or reserved against in
a consolidated balance sheet, except liabilities that (i) are accrued or
reserved against in the most recent audited financial statements included in
the SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or are reflected in
the notes thereto, (ii) were incurred in the ordinary course of business since

provisions for all actuarial Reserves and related items required to be
established in accordance with applicable Law, except in each case for any

Letter. The aggregate proceeds from the Equity Financing constitute all of the

contemplated by this Agreement at Closing, including the payment of the Merger
Consideration and the payment of all associated costs and expenses to be paid
by Parent and Merger Sub at Closing. The Equity Commitment Letter contains all
of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to
make the Equity Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. Parent's

conditions regarding Parent's, Merger Sub's or any other person's ability to

class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have

holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to
approve this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

the SEC advises the Company that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement, the Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall (i) take
all action necessary to duly set a record date for and duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of adopting
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger (the "Stockholders Meeting"),
with such record date to be selected with the consent of Parent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting, with the date of the Stockholders Meeting, subject to
the Company's rights pursuant to Section 6.1(b), to be no more than thirty
(30) days after the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company's

withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Requisite Vote (except to the extent that the Company has
effected a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.1(c)). The
Company shall keep Parent and Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy
solicitation results. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall, except as provided in Section 6.1(c), directly or
indirectly, withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Recommendation or otherwise make any
public statement inconsistent with the Recommendation (any such action or any
resolution or agreement to take any such action being referred to as a "Change
of Recommendation"); it being understood that any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act (other than
any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or a statement that contains both an
express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal and an express
reaffirmation to its stockholders in favor of the Merger) shall be deemed to
be a Change of Recommendation and neither the Company nor the Board of
Directors of the Company may effect a Change of Recommendation except in
accordance with Section 6.1(c); provided, however, that nothing in this
Agreement will prohibit accurate disclosure by the Company (and such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation by the
Company) of (x) factual information regarding the business, financial
condition or results of operations of Parent or the Company or (y) the fact
that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making
such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal
in the Proxy Statement or otherwise, to the extent the Company in good faith
determines that such information, facts, identity or terms is required to be
disclosed under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, the obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall
not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal or by a Change of
Recommendation.

  

  

(b) Subject to applicable Law and the following proviso, the Company shall not
adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting without Parent's consent (which
may be withheld in its sole discretion); provided that, without Parent's
consent, the Company may, adjourn or postpone the Stockholders Meeting up to
two (2) times (for a period of not more than thirty (30) calendar days in the

reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent the

represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting or (iv) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and dissemination (and review by the
Company's stockholders) of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company has determined in good faith is necessary to be filed and disseminated
under applicable Law prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has
established a record date for the Stockholders Meeting with the consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company
shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (including,
in the event that the Stockholders Meeting is adjourned or postponed in
accordance with this Section 6.1(b)), unless required to do so by applicable
Law.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote:

  

  

(i) If the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
any person that has not been withdrawn and, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and financial advisors (including at least one financial advisor
who is not, and whose affiliates are not, proposing to provide debt or equity
financing in connection with such Acquisition Proposal), the Company's Board
of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company's Board of Directors may make a
Change of Recommendation if and only if (A) the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisors (including at least one financial advisor who
is not, and whose affiliates are not, proposing to provide debt or equity
financing in connection with such Acquisition Proposal), that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; (B) the Company has given Parent its prior written notice of its
intention to consider making a Change of Recommendation at least five (5)
business days prior to making any such Change of Recommendation (a
"Determination Notice") (which notice shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation); and (C) (1) the Company shall have provided to Parent the
identity of the offeror, the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal and copies of all Acquisition Proposal Documentation, (2) the Company
shall have given Parent the five (5) business days after the Determination
Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another
proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have
negotiated with Parent in good faith during such five (5) business day period,
and (3) after considering the proposals made by Parent during such five (5)
business day period, if any, and after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and financial advisors (including at least one financial advisor
who is not, and whose affiliates are not, proposing to provide debt or equity
financing in connection with such Acquisition Proposal), the Company's Board
of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make the Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this Section 6.1(c)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the
references to five (5) business days shall be deemed to be three (3) business
days. The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment
to this Agreement or unless required to be disclosed in any filings with, or
Laws of, the SEC or pursuant to the rules of the NYSE; and

(ii) Other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company's
Board of Directors may make a Change of Recommendation in response to a Change
in Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company's Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (B) the Company shall have provided to Parent:
(1) a description in reasonable detail of the Change in Circumstance and (2) a
Determination Notice at least five (5) business days prior to making any such
Change of Recommendation, and if requested by Parent, the Company shall
negotiate with Parent in good faith during such five (5) business day period;
and (C) after considering any proposed revisions to this Agreement made by
Parent during such five (5) business day period, if any, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, the Company's Board of Directors shall have
determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Change of
Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. "Change in
Circumstances" shall mean any material event or development or material change
in circumstances (that does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal) with
respect to the Company that was not known to, and was not reasonably
foreseeable by (or, if known or reasonably foreseeable, the magnitude or
material consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable by),
the Company's Board of Directors or any Executive Officer of the Company as of
or prior to the date hereof which becomes known prior to the time at which the
Company Requisite Vote is obtained.

  

  

SECTION 6.2 Proxy Statement.

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(and in any event no later than twenty (20) business days following the date
hereof), the Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare and file
with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto and Parent and its counsel shall be given a

regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with

promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading. The Company shall
as soon as reasonably practicable (i) notify Parent of the receipt of any
comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy Statement
or for additional information and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all
written correspondence between the Company and its employees and other
authorized Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement, and shall promptly inform Parent of any
such correspondence conducted orally. If at any time prior to the Stockholders
Meeting, any event should occur which is required by applicable Law to be set

resignation of all Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries specified by
Parent in writing reasonably in advance of the Closing (but in no event less
than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date), in each case,
effective at the Effective Time.

  

  

SECTION 6.4 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) From the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, upon reasonable prior notice, the
Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
subsidiaries, officers, Directors and employees to, afford the officers,
employees, auditors and other authorized Representatives of Parent reasonable
access during normal business hours to its officers, employees, properties,
offices, and other facilities and to all books and records, and shall promptly
furnish Parent with all financial, operating and other data and information
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the work papers of the Company's
auditors to the extent Parent has executed a release in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company's auditors) as Parent, through its officers,
employees or authorized Representatives, may from time to time reasonably
request in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its clients, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company
or its subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
officers, employees, auditors and other authorized Representatives to hold and

its subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 1, 2015, by and between the Company and
Nassau Reinsurance LLC and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 21, 2015,
by and between the Company and Golden Gate Private Equity, Inc. (together, the
"Confidentiality Agreements") which Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms. The Confidentiality
Agreements shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.5 Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) The Company agrees that (i) it and its Executive Officers and Directors
shall not, (ii) its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries' executive officers and
Directors shall not and (iii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that its and its subsidiaries' respective agents and representatives
("Representatives") shall not, (A) directly or indirectly, solicit or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any Acquisition Proposal
or any proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) directly or indirectly enter into, maintain, participate in or
continue any negotiations or discussions with any person concerning, or
provide access to its properties, books and records or any confidential
information or data to any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or to
any proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (C) engage in discussions with any person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than to clarify the terms of the Acquisition
Proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions to consummation so
as to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that such
Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, or pursuant to clause (iv) below), (D) adopt, approve, recommend or
publicly propose to recommend, or agree to any Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Proposal Documentation or (E) resolve, propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing. The Company agrees that it will, and it will cause its
subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, (x) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or the destruction of, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement and to
the extent the Company is entitled to have such information returned or
destroyed, confidential information previously furnished by the Company, its
subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives to any such person in
connection with the consideration of any Acquisition Proposal and (y) cause
any physical or virtual data room to no longer be accessible to any such
person in connection with the consideration of any Acquisition Proposal other
than the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates and Representatives.
The Company shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries not to, release or
permit the release of any person from, waive or permit the waiver of any right
under, fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any consent or make any
election under, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement with
any person to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, unless
the Board determines after consultation with its outside legal advisors that
the failure to release, waive, enforce, grant a consent or make an election
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. The
Company shall (I) promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal (or any request for information, discussions or negotiations for
access to the properties or books and records of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or other inquiry that the Company reasonably believes could have
a reasonable possibility of resulting in an Acquisition Proposal) after the
date of this Agreement, which notice shall include the identity of the person
making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms thereof and a copy of any
Acquisition Proposal Documentation received by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives in connection
therewith and (II) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and details
(including any material developments with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal). Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of any material change to the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from: (i) taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer
or exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure to
stockholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, provided that any such
disclosure that constitutes a Change of Recommendation shall not be made
unless the Company has complied in all material respects with Section 6.1(c);
(ii) prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in
discussions with any person who has made after the date hereof an unsolicited
bona fide Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely for the
purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and any material terms thereof
and the conditions to consummation so as to determine whether there is a
reasonable possibility that such Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal; (iii) prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote, and after providing Parent with at least one (1)
business day prior notice, providing access to its properties, books and
records and providing confidential information or data in response to a
request therefor by a person who has made after the date hereof an unsolicited
bona fide Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the
person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreements (except for changes specifically necessary in order for the Company
to be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and it being
understood that the Company may enter into a confidentiality agreement without
a standstill provision or with a standstill provision less favorable to the
Company if it waives or similarly modifies the standstill provision in the
Confidentiality Agreements to the extent not already released pursuant to
Section 6.12, and in no event shall the Company following the date hereof
agree, in such confidentiality agreement or otherwise to reimburse any
expenses incurred by such person in connection with their review of such
information or any Acquisition Proposal), and (iv) prior to obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote, contacting and engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with any person who has made after the date hereof an unsolicited
bona fide Acquisition Proposal (which negotiations or discussions are not
solely for clarification purposes) (and, if applicable in connection
therewith, waive or modify any "standstill" or similar agreement), if and only
to the extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (iii) or (iv), the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors
(including at least one financial advisor who is not, and whose affiliates are
not, proposing to provide debt or equity financing in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal) that, (x) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and
(y) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and following any such determination,
the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed as to the status, details
and substance of any such negotiations or discussions.

  

  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer by a person or group
(other than a proposal by Parent or any of its affiliates) with respect to (x)
a tender offer or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or
other business combination involving the Company and/or its subsidiaries or
(y) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner (1) 20% or more of the
equity interests (measured by economic or voting power) in the Company on a
consolidated basis, or (2) 20% or more of the assets or liabilities of the
Company on a consolidated basis (including through reinsurance) or to which
20% or more of the revenues of the Company and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis are attributable, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean any Acquisition Proposal obtained from any
person or group, to acquire 75% of the outstanding equity interests in the
Company or 75% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, which is on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company
determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
and financial advisors (including at least one financial advisor who is not,
and whose affiliates are not, proposing to provide debt or equity financing in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal), (i) that if consummated, would be
more favorable to the Company and its stockholders from a financial point of
view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is
reasonably likely of being consummated, taking into account all such factors
as the Board of Directors of the Company considers to be appropriate
(including financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal, including any conditions to consummation, the likely timing of
consummation and whether such Acquisition Proposal contemplates reinsurance of
any of the liabilities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to an
affiliate of such person or group).

SECTION 6.6 Employment and Employee Benefits Matters.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain the severance-related provisions
of existing Company Plans and to provide 100% of the severance payments and
benefits required thereunder to be provided any Company Employee with respect
to those individuals who are active employees of the Company as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") who are terminated
during that twelve (12) month period.

 

  

  

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Continuing Employee may
have under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
each of its subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for any Continuing
Employee during his or her employment (i) compensation levels (such term to
include salary and wages, target short-term bonus opportunities and commission
formulas but to exclude long-term cash compensation, equity or equity-based
compensation and change-in-control benefits or features) that are in the
aggregate no less favorable than the compensation levels provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits (and the costs thereof) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided however, subject to the
foregoing, that nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of
any Company Plan or subject to Section 6.6(a) interfere with the Surviving
Corporation's right or obligation to make such changes.

  

  

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes
of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accruals other
than determining the levels of vacation pay and severance pay, and not to the
extent this credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of service), under any employee compensation and incentive plans,
benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements
maintained for the benefit of Continuing Employees as of and after the
Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for
the Continuing Employees' service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their
predecessor entities (each, a "Parent Plan"), in each case in which the
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time or is eligible or commences to participate in at
any time following the Effective Time, to the same extent recognized by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent
Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
the Parent or its subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-
existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing Employees
under similar plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will honor, and will cause its
subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (y) each employment,
change in control, severance and termination protection plan, policy or
agreement of or between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any
officer, Director or employee of that company, in each case in effect as of
the Effective Time and (z) all obligations pursuant to outstanding restoration
plans, equity-based plans, programs or agreements, bonus plans or programs,
bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits under any employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its subsidiaries and similar
employment compensation and benefit arrangements and agreements in effect as
of the Effective Time; provided however, that subject to Section 6.6(a),
nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan
or interfere with the Surviving Corporation's right or obligation to make such
changes.

  

  

(e) In the event that the Closing occurs during 2015, all fiscal year 2015
bonus amounts under annual bonus cash incentive plans of the Company and its
subsidiaries, will be calculated consistent with past practice and paid in the
ordinary course of business. Such fiscal year 2015 bonus amounts shall be paid
in the ordinary course of business but no later than March 15, 2016 (and, so
long as an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries was employed as of the
Closing Date and was not thereafter terminated for "cause", without regard to
whether such employee is employed on the payment date). In the event that such
fiscal year 2015 bonuses are paid prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with a list of the individual proposed bonus awards at least
five (5) business days prior to paying such bonuses and, to the extent that
any proposed bonus awards are discretionary in nature, the Company shall
consider in good faith Parent's view with respect to such discretionary bonus
awards.

  

  

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries,
for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending ninety days
thereafter, to not effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those
terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 (together with any similar state or local law, "WARN") affecting in whole
or in part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or Continuing
Employee, without complying with all provisions of WARN.

  

  

(g) This Section 6.6 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.6,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.6.
Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this Section 6.6 shall create
any third party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing
herein shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any Company Plan.

  

  

SECTION 6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former
officer, Director or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and
any fiduciary under any Company Plan (in each case, when acting in such
capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Actions, inquiries or investigations (whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), arising out of or
pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer,
Director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby) whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (a "Proceeding") to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law (and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) business days of receipt by
Parent from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor, shall advance
reasonable expenses in connection with any Proceeding as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; provided that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification). In the event
of any Proceeding, (x) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Action (and
in which indemnification could be sought by Indemnified Parties hereunder),
whether pending or threatened, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and
(y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of such matter.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that this Section 6.7 does not
purport to limit any rights that any Indemnified Party may have under any
employment agreement or Company Plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present Directors and
officers than are set forth in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to) obtain and fully pay, at no expense to the beneficiaries, for "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to
Directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), for the persons who are covered by the
Company's existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Company's existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby), and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain such DandO Insurance in full force and effect
for their full terms. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective
Time for the persons who are covered by the Company's DandO Insurance in place
as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or, if such insurance is
unavailable, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase the best available DandO Insurance for such
six-year period from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to the
Company's existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and with
levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and provided
further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other
entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and this Section 6.7.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective successors, heirs and legal Representatives, shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall
not be amended in any matter that is adverse to the Indemnified Parties
(including their successors, heirs and legal Representatives) without the
consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, heirs and legal
Representatives) affected thereby.

  

  

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.7 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or laws, and Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  

  

SECTION 6.8 Further Action; Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event
within fifteen (15) business days of the date of this Agreement and to supply
as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take
all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents
required from third parties (including pursuant to the Material Contracts) in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.8(a)
to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law,
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice (the "DOJ"), or any other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and
consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC,
the DOJ, or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent

respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if
any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ,
or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging
any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law
or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, the Company shall not
be required to take any action which is not conditioned on the Closing

(d) Subject to the obligations under Section 6.8(c) and Section 6.8(e), in the
event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, (i) each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
Parent and Merger Sub must defend, at their cost and expense, any action or
actions, whether judicial or administrative, in connection with the

Regulatory Authority; provided further, that the Company shall not be required
to take any action which is not conditioned on the Closing occurring.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to prepare all filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, clearances, waivers, approvals and authorizations of
all applicable Governmental Entities and other Persons necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Insurance Laws,
including each of the consents, authorizations, approvals or filings required
pursuant to Section 3.5(b)(iv), Section 3.5(b)(v) and Section 3.5(b)(vi)
(together, the "Regulatory Filings and Approvals"), and the Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent in making such filings. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide each other with copies of any written comments and advise the other
party of any oral comments with respect to the Regulatory Filings and
Approvals from each applicable Governmental Entity. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any Regulatory Filing and Approval, and
on any amendment or supplement thereto and each will provide the other with a
copy of all such filings made. The parties understand and agree that
"reasonable best efforts" shall include all things necessary to obtain the
Regulatory Filings and Approvals prior to the Termination Date; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (x)
Merger Sub and Parent shall not be required to agree to any Burdensome
Condition and the Company shall not be required to take any action which is
not conditioned on the Closing occurring and (y) nothing in this Agreement
shall require either the Company or Parent to be required to provide the other

contain personal information (including personal financial information) about
an officer, Director or control person of such party or (iii) are legally
privileged.

  

  

(f) A "Burdensome Condition" shall mean any requirement by any Governmental
Entity that requires any of the Fund, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
of their respective affiliates to (A)(1) offer, sell or hold separate pending
divesture, or agree to offer, sell or hold separate pending divestiture or (2)
consent to any offer, sale, holding separate pending divestiture or agreement
to offer, sell or hold separate pending divestiture, in either case, before or
after the Closing, of any businesses, operations or assets, or interests in
any businesses, operations or assets, of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates or (B) take or agree to take any other action or agree
or consent to any limitation or restriction on or changes in any such
businesses, operations or assets of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective affiliates that, individually or in the aggregate, are materially
adverse to the combined businesses of Parent, the Company and their respective
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the Closing or to the Fund, other
than any such action, consent, limitation, restriction or change set forth on
Section 6.8(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

SECTION 6.9 Public Announcements. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the
final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

  

  

SECTION 6.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Shares (including

under such rule and result from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each Director or officer of the Company who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company.

  

  

SECTION 6.11 Filing of SEC Reports and Proxy Statement. Following the date
hereof, the Company shall and shall cause its applicable subsidiaries to, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC, as soon as
reasonably practicable, all SEC Reports required to be filed following the
date hereof, such that the Company and its applicable subsidiaries are each
timely and in good standing with respect to all filings with the SEC required
under applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 6.12 Release Under Confidentiality Agreement; State Takeover Laws. The
Company hereby releases Parent and Merger Sub from the "standstill" provisions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreements to the extent necessary to
negotiate and enter into this Agreement and to the extent necessary for Parent
and Merger Sub to avail themselves of their rights under Section 6.5. If any
"fair price," "business combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or
other similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Board of
Directors will use their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and will otherwise act to minimize the effects
of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

SECTION 6.13 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in, at its own cost and expense, the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or any of its
Directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether commenced prior to or
after the date hereof; provided that Parent shall have the right to consent to
the outside counsel (other than Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP and Richards,
Layton and Finger P.A., as to which consent is given hereby) engaged by the
Company to defend any such litigation. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company
shall not (a) settle or offer to settle any such litigation, (b) indemnify any
person against any costs, expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities incurred in connection with any such litigation, or provide to
any person advancement of expenses in connection with any such litigation, in
each case except as required by the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of

date hereof or (c) authorize, commit, resolve, propose or agree to take any of
the actions described in clause (a) or (b) above.

oral notification the Company receives from any Governmental Entity or the
Company's auditors with respect thereto, (c) inform Parent of any proposed
revision to the Remediation Plan (including as a result of the Company's
compliance with this Section 6.14), and (d) consider in good faith the views,
comments and proposals of Parent with respect to the foregoing clauses (a),
(b) and (c) and implement any change in accounting policies or procedures or
the application or implementation thereof, to the extent such change is in
furtherance of the Remediation Plan; provided that the Company shall not be
obligated to take any action that its third party independent accountants
reasonably advise against. The members of the Transition Committee appointed

controls committee of the Company and shall be given reasonable advance notice
of any such meetings, together with copies of all written materials given to
members of such committee.

  

  

SECTION 6.15 Transition Committee. Promptly after the date hereof, Parent and
the Company shall form a transition committee (the "Transition Committee"),

Company's business to be conducted from and after the Closing, including (i)
the retention of Company Employees and (ii) remediation and improvements of
Company controls and accounting procedures, (c) arrive at a mutually
acceptable defense of any Action pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (d) discuss and
monitor certain other compliance policies and procedures of the Company and
its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing,
the Parties do not intend for Parent to control the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing and no action otherwise required
under this Section 6.14, Section 6.15 and Section 6.16 shall be required to be
taken if such action would be reasonably likely to violate applicable Law. The
Transition Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives
of Parent and the Company and shall meet with such frequency as the Transition
Committee shall deem appropriate, either through in-person meetings or
telephone conference.

  

  

SECTION 6.16 Investment Assets. From and after the date hereof, (a) at any

or disposition of any Investment Asset and (b) at any time following the
Condition Satisfaction, in addition to taking those actions set forth on
Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall purchase or
dispose of any Investment Asset reasonably requested by Parent. In purchasing

reasonable best efforts to cause the trustee of each Benefit Protection Trust
to, take all actions necessary to effectuate Forms of Amendment prior to the
Closing.

  

  

(b) The Company shall, at Parent's sole expense, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under the terms of the
Indenture or applicable Laws, as reasonably requested by Parent, to amend
Section 704(1) of the Indenture so as to read in its entirety as is set forth
in Exhibit C hereto (and such other amendments to the Indenture as are
reasonably necessary or desirable to give effect to such amendment) or to read
as otherwise mutually agreed between the Company and Parent; provided, that
none of the Company or its subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers,
directors, managers, members, employees, advisors, agents or representatives,
shall be required to agree to any contractual obligation relating to the
amendment to the Indenture that is not conditioned upon the Closing and that
does not terminate without liability to each such person upon the termination
of this Agreement. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, managers,
members, employees, advisors, agents and representatives, from and against any
and all liabilities or obligations suffered or incurred in connection with the
amendment to the Indenture or any assistance or activities provided in
connection therewith. If the Closing does not occur, Parent shall promptly
reimburse the Company for all documented out-of-pocket third party costs

directors, managers, members, employees, advisors, agents or representatives,
in connection with such cooperation, assistance or activities.

the Closing Date) for a waiver of the effects of a change of control of
Phoenix Life Insurance Company under such agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) be on terms that would not
reasonably be expected to be adverse in any material respect to the benefits
expected by the Company under such reinsurance agreement (such waiver or
amendment, the "Reinsurance Agreement Amendment"). If the Closing does not
occur, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for all documented out-of-
pocket third party costs incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries, and
their respective officers, directors, managers, members, employees, advisors,
agents or representatives, in connection with the Company's seeking to obtain

under review or that a change in such rating or outlook is being made or
considered, (b) inform Parent in advance of any meeting or discussion
scheduled with any such rating agency and (c) provide Parent with copies of

notwithstanding approval thereof by the stockholders of the Company:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

  

  

(b) by Parent or the Company if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity located or having jurisdiction within the United States
shall have issued a final order, decree or ruling or taken any other final
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such
order, decree, ruling or other action is or shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall have used its reasonable best efforts as
required by Section 6.8 to prevent, oppose and remove such order, decree,
ruling or other action and the issuance of such final, non-applicable order,
decree or ruling or other action was not primarily due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform in any material respect
any of its obligations under this Agreement;

  

  

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before the date which is nine (9) months from the date hereof
(the "Termination Date"); provided however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to the party
seeking to terminate if any action of such party (or, in the case of Parent,
Merger Sub) or the failure of such party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger
Sub) to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed at or prior to the Effective Time has been the primary cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the
Termination Date and such action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of
this Agreement; provided, further, that, on a date that would otherwise have
been the Termination Date, if any of (i) the conditions set forth in Section
7.1(c), Section 7.1(d) and/or Section 7.1(e), (ii) the condition set forth in
Section 7.2(d) (but only with respect to a Performance Default), and/or (iii)

actions taken at the Closing) that shall not have been satisfied or waived on
or before such date, either the Company or Parent may unilaterally extend the
Termination Date by up to three (3) months to enable such conditions to be
satisfied or waived, in which case the Termination Date shall be deemed for
all purposes to be such later date;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) by the Company if there shall have been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained
in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) or

incapable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub within thirty (30) calendar
days of written notice provided by the Company to Parent stating the Company's
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) (or if
less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the Termination Date, by the
Termination Date); provided that the Company shall have given such notice to
Parent at least ten (10) calendar days prior to such termination; provided
further that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if such breach can be remedied by the
Termination Date and Parent and Merger Sub are diligently pursuing a remedy of
such breach or the Company is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

  

  

(e) by Parent:

  

  

(i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement
such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) would
not be satisfied and, in either such case, such breach is incapable of being
cured by the Company within thirty (30) calendar days of written notice
provided by Parent to the Company stating Parent's intention to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)(i) (or if less than thirty (30)
calendar days prior to the Termination Date, by the Termination Date);
provided that Parent shall have given such notice to the Company at least ten
(10) calendar days prior to such termination; provided further that Parent
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(e)(i) if such breach can be remedied by the Termination Date and the
Company is diligently pursuing a remedy of such breach or Parent or Merger Sub
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

  

  

(ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof (A)
shall have made a Change of Recommendation or (B) following the receipt by the
Company of an Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or publicly made known to the stockholders of the Company
or generally disclosed to the stockholders of the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company has not publicly reaffirmed the Recommendation, and
fails to do so through a press release or similar means, within five (5)
business days after the date Parent requests in writing (which request can be
made no more than once with respect to each Acquisition Proposal) that the
Company so reaffirm the Recommendation; provided however, that Parent shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(e)(ii) if the Company Requisite Vote shall have been obtained;

  

  

(f) by either Parent or the Company if, upon a vote taken thereon at the
Stockholders Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof at which
quorum is present, this Agreement shall not have been adopted by the Company
Requisite Vote.

  

  

SECTION 8.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of any party hereto, except with respect to Section

on Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, Section 6.17(b), this
Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Article IX, and the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall survive such termination; provided however, that, subject to
Section 8.2(d), nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
fraud or any willful and material breach of this Agreement, in which case, the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in
equity.

  

  

(b) Company Termination Fee.

pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for any or no reason or either of
Parent or Merger Sub otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform any
of its covenants hereunder (in any case, whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise), except for the right of the Company to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to the extent
permitted by Section 9.10, the Company's and its affiliates' sole and
exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or

Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub's
obligations under Section 6.8 or (y) Parent has terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) in circumstances in which the Company has the right

shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Parent (a "Pre-Closing
Damages Proceeding"); provided that the monetary damages payable by Parent
under all Pre-Closing Damages Proceedings shall not exceed, in the aggregate,
$20,000,000 (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except for the right of the Company to seek and recover monetary
damages from Parent up to the amount of the Cap pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Section 8.2(d), any claims of the Company under the
Confidentiality Agreements and the ability of the Company to seek an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to the extent set
forth in Section 9.10, none of the Parent Parties will have any liability to
the Company or any of its affiliates or any other Person, whether at Law or
equity, in contract in tort or otherwise, arising from or in connection with
any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or arising
from any claim or cause of action that the Company or any of its affiliates
may have relating to matters contemplated by this Agreement (including a
failure to effect the Closing as and when required pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement), and no Person will have any rights or claims against any of
the Parent Parties relating to any such matters. In no event shall any of the
Company or any of its affiliates or any of their respective former, current or
future directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners,
managers, members, stockholders or affiliates seek or permit to be sought on
behalf of any such Person any damages from, or otherwise bring any claim or
proceeding against, any of the Parent Parties arising from or in connection
with any breach of this Agreement or any of the matters contemplated hereby,
other than a Pre-Closing Damages Proceeding when permitted and to the extent
set forth in this Section 8.2(d), under the Confidentiality Agreements or for
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, in each case,
to the extent set forth in Section 9.10. Nothing in this Section 8.2(d) shall
in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in
which Parent or any other Parent Party may be liable under this Agreement or
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. In the
event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee or the
Expense Reimbursement when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent for all
reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by Parent
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any
action (including the filing of any lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid to the date of actual payment.

(including Section 8.2(c)), each party shall bear its own expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

SECTION 8.4 Procedure for Termination or Amendment. In order for any amendment
or termination of this Agreement to be effective, such amendment or
termination requires approval of the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,
the Company or Merger Sub, as the case may be (or any authorized committee
thereof), if such action is to be taken at any time prior to the Effective
Time; provided however, that, after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which by Law requires
the further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval; provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, any termination
of this Agreement by a single party pursuant to Section 8.1 shall only require
the approval of the Board of Directors of such party. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

  

SECTION 8.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the

pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party
to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights
or remedies.

contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede the rights of
the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement; provided however, that

hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than (a) with respect to the provisions of
Section 6.7 which shall inure to the benefit of the persons or entities

holders of Common Stock pursuant to the foregoing clause (d) of this Section
9.6 shall only be enforceable on behalf of such holders by the Company (or any
successor in interest thereto) in its sole and absolute discretion, and may,
in the Company's sole and absolute discretion, be retained by the Company (or
any successor in interest thereto) for the use and benefit of the Company (or
any successor in interest thereto) on behalf of its stockholders in any manner
the Company (or such successor in interest) deems fit.

SECTION 9.10 Specific Performance.

  

  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
and the third party beneficiaries of the Agreement would not have any adequate
remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. The parties agree that they shall not object to the granting of
injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there exists an
adequate remedy at law. The parties further agree that (x) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this Section 9.10, a party shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a
party under this Agreement, including, subject to Section 8.2(d) and Section
8.2(e), monetary damages in the event that this Agreement is terminated or in
the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 9.10(a) are not
available or are otherwise not granted and (y) nothing in this Section 9.10(a)
shall restrict or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Article VIII or pursuant any other remedies that
may be available then or thereafter.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including Section
9.10(a)), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief or specific performance (x) with respect to Parent's
obligation to cause the Closing Commitment (as defined in the Equity
Commitment Letter) to be funded to fund the Merger and to cause Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with Article I,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, in
each case only in the event that each of the following conditions has been
satisfied: (i) this Agreement has not been validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1 and each of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section
7.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (ii) Parent and
Merger Sub fail to complete the Merger in accordance with Article I and (iii)
the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is granted
and the Closing Commitment (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter) is
funded, and Parent otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then the
Closing will occur and (y) to require Parent to cause all or a portion of the
Pre-Closing Damages Commitment (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter) to
be funded only (A) in the event that monetary damages have been awarded to the
Company pursuant to a Final Order, in each case in connection with a Pre-
Closing Damages Proceeding in accordance with Section 8.2 and (B) to the
extent of the monetary damages awarded pursuant to clause (A) above (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the Cap).

  

  

(c) The parties hereto have specifically bargained for the right to specific
performance hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Section 9.10.

  

  

SECTION 9.11 Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware, in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it
shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware, and (iv) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.2.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in
Section 9.2 shall be effective service of process for any suit or proceeding
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
