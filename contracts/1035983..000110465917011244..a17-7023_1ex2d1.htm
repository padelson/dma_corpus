 ** _STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This **Stock Purchase Agreement** (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February
21, 2017, is by and among Comfort Systems USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Purchaser_ "), BCH Holdings, Inc., a Florida corporation (the " _Company_ "),
the selling shareholders listed on **_Schedule 1_** hereto, (each individually
a " _Seller_ " and, collectively, the " _Sellers_ ") and Daryl W. Blume, in
his capacity as Representative of Sellers (the " _Sellers  Representative_").
Purchaser, the Company, the Sellers Representative and Sellers are sometimes
individually referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the "
_Parties_."

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Prior to the Closing and in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein, the Company intends to cause certain transactions to
occur whereby: (i) the Company will acquire all of the outstanding stock in
the BCH Affiliate Group, (ii) the BCH Affiliate Group shareholders will sell
their respective interests in the BCH Affiliate Group to the Company in
exchange for a proportionate share of stock in the Company (the "Stock"), and
(iii) each company in the BCH Affiliate Group will convert from a corporation
to a limited liability company (the " _Pre-Closing Reorganization_ ").

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , following the Pre-Closing Reorganization, each company in the
BCH Affiliate Group will be a Subsidiary of the Company (together with the
Company, the " _Acquired Companies_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the date hereof, Sellers own 100% of the Stock;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Purchaser desires to purchase from Sellers, and Sellers desire
to sell to Purchaser, all of the Stock upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein;

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a
material inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement, the Key Employees have each executed employment agreements, which
include noncompetition provisions, in the form attached as **_Exhibit F_**
(collectively, the " _Key Employee Employment Agreements_ "), all of such Key
Employee Employment Agreements being conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Parties have agreed to the sale and purchase of the Stock
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in **_Exhibit A_** attached hereto.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I _ 
PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING_**

 



 

Section 1.1. _Purchase and Sale of Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Sellers hereby sell, convey, transfer and deliver to
Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby purchases, all of the Stock, free and clear of
all Encumbrances.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Purchase Price_. In reliance on the representations, warranties
and agreements of Sellers contained herein, the aggregate purchase price for
the Stock (the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall equal an amount in cash calculated
as follows:

 



 

(a) Eighty-five million seven hundred thousand dollars and no cents
($85,700,000.00) in immediately available funds, plus

 



 

(b) The Note in the aggregate principal amount of fourteen million three
hundred thousand dollars and no cents ($14,300,000.00) in the form attached
hereto as **_Exhibit B_** (the " _Notes_ "), plus

 



 

(c) an Earn-Out (as defined below).

 



 

The Purchase Price shall be subject to post-closing adjustment as provided in
_Sections 1.3_ and _1.4_ below. Further, at the time and on the terms set
forth in the Earn-Out Agreement in the form attached as **_Exhibit C_** (the
" _Earn-Out Agreement_ "), Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the Earn-Out, if any
(as that term is defined in the Earn-Out Agreement). For the avoidance of
doubt, continued employment with the Company is not a requirement for Sellers
to receive any payments owed to the Sellers under the Earn-Out or Notes.

 



 

Section 1.3. _First Purchase Price Adjustment_. Following the Closing, and
after 75 days, Sellers shall undertake and prepare a look-back analysis that,
in accordance with GAAP, shall determine what the Acquired Companies Working
Capital was at Closing. The Sellers and Purchaser agree that the Working
Capital shall be calculated as set forth on **_Schedule 1.3_** attached
hereto. For clarity of the foregoing, this Working Capital calculation shall
take into account the final profit margins and performance on any reported
projects that deteriorated after the Closing as if these projects had been
reported with the lower margins as of Closing. Pursuant to this paragraph, the
Sellers shall provide Purchaser with its calculation of the Acquired
Companies Working Capital as of Closing, and shall explain its determination
to Purchaser of the Working Capital (the " _Sellers  WC Statement_").

 



 

(a) Following receipt of Sellers WC Statement, Purchaser shall either accept
Sellers WC Statement, which statement shall then be deemed the final
statement (" _Final WC Statement_ ") or certify to the Sellers its alternate
calculation of working capital (" _Purchaser s WC Statement_"). Purchaser and
Sellers shall then make good faith efforts to meet and resolve the differences
between the Sellers WC Statement and the Purchasers WC Statement. If within
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers of the Purchasers WC Statement,
Purchaser and Sellers have been unable to reach agreement, the Parties shall
engage the Resolving Accountant to determine which calculation of Working
Capital is more accurate, the Sellers WC Statement or the Purchasers WC
Statement, and shall certify the

 



      
 

 



 

Resolving Accountants choice as the Final WC Statement. The Resolving
Accountant shall certify this decision in writing to Purchaser and the
Sellers; the Resolving Accountant shall have no other choice but to select
either the Sellers WC Statement in its entirety or the Purchasers WC
Statement in its entirety. The Resolving Accountants determination shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The fees, costs, and expenses of the
Resolving Accountant, including any attorneys fees related thereto, shall be
borne by Sellers if the Purchasers WC Statement is selected by the Resolving
Accountant as most accurate and shall be borne by the Purchaser if the
Sellers WC Statement is selected by the Resolving Accountant as most
accurate.

 



 

(b) Once the Final WC Statement has been determined pursuant to subparagraph
(i) above, the following shall occur: (i) if the Final WC Statement reflects
Working Capital greater than the Required Working Capital, then Purchaser
shall pay each Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds its Pro
Rata Percentage of the amount equal to the surplus to the Sellers within ten
(10) Business Days; (ii) if the Final WC Statement reflects Working Capital
less than the Required Working Capital, then each Seller shall pay to
Purchaser an amount equal to such Sellers Pro Rata Percentage of the
shortfall by wire transfer in immediately available funds within ten (10)
Business Days.

 



 

(c) For clarification of the above, it is the intent of the Parties that at
the time the Stock is transferred to Purchaser the Working Capital shall be at
least equal to the Required Working Capital as of the Closing Date after
accounting for any job fade, and after performing the above described look-
back analysis. Furthermore, the Required Working Capital shall be reduced by
the following items: (i) unamortized purchase price for up to thirty (30) Ford
service vans ordered for March 2017 if the cost of such vans has been incurred
prior to the Closing, (ii) up to a maximum of seven hundred fifty thousand
dollars and no cents ($750,000.00) of mutually-agreed closing bonuses paid to
certain Company employees to be accrued prior to the Closing, (iii) the amount
by which the accrual for the Companys self-insured risk programs (which
includes General Liability, Workers Compensation, and Automobile) exceeds
$1,303,894, (iv) up to two hundred thousand dollars and no cents ($200,000.00)
of accounting fees accrued prior to Closing that are to be paid by the
Acquired Companies for audit work related to periods prior to the Closing;
_provided, however_ , that this subsection (iv) of _Section 1.3(c)_ shall not
include accounting fees for any accounting services provided to any Sellers in
their individual capacity. In the event that payments owed pursuant to this
_Section 1.3_ are not made within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date, interest shall begin to accrue on the amount outstanding at the
rate of five percent (5%) per annum until final payment is made.

 



 

Section 1.4. _Second Purchase Price Adjustment_. As promptly as practical
after the completion of all Contracts set forth on **_Schedule 3.28_** and any
other customer Contracts entered into before the close of business on the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _WIP Projects_ "), the Parties shall perform
an analysis (the " _WIP Analysis_ ") with respect to the WIP Projects. The

 



      
 

 



 

WIP Analysis shall show the amount (the " _WIP Adjustment_ ") by which the
Acquired Companies net earnings as of the Closing were overstated or
understated by reason of any improper accruals of revenue and expenses on the
WIP Projects as of the Closing (as if the final amounts had been known as of
the Closing). The WIP Adjustment shall be determined on an aggregate basis
netting out over and under accruals. The WIP Adjustment shall be calculated on
a contract-by-contract basis using the following formula:

 



 

    

WIP Adjustment

 |  

=

 |  

Final 
Revenue 
Earned

 |  

X

 |  

(

 |  

 _Cost to Date @ 
Closing Date_

 

Final Total Costs

 |  

)

 |  

-

 |  

Revenue 
Earned @ 
Closing Date

 |  

-

 |  

Any loss that 
would have been 
accrued as of 
Closing Date in 
accordance with 
GAAP 

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
 

 



 

For example, if at the Closing the Acquired Companies have earned $800,000 of
revenue and accrued $600,000 of expenses with respect to a particular project
and upon completion of the project, total revenue is $1,000,000 and total
costs are $650,000, the WIP Adjustment with respect to that project would be
positive $123,077, reflecting the additional margin that would have been
reflected as of the Closing. Also, for example, if at the Closing, the
Acquired Companies have recognized $800,000 of revenue and incurred $600,000
of expenses with respect to a particular project, and upon completion of the
project, total revenue earned is $1,000,000 and total expenses are $1,100,000,
the WIP Adjustment with respect to that project would be negative $300,000,
composed of $200,000 in margin that had been incorrectly recognized as of the
Closing plus $54,546 representing the amount of the loss that had been spent
before the Closing, plus $45,454 representing the amount of expected loss that
would have been accrued pursuant to GAAP as of the Closing for the project.

 



 

(a) Based on the WIP Analysis and within sixty (60) days after completion of
the WIP Projects, the Sellers Representative shall provide Purchaser with
Sellers calculation of the WIP Adjustment (the " _Proposed WIP Statement_ "),
and Purchaser shall either accept the Proposed WIP Statement, which will then
be deemed final and binding on the Parties, or provide to the Sellers
Representative Purchasers an alternate calculation of the WIP Adjustment (the
" _Purchaser s WIP Statement_"). If Purchaser fails to accept the Proposed
WIP Statement or deliver to the Sellers Representative Purchasers WIP
Statement within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Proposed WIP
Statement, the Proposed WIP Statement shall be final and binding on the
Parties.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall then make good faith
efforts to meet and resolve any differences between the Proposed WIP Statement
and Purchasers WIP Statement. If within thirty (30) days after receipt by the

Sellers Representative have been unable to reach agreement, such Parties
shall engage the Resolving Accountant to calculate the WIP Adjustment, and
shall direct the Resolving Accountant to make its determination within thirty
(30) days of its engagement. The WIP Adjustment determined by the Resolving
Accountant shall be final and binding on the Parties; _provided_ , that the
WIP Adjustment amount

 



      
 

 



 

calculated by the Resolving Accountant shall be either the WIP Adjustment
amount set forth in the Proposed WIP Statement or Purchasers WIP Statement.
The Resolving Accountant shall certify its decision in writing to Purchaser
and Sellers. The fees, costs and expenses of the Resolving Accountant shall be
borne by Sellers according to their Pro Rata Percentage if Purchasers WIP
Statement is determined by the Resolving Accountant as the most accurate, or
shall be borne by Purchaser if the Proposed WIP Statement is determined by the
Resolving Accountant as the most accurate.

 



 

(c) After the WIP Adjustment (the " _Final WIP Adjustment_ ") has been
determined as final and binding on the Parties, the following shall occur: If
the Final WIP Adjustment is a negative amount, each Seller will pay to
Purchaser an amount equal to such Sellers Pro Rata Percentage of such amount
by wire transfer in immediately available funds (as a positive number); or if
the Final WIP Adjustment is a positive amount, Purchaser shall pay each Seller
by wire transfer of immediately available funds its Pro Rata Percentage of the
total amount reflected by the Final WIP Adjustment.

 



 

(d) _Certain Definitions_ : As used herein, the following terms have the
following meanings:

 



 

(i) " _GAAP_ " means United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as

apply GAAP, on a good faith basis, in a way that would result in two different

past and current accounting practices shall be dispositive in determining how
to resolve the discrepancy.

 



 

" _Working Capital_ " means the Acquired Companies current assets minus
current Liabilities as calculated pursuant to GAAP and in accordance with the
Acquired Companies customary practices and as further set forth on

Companies have been timely filed. Such Tax Returns were correct and complete
in all respects and have been prepared in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements. All Taxes due and owing by or with respect to any Acquired
Company (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely paid in
full. With respect to the periods for which Tax Returns have not been filed,
each Acquired Company has established adequate reserves for the payment of all
Taxes. No Acquired Company is currently the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by an
authority in a jurisdiction where an Acquired Company does not file Tax
Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction or may
be required to file Tax Returns in that jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) No deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted, or assessed
against an Acquired Company and no request for waivers of the time to assess
any such Taxes has been requested, granted or are pending. No Acquired Company
is involved in or party to any audit, examination, deficiency, or refund
litigation or material matter in controversy with respect to any Taxes. All
Taxes due by each Acquired Company with respect to completed and settled
examinations or concluded litigation have been paid in full. No Acquired
Company has requested or executed an extension or waiver of any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or any Tax items, and no Acquired Company has
agreed to be or is the beneficiary of any extension of time with respect to a
Tax assessment or deficiency or any adjustment to a Tax Return that may be
made.

 



 

(c) None of the assets or properties of any Acquired Company is subject to any
Tax lien, other than such liens for Taxes that are not due and payable, or the
validity of which are being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings
and for which adequate provisions are being maintained in accordance with
GAAP.

 



 

(d) Each Acquired Company has: (i) collected and withheld all Taxes that are
required to be collected or withheld in connection with any amounts paid or
owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other
third party; (ii) properly classified any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder, or other third party for Tax purposes; and (iii) has
timely submitted and paid all such collected and withheld amounts to the
appropriate authorities. Each Acquired Company is in compliance with the
back-up withholding and information reporting requirements under: (i) the Code
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) all other
applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(e) No Acquired Company has any assets that may constitute unclaimed property
or escheat obligations under applicable law. Each Acquired Company has
complied in all material respects with all applicable unclaimed property and
escheat laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Acquired
Company has established and followed procedures to identify any unclaimed
property and, to the extent required by applicable law, remit such unclaimed
property to the

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Governmental Authority. Each Acquired Companys records are
adequate to permit a Governmental Authority or other outside auditor to
confirm the foregoing representations.

 



 

(f) The Company has been a validly electing S corporation within the meaning
of Code sections 1361 and 1362 at all times since its formation for U.S.
federal and applicable state Tax purposes (an " _S Corporation_ "), and the
Company will be an S corporation up to and including the Closing Date. Since
the effective date of the Companys election to be taxed in accordance with
Subchapter S of the Code, Sellers and Company have not taken any action or
failed to take any action that would result in the Company failing to qualify
pursuant to Subchapter S of the Code (including Code section 1361(b)(1)). Each
Acquired Company other than the Company has been an S Corporation at all times
since its formation, and will be an S Corporation upon consummation of the
Pre-Closing Reorganization. Thereafter, each Acquired Company will be a
qualified subchapter S subsidiary as defined in Code section 1361(b)(3)(B) and
then, upon converting to a limited liability company, a disregarded entity for
U.S. federal and applicable state Tax purposes. None of the Acquired Companies
has, in the past five (5) years, (i) acquired assets from another corporation
in a transaction in which its Tax basis for the acquired assets was
determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the Tax basis of the acquired
assets (or any other property) in the hands of the transferor or (ii) acquired
the stock of any corporation that is a qualified subchapter S subsidiary. The
Acquired Companies have no potential Liability for Tax under Code section 1374
or 1375 and will not be liable for any Tax under Code section 1374 in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
making of an election under Code section 338(h)(10)).

 



 

(g) Since the Balance Sheet Date, no Acquired Company has (i) made or altered
any Tax election, settled or compromised any Tax Liability, filed any amended
Tax Return or surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund, offset, or
other reduction in Tax Liability or (ii) accelerated or moved any Tax
deduction, attribute or benefit to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or deferred any
Tax detriment or taxable income to the Tax period ending after the Closing
Date.

 



 

(h) No Acquired Company thereof will be required to include any item of income
in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) "closing agreement" as
described in Code section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign income Tax law) executed at or prior to the Closing,
(ii) change in method of accounting pursuant to Code section 481 or similar
provision of state, local or foreign law made or applicable on or prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on
or prior to the Closing Date, (iv) prepaid amount received or paid on or prior
to the Closing Date, (v) election under Code section 108(i), or (vi) other
amount economically accrued on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) No Acquired Company has been a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group. No Acquired Company has any Liability for the Taxes
of any other Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), by operation of law, as a
transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

(j) No Acquired Company is party to or bound by any Tax allocation,
indemnification, sharing or similar agreement (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any
Governmental Authority). No Acquired Company has a contractual or legal
obligation to indemnify any other Person with respect to Taxes. No Acquired
Company has granted any powers of attorney with respect to Taxes that will
remains in force. No closing agreement, private letter ruling, technical
advice memoranda or similar advice or ruling relating to Taxes have been
entered into or issued by any Governmental Authority with respect to or in
respect of any Acquired Company.

 



 

(k) No Acquired Company has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" within the meaning of Code section 355(a)(1)(A).

 



 

(l) No Acquired Company has at any time been a party to any reportable
transaction, as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b).

 



 

Section 3.12. _Employee Benefit Plans_. The following statements are true and
correct:

 



 

(a) **_Schedule 3.12_** sets forth, to the Knowledge of Sellers, all Benefit
Plans to which any Acquired Company contributes or is obligated to contribute,
or under which any Acquired Company has or may have any Liability for premiums
or benefits, or which benefits any employee or former employee of any of the
Acquired Companies or the beneficiaries of any such employee or former
employee (each, a " _Company Plan_ ").

 



 

(b) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company has provided to Purchaser,
to the Knowledge of Sellers, true, complete and correct copies of the
following, if applicable: (i) the plan document together with all amendments;
(ii) any trust agreements, custodial agreements, insurance policies,
administration agreements, and investment management or investment advisory
agreements; (iii) any summary plan descriptions, employee handbooks or similar
employee communications; (iv) in the case of any plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") and any related
correspondence; (v) the most recently filed Form 5500, with schedules
attached; and (vi) any notices, letters or other correspondence from the IRS
or the Department of Labor relating to the Company Plan.

 



 

(c) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination with respect to such qualified
status

 



      
 

 



 

from the IRS. Nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Plan or the exempt
status of any related trust. Each Company Plan, including, without limitation,
any associated trust or fund, has been administered in accordance with its
terms and with applicable law, and nothing has occurred with respect to any
Company Plan that has subjected or could subject any Acquired Company to a
penalty under ERISA or to any excise tax under the Code.

 



 

(d) Except as specified on **_Schedule 3.12_** , all required contributions to
and premium payments on account of each Company Plan have been made timely.

 



 

(e) No Company Plan provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any
participant, beneficiary or former employee after such participants or former
employees termination of employment with the Company, except for employee-
paid coverage as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code or ERISA or
similar state law. To the Knowledge of Sellers, No Company Plan provides
health benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance Contract.

 



 

(f) Each Company Plan has been established, administered and operated in
material compliance with its terms and applicable law, including ERISA and the
Code.

 



 

(g) Neither the Acquired Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever sponsored,
contributed to, been obligated to contribute to, or has had any Liability
(whether contingent or otherwise) under (i) a Benefit Plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, (ii) a
"multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) a "multiple employer plan" as defined in Section
413(c) of the Code or Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or (iv) a multiple
employer welfare arrangement as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA. For this
purpose, "ERISA Affiliate" means any Person that for purposes of Title I and
Title IV of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code would be deemed at any relevant
time to be a single employer with the Company under Section 414(b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA.

 



 

(h) Except as specified on **_Schedule 3.12_** , there are no Proceedings
pending with respect to or under any Company Plan other than routine claims
for plan benefits, and there are no disputes or Proceedings pending or
threatened with respect to any such plans and no such Proceeding appears
reasonably likely to arise.

 



 

(i) Except as specified on **_Schedule 3.12_** , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether alone or combined with any other event, will: (i)
result in any funding requirement or payment obligation by any Acquired
Company or Purchaser to any current or former director, officer, employee or
independent contractor of any Acquired Company, or (ii) increase, vest or
accelerate the payment of, any benefits otherwise payable under any Company
Plan.

 



       
 

 



 

(j) Each Company Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated and administered in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code. There is no Contract or Benefit Plan
to which any Acquired Company is a party by which it is bound to compensate,
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for taxes imposed
pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(k) No provision of any Company Plan would result in any limitation on the
ability of any Acquired Company or Purchaser to terminate the Company Plan.

benefits attributable to each such individual (and any such unpaid commitments
are fully reflected in the Financial Statements) as of (A) the Balance Sheet
Date and (B) the date hereof.

 



 

(b) No Acquired Company is bound by or subject to (and none of its assets or
properties is bound by or subject to) any arrangement with any labor union. No
employee of any Acquired Company is represented by any labor union or other
employee representative body and no employee is covered by any collective
bargaining agreement. There is not currently, nor has there been at any time
during the past three (3) years, any threat of, any strike, slowdown, work

dispute affecting any Acquired Company.

 



 

(c) Each Acquired Company is, and has been during the prior three (3) years,

Reform and Control Act of 1986 and maintains a current Form I-9, as required
by such Act, in the personnel file of each employee. Except as set forth on
**_Schedule 3.13_** , there are no Proceedings against any Acquired Company
pending, or to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened to be brought or filed, by
or with any Governmental Authority by any current or former employee or
independent contractor, current or former applicant of any Acquired Company,
including, without limitation, any claim relating to wages and hours,
classification of employees and independent contractors, unfair labor
practices, employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation, equal pay or
any other employment related matter arising under applicable Legal
Requirements. During the ninety (90) day period prior to the date hereof, the
Company has not taken any action that would constitute a "Mass Layoff" or
"Plant Closing" within the meaning of WARN or

 



      
 

 



 

would otherwise trigger notice requirements or Liability under any state,
local or foreign plant closing notice Legal Requirements.

and (ii) zoning laws and other land use restrictions that do not impair the
present use of the subject property by the Acquired Companies (collectively, "

union or other financial institution in which any Acquired Company has any
account, certificate of deposit or other investment or safe deposit box, the
style and number of each such account or safe deposit box and the names of all
Persons authorized to draw thereon or have access thereto, and (b) the name of
each Person holding a general or special power of attorney from the Acquired
Company and a summary of the terms thereof.

 



 

Section 3.25. _Indebtedness; Guarantees_. The Acquired Companies do not have
any material Indebtedness other than as set forth on **_Schedule 3.25_**. For
each item of Indebtedness, **_Schedule 3.25_** sets forth the debtor, the
Contracts governing all Indebtedness, the principal amount of the Indebtedness
as the date of this Agreement, the creditor, the maturity date and the
collateral, if any, securing the Indebtedness (and all Contracts governing all
related Encumbrances). Except as set forth on **_Schedule 3.25_** , no
Acquired Company has any material

 



      
 

 



 

Liability in respect of a guarantee of any Indebtedness or other Liability of
any other Person (other than another Acquired Company).

 



 

Section 3.26. _Subsidiaries and Predecessors_. **_Schedule 3.26_** sets forth:

list of all names of all entities from which Sellers previously acquired

of all names under which each Acquired Company does business. Except as set
forth on **_Schedule 3.26_** , no Acquired Company owns any interest in any
other entity.

 



 

Section 3.27. _Financial Statements_. Complete and correct copies of the
following financial statements (collectively with the Update Financials
delivered pursuant to _Section 6.10_, the " _Financial Statements_ ") are
attached as **_Schedule 3.27_** :

 



 

(a) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the related unaudited consolidated
statement of income, cash flow and stockholders equity of the Acquired
Companies for the one-year periods ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

 



 

The Financial Statements have been prepared from the books and records of the
Acquired Companies in conformity with GAAP. The Financial Statements present
fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Acquired
Companies and changes in financial position to the respective years covered
thereby as of the dates of such statements and for the periods covered
thereby. The books of account of the Acquired Companies have been kept
accurately in all material respects in the Ordinary Course of Business, the
transactions entered therein represent bona fide transactions, and the
revenues, expenses, assets and Liabilities of the Acquired Companies have been
properly recorded therein in all material respects. None of the Acquired
Companies, or their respective officers and independent auditors, have
identified or been made aware of any fraud or other misrepresentation or
complaint, claim or allegation relating thereto, whether written or oral,
regarding the Financial Statements. The Acquired Companies maintain systems of
internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances that:
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in all
material respects and to maintain accountability for items; (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (iv) recorded accountability for items is compared with
actual levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences. As used herein, the " _Balance Sheet Date_ " means
December 31, 2016.

 



 

Section 3.28. _WIP Schedule_. Attached as **_Schedule 3.28_** is a true and
accurate schedule of work in progress for all Contracts for the sale of goods
or services (the " _WIP Schedule_ ") showing: (a) the price of each Contract,
(b) the status and estimated value of all work completed through December 31,
2016 (the " _WIP Date_ "), (c) the amount of revenue billed and received as of
the WIP Date, (d) the retainage withheld from the work billed and the
estimated amount of retainage for unbilled completed work, (e) the expected
total cost to complete each Contract as of the WIP Date, and (f) the value of
the remaining work. The WIP Schedule fairly represents the total estimated
Contract costs and values (taking into account man-hours required, project
duration, cost of labor and materials, including any escalation thereof,
subcontractor costs, and

 



      
 

 



 

other elements of Contract costs), and, except as set forth on **_Schedule
3.28_** , there is no dispute over amounts billed thereunder or of any
intention to hold back amounts in excess of contractually permitted
retainages.

 



 

Section 3.29. _Customers and Suppliers_. **_Schedule 3.29_** sets forth a
complete and accurate list of: (a) the Acquired Companies ten (10) largest
customers (measured by aggregate billings) during the current fiscal year,
indicating the existing Contracts with each such customer by product or
service provided, and (b) the Acquired Companies ten (10) largest suppliers
of materials, products, or services (measured by the aggregate amount
purchased by the Acquired Companies) during the current fiscal year,
indicating the Contracts for continued supply from each such supplier. The
Acquired Companies relationships with the customers and the suppliers
required to be listed on **_Schedule 3.29_** are, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
good commercial working relationships and none of such customers or suppliers
has canceled, terminated or otherwise materially altered (including any
material reduction in the rate or amount of sales or purchases or material
increase in the prices charged or paid, as the case may be) or notified the
respective Acquired Company of any intention to do any of the foregoing or
otherwise threatened in writing to cancel, terminate, or materially alter
(including any material reduction in the rate or amount of sales or purchases,
as the case may be) its relationship with the respective Acquired Company.

 



 

Section 3.30. _Representations Not Misleading_. Sellers and the Company hereby
represent and warrant that no representation or warranty by Sellers and the
Company in this Agreement, nor any certificate, exhibit or schedule furnished
to Purchaser by Sellers or any Acquired Company under and pursuant to this
Agreement, knowingly contains or will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements contained herein or therein not misleading, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made.

Section 6.3. _Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation_.

 



 

(a) Prohibited Activities. Sellers shall not, for a period of (i) five (5)
years for the Group One Sellers, or (ii) three (3) years for the Group Two
Sellers, following the Closing Date (the " _Noncompete Term_ "), for any

the operations or management of the business, not more than one percent (1%)
of any class of securities of any business whose securities are publicly
traded on a national securities exchange or over-the-counter market.

 



 

(b) _Equitable Relief_. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses
to Purchaser as a result of a breach of the foregoing covenant, and because of
the immediate and irreparable damage that could be caused to Purchaser and its
Affiliates for which they would have no other adequate remedy, Sellers agree
and acknowledge that, in the event of a breach by such Seller of any of the
covenants set forth in this _Section 6.3_, Purchaser may, at its option, in
addition to obtaining any other remedy or relief available to it (including
Damages at law), enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.3_ by injunction
and other equitable relief.

 



 

(c) _Reasonable Restraint_. Sellers agree and acknowledge that the covenants
contained in this _Section 6.3_ impose a reasonable restraint on Sellers in
light of the activities and business of Purchaser and its Affiliates and the
future plans of Purchaser and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that it
is also the intent of the

 



      
 

 



 

Parties that such covenants be reasonably construed and enforced in accordance
with the changing activities, business and locations of Purchaser and its
Affiliates throughout the term of this _Section 6.3_.

 



 

(d) _Severability; Reformation_. The covenants in this _Section 6.3_ are
severable and separate, and the unenforceability of any specific covenant
shall not affect the provisions of any other covenant or any other provision
contained in this Agreement. Moreover, in the event any court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions
set forth are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the Parties that such
restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent which the court deems
reasonable, and the Agreement shall thereby be reformed.

 



 

(e) _Independent Covenant_. Sellers acknowledge that the agreements and
covenants made by Sellers in this _Section 6.3_ are material conditions to
the willingness of Purchaser to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. All of the covenants in this
_Section 6.3_ shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other
provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any Proceeding of any Seller
against Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, whether predicated
on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the
enforcement by Purchaser of such covenants. It is specifically agreed that the
period of five (5) years stated at the beginning of this _Section 6.3_,
during which the agreements and covenants of each Seller made in this _Section
6.3_ shall be effective, shall be computed by excluding from such computation
any time during which such Seller is in violation of any provision of this
_Section 6.3_. The covenants contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall not be
affected by any breach of any other provision hereof by any Party.

 



 

Section 6.4. _Confidential Information_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Sellers agree and acknowledge that Sellers have in the past,
currently have, and in the future may possibly have, access to certain
confidential information of Purchaser and the Acquired Companies, such as
operational policies, pricing and cost policies, and other information, that
are valuable, special and unique assets of Purchaser and/or the Acquired
Companies. Each Seller agrees that no Seller shall disclose such confidential
information to any Person for any purpose or reason whatsoever, except (i) to
authorized Representatives of Purchaser, (ii) after the Closing, such
information may be disclosed by any Seller as is required in the course of
performing such Sellers duties for Purchaser, (iii) to counsel and other
advisers, _provided_ , that such advisers (other than counsel) agree to the
confidentiality provisions of this _Section 6.4_, unless (a) such information
becomes known to the public generally through no fault of any Seller, (b) such
information becomes known to a Seller through disclosure from a third party
that was not legally obligated to keep confidential such information, or (c)
disclosure is required by law or the order of any Governmental Authority under
color of law; _provided_ , that prior to disclosing any information pursuant
to this

 



      
 

 



 

clause (c), the disclosing Seller shall, give prior written notice thereof to
Purchaser and provide Purchaser with the opportunity to contest such
disclosure.

 



 

(b) _Equitable Relief_. Because of the difficulty of measuring economic losses
as a result of the breach of the foregoing covenants in this _Section 6.4_,
and because of the immediate and irreparable damage that would be caused for
which Purchaser would have no other adequate remedy, each Seller agrees that
the foregoing covenants may be enforced against such Seller by injunctions,
restraining orders and other appropriate equitable relief. Nothing herein
shall be construed as prohibiting Purchaser from pursuing any other available
remedy for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of
monetary Damages.

 



 

Section 6.5. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party to
this Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in connection with
the preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein, including all fees and expenses of its

Acquired Companies prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein.

efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to file or cause to be filed
all documents, to give or cause to be given all notices to Governmental
Authorities or other Persons, to obtain or cause to be obtained all

pursuant to the HSR Act that is required to be made by such Party or its
ultimate parent with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
and shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all other
filings, submissions and registrations required to be made by such Party and
its Affiliates under applicable Legal Requirements, in each case, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after, and in no event more than thirty (30)
Business Days following, the date hereof. The Parties shall furnish each other
with all necessary information and cooperate with each other in connection
with the preparation of such filings, submissions and registrations and seek
to secure the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act (and any applicable foreign antitrust or competition Legal
Requirements) and to obtain all such authorizations, consents, waivers,
approvals, permits and orders as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative,
on the other hand, shall provide each other reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any filing, submission, registration or other written
communication to be given to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the efforts taken pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby. If any
Proceeding, whether initiated by a Governmental Authority or a private party,
arising out of or relating to any such filing, submission or registration or
otherwise relating to the transaction contemplated hereby is initiated or
threatened, Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative, on
the other hand, shall keep each other reasonably informed of any material
communications and developments in connection therewith. In addition, to the
extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ and other relevant Persons, give the
other the opportunity to attend and participate in any meetings and
conferences relating to such filings, submissions, registrations and actions.
The Parties shall promptly respond to all inquiries made by the FTC, DOJ and
any other applicable Governmental Authorities in connection with such filings,
submissions or registrations or otherwise in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby, and promptly provide to such Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material requested under applicable
Legal Requirements. If any objections are raised or asserted with respect to
the transaction contemplated hereby under any Legal Requirement or if any
Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ
or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transaction contemplated hereby as being in violation
of any applicable Legal Requirement or which would otherwise prevent, impede
or delay the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby, the Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections
or Proceedings so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, that no Party shall be
required to, and Sellers and the Acquired Companies may not (without the prior
written consent of Purchaser), enter into any agreements or commitments or
take any other actions to resolve any such objections or Proceedings if such
agreement, commitment or other action would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to (i) prevent consummation of any of the
transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) result in any of the transactions
contemplated hereby being rescinded following the Closing, (iii) limit or
otherwise adversely affect the right of Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof)
to own or vote any Stock, control any of the Acquired Companies or operate all
or any portion of the business or (iv) require or compel any Acquired Company,
Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser to dispose of all or any portion of
its properties or assets.

 



 

Section 6.7. _Further Assurances_. Each of the Parties shall use reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to
be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Legal
Requirements, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as
may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

 



 

Section 6.8. _Further Consents_. If the transfer of the Stock to Purchaser at
the Closing without the consent or approval of a third person would constitute
a breach of any Contract or other obligation to which the Acquired Companies
is a party or by which the Acquired Companies or any of their properties are
bound or create in any other Person the right to declare a default in respect
of, or to cancel or terminate, any such Contract or other obligation or any
Governmental Authorization, license, permit, franchise, or other right of the
Acquired Companies, and if such consent or approval (or an effective waiver
thereof) is not obtained prior to the Closing, then Purchaser shall have the
right by an instrument executed in writing and delivered to the Sellers
Representative at the Closing to cause the transfer of the Stock not to carry
with it an assignment of the item or items that necessitate such consent or
approval until

 



      
 

 



 

such consent or approval (or an effective waiver thereof) shall have been
obtained. In such an event, Sellers will continue after the Closing to use
their best efforts promptly to obtain such consents and approvals, or
effective waivers thereof, and will cooperate with Purchaser in any reasonable
arrangement designed to provide Purchaser with the benefit of the Acquired
Companies rights thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.9. _Cooperation, Access to Records_. From the date hereof until the
Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement, the Acquired
Companies shall provide Purchaser and its Representatives with access at all
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice to the offices, properties, books,
records (including tax records), Contracts, financial and operating data and
other information and documents of the Acquired Companies (and to make copies
of such information as Purchaser may reasonably request) in order for
Purchaser to have the opportunity to make such investigation as it shall
reasonably desire to make of the affairs of the Acquired Companies; _provided_
, that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations
of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

Section 6.10. _Update Financials_. Sellers shall cause to be prepared and
furnished to Purchaser (i) promptly after becoming available and in any event
within twenty (20) days of the end of each calendar month, the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies, and the related
unaudited consolidated statement of income, cash flow and changes in
stockholders equity of the Acquired Companies (the " _Update Financials_ ")
for each month following the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing Date, and
(ii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of
December 31, 2015 and 2016 and the audited statements of operations,
stockholders equity, income and cash flows for the year ended December 31,
2015 and 2016.

 



 

Section 6.11. _Indemnified Receivables Title Transfer_. If Sellers indemnify
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(vi)_ for Indemnified Receivables, then
Purchaser shall promptly transfer to Sellers title to such Indemnified
Receivables and Sellers may seek to collect such Indemnified Receivables;
_provided, however_ , that Sellers are obligated to exercise reasonable care
with regard to the overall continuing business interests of the Company and
Purchaser in attempting to collect such Indemnified Receivables. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Purchaser offsets any Indemnified Receivables through
the Note as set forth in _Section 7.5_ and Purchaser later collects any such
amounts, then Purchaser shall promptly pay Seller the value of any such
amounts actually collected.

 



 

Section 6.12. _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing, each of
the Parties shall disclose to the other Party in writing any material breaches
of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in _ARTICLE
III_ or _ARTICLE IV_, as applicable, and any other matters that would
reasonably be likely to result in any of the conditions to Closing set forth
in this Agreement not to be satisfied, promptly upon discovery thereof.

 



 

Section 6.13. _Closing_. From the date hereof until the Closing, each of the
Parties shall use reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to
expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in _ARTICLE II_
hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.14. _No Alternative Transactions_. Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with its terms, neither Sellers nor any Acquired
Company shall, directly or indirectly, through any current or former
shareholder, member, officer, director, manager, agent, Affiliate or
otherwise, solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any proposal or
offer from any Person relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any
material portion of the assets of, or any equity or other interest in, any of
the Acquired Companies or any business combination with any of the Acquired
Companies, or directly or indirectly participate in, or cause, permit or
encourage their respective Representatives to participate in, any discussions
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate or negotiate in any way with, or assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. The Sellers Representative shall
notify Purchaser in writing immediately (in any event within one Business Day)
of any such proposal or offer, and of each inquiry or contact with any Person
with respect thereto, made and shall, in any such notice to Purchaser,
indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact.

 



 

Section 6.15. _Publicity_. No public announcement or disclosure (including any
general announcement to employees, customers or suppliers) will be made by any
Party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Purchaser and the
Sellers Representative; _provided_ , that the provisions of this _Section
6.15_ shall not prohibit (a) any disclosure required by any applicable Legal
Requirements (in which case the disclosing Party will provide the other
Parties with the opportunity to review and comment in advance of such
disclosure) or (b) any disclosure made in connection with the enforcement of
any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or any ancillary agreement
hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII _ 
INDEMNIFICATION_**

 



 

Section 7.1. _Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge_. The right
to indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this _ARTICLE VII_
will not be affected by any investigation conducted by Purchaser or its
Representatives with respect to, or any Knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) by Purchaser or its Representatives at any time, whether
before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty (as may be modified by
any Disclosure Schedule), or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification in
accordance with the provisions of this _ARTICLE VII_, unless such waiver
shall expressly state that it includes a waiver of rights to indemnification
under this _ARTICLE VII_. No Party shall be required to demonstrate the
actual or constructive Knowledge of any other Party as a condition of
indemnification for any claim.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.2. _Indemnification and Payment of Damages by Sellers_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Sellers will, jointly and severally,

warranty would read if all qualifications as to Knowledge or materiality were
deleted therefrom) and any misrepresentation in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the provisions of Section
7.2(b);

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment by any Seller, the Sellers Representative
or the Acquired Companies of, or any noncompliance by any Seller, the Sellers

(iii) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finders fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have
been made by any such Person with any Seller or any Acquired Company (or any
of their respective Representatives) in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement;

 



 

(iv) any Proceedings resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or caused by
the business, ownership, and operation of the Acquired Companies or any
Business Facility on or prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(v) any Proceedings resulting from, arising out of, relating to, or caused by
any Liability of an Acquired Company for (i) any and all Taxes (and losses
attributable to such Taxes or the nonpayment thereof) of an Acquired Company
(or any predecessor thereof) for any Tax period on or prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) any and all Taxes of any Person other than an Acquired Company for
which an Acquired Company is liable by reason of either an Acquired Company
(or any predecessor thereof) having been a member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group on or prior to the Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or
similar state, local or non-U.S. law, regulation or authority, (iii) any and
all Taxes of any Person other than the Acquired Company imposed on any

(iv) any Taxes imposed on an Acquired Company attributable to the making of an
election under Code section 338(h)(10);

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) any failure of the Acquired Companies to collect the full amount of the
Indemnified Receivables outstanding as of the Closing Date within the first
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (or in the case of retainage,
within nine (9) months after completion of the underlying project, but in any
event no later than thirty (30) months after the Closing Date);

 



 

(vii) without limiting the foregoing provisions, any violation by any Seller
or any Acquired Company (or their respective predecessors) of any
Environmental Law and the presence, emanation, migration, disposal, release or
threatened release of any Materials of Environmental Concern on, within, or to
or from, any property presently or previously owned or leased by any Seller or
any Acquired Company (or their respective predecessors) as a result of (a) the
presence of and closure or removal of any underground storage tank on such
property which results in an Environmental Claim regarding Materials of
Environmental Concern, (b) the operations of any Acquired Company (or their
respective predecessors), (c) the condition of such property prior to being

activities of any third party not affiliated with Purchaser and not invited on
such property by Purchaser, which activities occurred on or prior to the
Closing Date;

 



 

(viii) net of reserves existing in the Financial Statements, the pending or
settled litigation claims more fully described on **_Schedule 3.10_** ; or

 



 

(ix) fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

 



 

In the event that any Purchaser Indemnified Person wishes to make a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 7.2_, the Indemnified Person shall give
written notice of such claim to the Sellers Representative within the
applicable time limitations contained herein. Any such notice shall describe
the breach or inaccuracy and other material facts and circumstances upon which
such claim is based and the estimated amount of Damages involved, in each
case, in reasonable detail in light of the facts then known to Purchaser
Indemnified Person; _provided_ , that no defect in the information contained
in such notice from Purchaser Indemnified Person to the Sellers
Representative will relieve Sellers from any obligation under this _Section
7.2_, except to the extent such failure to include information actually and
materially prejudices Sellers. Within ten (10) days after receipt of written
notification from Purchaser Indemnified Persons, Sellers shall diligently
commence resolution of such matters in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser Indemnified Persons and shall diligently and timely prosecute such
resolution to completion. If Sellers, within ten (10) days after their receipt
of such notice (or such shorter time as may be necessary under the
circumstances), fail to diligently commence resolution of such matters in a
manner reasonably acceptable to Purchaser Indemnified Persons, Purchaser
Indemnified Persons shall have the right to undertake all appropriate and
reasonable actions to resolve or otherwise address such matters at the sole
expense of Sellers. With respect to those claims that Sellers are not
disputing in good faith and that may be satisfied by payment of a liquidated
sum of money, including, without limitation, claims for reimbursement of
expenses

 



       
 

 



 

incurred in connection with any circumstances entitling Purchaser Indemnified
Persons to indemnity hereunder, Sellers shall pay, each according to its Pro
Rata Percentage, the full amount so claimed to the extent supported by
reasonable documentation within fifteen (15) days of such resolution, subject
to _Section 7.5_. If Sellers disputes Liability in connection with such
claim, Sellers shall pay any undisputed part of such Liability (subject to
_Section 7.5_) and Purchaser and Sellers shall resolve any remaining dispute
as soon as practicable but in any event within a reasonable time thereafter.
If any Proceeding is commenced or threatened by any third party for which
Purchaser Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 7.2_, the provisions of _Section 7.4_ shall control.

 



 

(b) _Monetary Limitations_. Sellers will have no obligation to indemnify
Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Sections 7.2_ or _7.4_ in respect
of Damages arising from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation,
warranty or statement described therein unless and until the aggregate amount
of all such Damages incurred or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars and no cents ($250,000.00) (at
which point Sellers will indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Persons for all such
Damages in excess of such amount), and Sellers aggregate liability in respect
of claims for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 7.2_ or _7.4_ and will not
exceed the aggregate outstanding amount payable on the Notes together with any
earn-out amounts earned but not yet payable pursuant to the Earn-Out
Agreement, _provided_ , that the foregoing limitations will not apply to
claims for indemnification pursuant to _Sections 7.2(a)(v)_ , _7.2(a)(vii)_
and _7.2(a)(ix) _or _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ in respect of breaches of, or
inaccuracies in, the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
3.1_ (Organization), _3.3_ (Power and Authority), _3.11_ (Tax Matters), or,
with respect to claims related to real property owned by any Seller and
occupied by the Acquired Companies prior to Closing, _3.19_ (Environmental
Matters).

 



 

Section 7.3. _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser will indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless each Seller and his Representatives and Affiliates (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from, against and in respect of any and all
Damages sustained or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Person to the extent
relating to, resulting from or arising out of, or any allegation by any third
party of:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser set forth herein
or in any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith (as
each such representation or warranty would read if all qualifications as to
Knowledge or materiality were deleted therefrom) and any misrepresentation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment by Purchaser of, or noncompliance by
Purchaser with, any covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein or in
any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finders fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding alleged to have
been made by such Person with Purchaser (or any of its Representatives) in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated herein;

 



 

(iv) any claims related to the business, ownership, and operations of the
Acquired Companies or any Business Facility that accrue after the Closing
Date; or

 



 

(v) fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

 



 

Except in cases of Proceedings arising from, fraud or willful or criminal
misconduct, and except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Sellers
acknowledge that their sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with
respect to any and all claims and Damages relating to this Agreement and any
transactions contemplated herein shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE VII_.

 



 

In the event that any Seller Indemnified Person wishes to make a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 7.3_, Seller Indemnified Person shall
give written notice of such claim to Purchaser within the applicable time
limitations contained in _Section 7.7_. Any such notice shall describe the
breach or inaccuracy and other material facts and circumstances upon which
such claim is based and the estimated amount of Damages involved, in each
case, in reasonable detail in light of the facts then known to Seller
Indemnified Person; _provided_ , that no defect in the information contained
in such notice from Seller Indemnified Person to Purchaser will relieve
Purchaser from any obligation under this _Section 7.3_, except to the extent
such failure to include information actually and materially prejudices
Purchaser. With respect to matters not involving Proceedings brought or
asserted by third parties, within ten (10) days after receipt of written
notification from Seller Indemnified Persons, Purchaser shall diligently
commence resolution of such matters in a manner reasonably acceptable to
Seller Indemnified Persons and shall diligently and timely prosecute such
resolution to completion. If Purchaser, within ten (10) days after its receipt
of such notice (or such shorter time as may be necessary under the
circumstances), fails to diligently commence resolution of such matters in a
manner reasonably acceptable to Seller Indemnified Persons, Seller Indemnified
Persons shall have the right to undertake all appropriate and reasonable
actions to resolve or otherwise address such matters at the sole expense of
Purchaser to the extent such matters are subject to indemnification under this
_Section 7.3_. With respect to those claims that Purchaser is not disputing
in good faith and that may be satisfied by payment of a liquidated sum of
money, including, without limitation, claims for reimbursement of expenses
incurred in connection with any circumstances entitling Seller Indemnified
Persons to indemnity hereunder, Purchaser shall pay the full amount so claimed
to the extent supported by reasonable documentation within fifteen (15) days
of such resolution. If Purchaser disputes its Liability in connection with
such claim, it shall, subject to _Section 7.5_ hereof, pay any undisputed
part of such Liability and Sellers and Purchaser shall resolve any remaining
dispute as soon as practicable but in any event within a reasonable time
thereafter. If any Proceeding is commenced or threatened by any third party
for which Seller Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification under
this _Section 7.3_, the provisions of _Section 7.4_ shall control.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Monetary Limitations_. Purchasers will have no obligation to indemnify
Seller Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Sections 7.3_ or _7.4_ in respect of
Damages arising from the breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation,
warranty or statement described therein unless and until the aggregate amount
of all such Damages incurred or suffered by Seller Indemnified Persons exceeds
one hundred fifty thousand dollars and no cents ($150,000.00) (at which point
Purchaser will indemnify Seller Indemnified Persons for all such Damages in
excess of such amount).

 



 

Section 7.4. _Notice and Defense of Third Party Claims_. If any Proceeding
(other than any Proceeding relating to Taxes) shall be brought or asserted
under this Article against an indemnified Party or any successor thereto (the
" _Indemnified Person_ ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
this Article from an indemnifying Person or any successor thereto (the "
_Indemnifying Person_ "), the Indemnified Person shall give prompt written
notice of such Proceeding to the Indemnifying Person who shall assume the
defense and reasonable control thereof, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and the payment of all
expenses so long as the Indemnifying Person gives written notice to the
Indemnified Person within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Person has
given the Indemnifying Person notice of the Proceeding that the Indemnifying
Person will indemnify the Indemnified Person from and against the entirety of
any and all Damages that the Indemnified Person may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Proceeding. In
no event shall any Indemnified Person be required to make any expenditure or
bring any Proceeding to enforce the Indemnifying Persons obligations and
Liability under and pursuant to the indemnifications set forth in this
Article. The Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any of the foregoing Proceedings and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Person unless the Indemnified Person shall in good faith
determine that there exist actual or potential conflicts of interest that make
representation by the same counsel inappropriate. The Indemnified Persons
right to participate in the defense or response to any Proceeding should not
be deemed to limit or otherwise modify its obligations under this Article. In
the event that the Indemnifying Person, within five (5) days after notice of
any such Proceeding, fails to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of such Proceeding for the account and at the expense of the Indemnifying
Person, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to assume the defense
and reasonable control of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Person at any time prior to the settlement, compromise or
final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of
a Proceeding, the Indemnifying Person shall not, without the Indemnified
Persons prior written consent, settle or compromise any Proceeding or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to any Proceeding unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment: (i) requires solely the payment of money
Damages by the Indemnifying Person and such Damages are paid by the
Indemnifying Person, (ii) includes as an unconditional term thereof the
release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the Indemnified Person from all
Liability in respect of such Proceeding, and (iii) involves no finding or
admission of any Liability of the Indemnified Person or violation of any Legal
Requirement or the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that
may be made against the Indemnifying Person. If the Indemnifying Person
assumes defense of a Proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall not be entitled
to recovery from the Indemnifying Person with respect to any compromise or
settlement

 



      
 

 



 

thereof effected by the Indemnified Person without the consent of the
Indemnifying Person unless the Indemnified Person has retained or reassumed
the defense of such Proceeding pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
7.4_.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Payment; Interest_. To the extent that Sellers become obligated
to make any monetary payment to Purchaser, including any obligations with
respect to the first One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) of Indemnified
Receivables, and subject to the provisions of section 7.2(b), above Purchaser
after entering into a mutually agreed letter agreement or similar written
instrument setting forth the amounts payable from Sellers to Purchaser as
payable to Purchaser by Sellers and signed by Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Sellers, may, in its sole discretion, elect to
offset such monetary payment against (i) any remaining obligations owed to
Sellers under the Notes on a dollar for dollar basis by applying each Sellers
Pro Rata Percentage to the amount being set off by Purchaser and deducting
such amount from the applicable Sellers Note, or (ii) any earn-out amounts
that have been earned but are not yet payable pursuant to the Earn-Out
Agreement on a dollar for dollar basis by applying each Sellers Pro Rata
Percentage to the amount of being set off by Purchaser and deducting such
amount from the amount of the Earn-Out that is or may become payable to the
applicable Seller. Except as specifically set forth herein, the Indemnifying
Person shall make any payment required to be made under this Article in cash
and on demand. Any Damages or other payments required to be paid by an
Indemnifying Person under this _ARTICLE VII_ that are not paid within thirty
(30) Business Days of receipt by the Indemnifying Person of the Indemnified
Persons demand therefore shall thereafter be deemed delinquent, and the
Indemnifying Person shall pay to the Indemnified Person immediately upon
demand, interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum, not to exceed the
maximum non-usurious rate allowed by applicable law, from the date such
payment becomes delinquent to the date of payment of such delinquent sums
_provided_ , that payments under the Notes or the Earn-Out Agreement offset by
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ shall only accrue interest pursuant
to the foregoing clause to the extent that they are delinquent following the
date for payment in the Note or Earn-Out Agreement, as applicable.

 



 

Section 7.6. _Inconsistent Provisions_. Other than with respect to any
Proceedings relating to Taxes, the provisions of this Article shall govern and
control over any inconsistent provisions of this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt any inconsistent provisions of this Agreement relating to Proceedings
relating to Taxes shall be governed first by _ARTICLE VIII_.

 



 

Section 7.7. _Time for Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, schedule, statement,
document or instrument furnished hereunder, Sellers and Purchasers
obligations of indemnification are limited as set forth in this _Section
7.7_. No claim may be made or suit initiated seeking indemnification pursuant
to _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ for any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty or statement unless a written notice is provided to
the Indemnifying Person:

 



 

(a) at any time, with respect to the representations and warranties contained
in _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3_, _Section 3.4_, _Section
4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3_ and _Section 4.4_ and each of the
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and the corresponding
indemnification obligations thereto, which representations, warranties and
obligations shall continue without termination;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) at any time prior to the thirtieth day following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, with respect to the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 3.11_, _Section 3.12_, _Section 3.16_, and
_Section 3.19_ and the corresponding indemnification obligations thereto,
which representations, warranties and obligations shall terminate upon the
expiration of the statute of limitations (as at any time extended) applicable
to the claim related thereto;

 



 

(c) at any time, in the case of any claim or suit based upon, intentional
misrepresentation, or gross negligence, (i) any willful, fraudulent, or
grossly negligent actions or representations of Sellers and the corresponding
indemnification obligations thereto, which representations, warranties, and
obligations shall continue without termination, and (ii) any claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.4_ (in each case as such
indemnification obligations would read if all qualifications as to survival
were deleted therefrom), which obligations shall continue without termination;
and

 



 

(d) at any time prior the third anniversary of this agreement, with respect to
any breach of or inaccuracy in, any other representation, warranty or
statement in this Agreement or any Schedule, Exhibit, statement or certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 7.8. _Express Negligence_. THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN THIS
_ARTICLE VII_ ARE INTENDED TO BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE THEREOF, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY
PARTY (INCLUDING THE PARTY FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR
PROVES THE CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PARTY
SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION OR THE CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE
PARTY SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT BY SUCH PARTY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO PARTY
SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FOR THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO
SUCH OTHER PARTYS CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT THAT SUCH OTHER PARTYS CONCURRENT, CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE HAS BEEN FINALLY DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DISPUTE
RESOLUTION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII _ 
TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

Section 8.1. _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. The Sellers Representative shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Acquired Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date that are filed after the Closing Date, including but not limited to, any
short-period return resulting from the transactions contemplated herein. Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the prior practice
of the Acquired Companies unless otherwise required by applicable law. The
Sellers Representative shall provide copies of such Tax Returns to Purchaser
and its authorized Representatives for

 



      
 

 



 

review at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing thereof, and shall make
such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Purchaser.
The Acquired Companies shall file such Tax Returns as finally prepared
hereunder. Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect to
such periods and such Tax Returns (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Tax imposed on an Acquired Company attributable to making a Section 338(h)(10)
Election as defined below).

 



 

Section 8.2. _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for Tax periods that begin on or
before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_
"). Any Tax Return for any Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner and
utilizing judgments consistent with the Acquired Companies prior practice,
unless such practices, manner or judgments are unreasonable or improper.
Purchaser shall provide the Sellers Representative with copies of such Tax
Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing thereof, and shall make
such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Sellers
Representative. Sellers shall pay to Purchaser within ten (10) days prior to
the filing of a Straddle Period Tax Return, an amount equal to the portion of
such Taxes that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the
Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section 8.2_, in the case of any Taxes
that are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that relates
to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be (i)
in the case of any Taxes (including real property Taxes and other property
Taxes) other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts (or
imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property or any other specifically identifiable transaction or event), be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income or receipts (including franchise Taxes) or imposed
in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property or any
other specifically identifiable transaction or event, the Tax payable by
Sellers shall be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the
relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date based on an interim closing
of the books as of the end of the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the
taxable period of any partnership or pass-through entity will be deemed
terminated at such time); provided however that any item determined on an
annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation or real estate
Taxes) shall be apportioned on a daily basis.

 



 

Section 8.3. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser, each Acquired Company, the Sellers Representative and Sellers
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _ARTICLE
VIII_ and any litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such litigation or other Proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Each Acquired Company and Sellers shall (i)
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Acquired Companies relating

 



      
 

 



 

to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or the Sellers
Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (ii) give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other Party so requests, the Acquired Companies or the Sellers
Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take
possession of such books and records.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon prior written request, to use
their reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(c) Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon request, to provide the other
Party with all information that either Party may be required to report
pursuant to Sections 6043 or 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



 

Section 8.4. _Transfer Taxes_. Sellers shall bear one hundred percent (100%)
of all sales, transfer, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar
Taxes, levies, fees, and charges, if any (including all real estate transfer
Taxes and conveyance and recording fees, if any), that may be imposed upon, or
payable or collectible or incurred in connection with, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers as to
the filing of any necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such
Taxes.

 



 

Section 8.5. _Tax Proceeding_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser and each Acquired Company, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative on behalf of the Sellers, on the other hand, shall promptly
notify each other in writing upon receipt by such Party of written notice of
any Proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding_ ").

 



 

(b) With respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding that relates solely to a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which Sellers have
an indemnity obligation under this Agreement, Sellers shall have fifteen (15)
days after receipt of written notice of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding
(either from Purchaser or directly from the relevant Governmental Authority)
to elect (by written notice to Purchaser) to have responsibility for directing
the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding. If a Seller exercises its
option to direct the defense of any such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding, then
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies will reasonably cooperate therewith
(which cooperation shall include providing any necessary powers of attorney);
_provided_ , _however_ , if any Seller chooses to exercise such option then
with respect to such claim: (i) Sellers will pay any amount that is required
by any Governmental Authority to be surrendered, deposited, posted as
collateral, or otherwise paid in order to pursue the defense of

 



      
 

 



 

such claim; (ii) Sellers will pay all of their own fees, costs and other
expenses incurred in conducting such defense of such claim; (iii) the Sellers
Representative and Purchaser and each of its Representatives will cooperate in
good faith in resolving such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding; (iv) Purchaser may
participate in the conduct of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding at its own
expense, and the Sellers Representative shall keep Purchaser reasonably
informed regarding the progress of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding; and (v) no
Seller will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise
or settlement of such claim underlying the Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding without
the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld). If Sellers do not exercise
their option within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice of any
Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding for which it was entitled to exercise its option,
Purchaser will be entitled to direct the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax
Proceeding; provided, however, (i) Purchaser will cooperate with the Sellers
Representative on behalf of Sellers in good faith in resolving such Pre-
Closing Tax Proceeding; (ii) the Sellers Representative may participate in
the conduct of the Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding at its own expense; and (iii)
Purchaser shall keep the Sellers Representative reasonably informed regarding
the progress of such Pre-Closing Tax Proceeding.

 



 

Section 8.6. _Section 338 Election_.

 



 

(a) Sellers will join with Purchaser in making an election under Code section
338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the purchase and sale of the Stock
hereunder (and any similar elections that are available under state Tax Laws
in states where an Acquired Company files income or franchise Tax Returns)
(each a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"). Purchaser shall deliver to the
Sellers Representative a completed Form 8023 (and a duly executed similar
form for each state in which a separate Section 338(h)(10) Election will be
made) following Closing. Each Seller shall provide Purchaser with the duly
signed IRS Form 8023 (and similar state forms) within thirty (30) days of
their receipt of such forms from Purchaser. If, after the Closing Date,
Purchaser identifies any additional Section 338(h)(10) Elections, Sellers
shall cooperate with Purchaser in making any such Section 338(h)(10) Elections
and complete any required forms provided by Purchaser. Purchaser shall effect
the timely filing of a completed Form 8023 and shall take such other steps,
including those required by IRS Form 8023 and Treasury Regulation section
1.338(h)(10)-1 (and corresponding state Legal Requirements), as Purchaser may
determine to be necessary to make an effective Section 338(h)(10) Election.
Purchaser, Sellers and each Acquired Company shall report the purchase by
Purchaser of Stock in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections and shall take no position inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return
or otherwise.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, IRS
Form 8883 (and any applicable corresponding state Tax forms) (such forms, the
" _Allocation Forms_ "), and shall take such other action required pursuant to
the Treasury Regulations under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
applicable

 



      
 

 



 

corresponding state Tax Laws) to report the allocation of the aggregate
Purchase Price, including assumed Liabilities of the Acquired Companies, among
the assets of the Acquired Companies in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements. Purchaser shall provide a draft of such Allocation Forms to the
Sellers Representative within one hundred twenty (120) days of Closing, and
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to agree on a final allocation of the Purchase Price. To the extent
any adjustments are made to the aggregate Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
1.3_ or _Section 1.4_ of this Agreement, Purchaser shall revise such
Allocation Forms in a manner consistent with final allocation agreed to
between Purchaser and the Sellers Representative to reflect any such
adjustments. If the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative are unable to
agree, the matter shall be resolved consistent with the Resolving Accountant
process set forth in _Section 1.3(a)_. Each Acquired Company shall provide
copies of the Allocation Forms to the Sellers Representative at least ten
(10) days before filing the Allocation Forms with the IRS. The Parties shall
agree that the aggregate Purchase Price and the Liabilities of the Company
will be allocated to the assets of the Company in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Forms for Tax purposes. No Acquired Company, Seller or Purchaser
shall file any Tax Return, or take any position with a taxing authority, that
is inconsistent with such Allocation Forms; _provided_ , that this shall not
prevent a Party from settling a Proceeding with a Governmental Authority. In
the event the Purchase Price, for Tax purposes, is adjusted pursuant to this
Agreement after the Allocation Forms are filed, the Allocation Forms will be
amended to provide that such adjustments shall be allocated among the assets
of the Company in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6.

Company include the predecessor thereof.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX _ 
MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

Section 9.1. Sellers Representative.

 



 

(a) Appointment. The Sellers Representative shall have full power and
authority on behalf of the Sellers to take all actions under this Agreement
and any other agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are to be taken by the
Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative shall take any and all
actions which it believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement,
including giving and receiving any notice or instruction permitted or required
under this Agreement by the Sellers Representative, interpreting all of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, authorizing payments to be made with
respect hereto or thereto, conducting negotiations with Purchaser and its
agents regarding such claims, dealing with Purchaser under this Agreement,
taking any other actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement, and
engaging counsel, accountants or other representatives in connection with the
foregoing matters.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Authorization. Prior to the Closing, the Company, and after the Closing,
the Sellers, hereby authorize the Sellers Representative to:

 



 

(i) receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the Sellers
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith or therewith and to receive and
accept services of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding
arising under this Agreement;

 



 

(ii) engage counsel, accountants and other advisors, and incur other expenses
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, as the Sellers Representative may in his sole discretion deem
necessary or appropriate; and

 



 

(iii) take such action as the Sellers Representative may, in his sole
discretion, deem necessary or appropriate in respect of: (A) waiving any
inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered by Purchaser pursuant hereto; (B)
taking such other action as the Sellers Representative is authorized to take
under this Agreement; (C) receiving all documents or certificates and making
all determinations, in its capacity as Sellers Representative, required under
this Agreement; and (D) all such actions as may be necessary to carry out the
responsibilities of the Sellers Representative contemplated by this Agreement
or document or agreement contemplated hereby, including any waiver of any
obligation of Purchaser.

 



 

(c) Agency. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Sellers
Representative is not an agent of the Sellers, and shall have no duties to the
Sellers or liability to the Sellers with respect to any action taken, decision
made or instruction given by the Sellers Representative in connection with
this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing exculpation of the
Sellers Representative shall not apply to the extent that such actions,
decisions or instructions have been finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to result from the Sellers Representatives fraud or willful
misconduct.

 



 

(d) Indemnification of Sellers Representative; Limitations of Liability. The
Sellers Representative shall be indemnified by the Sellers for and shall be
held harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Sellers
Representative or any of his Affiliates and any of their respective managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, members, partners, stockholders,
consultants, attorneys, accountants, advisors, brokers, representatives or
controlling persons, in each case, relating to the Sellers Representatives
conduct as Sellers Representative, other than losses, liabilities or expenses
that have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
result from the Sellers Representatives fraud or willful misconduct in
connection with its performance under this Agreement. This indemnification
shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The Sellers Representative
may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of
counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by

 



       
 

 



 

the Sellers Representative in accordance with such advice, and the Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers or any other person in
connection therewith. In no event shall the Sellers Representative be liable
hereunder or in connection herewith for any indirect, punitive, exemplary,
special or consequential damages. The Sellers Representative shall not be
liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted by the Sellers
Representative under this Agreement or any other document executed or
delivered hereunder, or in connection therewith, except that the Sellers
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for fraud
or willful misconduct.

 



 

(e) Access to Information. The Sellers Representative shall have access to
all information of and concerning any claim for indemnification and which is
in the possession, custody or control of Purchaser and the reasonable
assistance of Purchasers officers and employees for purposes of performing
the Sellers Representatives duties under this Agreement and exercising its
rights under this Agreement, including for the purpose of evaluating any such
claim by any Purchaser Indemnified Person; provided, however, that the
Sellers Representative shall treat confidentially and not, except in
connection with enforcing his rights under this Agreement, disclose any
nonpublic information from or concerning any such claim to anyone (except to
the Sellers Representatives attorneys, accountants or other advisers, to
Sellers and on a need-to-know basis to other individuals who agree to keep
such information confidential).

 



 

(f) Reasonable Reliance. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the
Sellers Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document or
instrument reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and
signed by any Seller or any party hereunder and (ii) assume that any Person
purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has
been duly authorized to do so.

 



 

(g) Removal of Sellers Representative; Authority of Sellers Representative.
A majority in interest of the Sellers, voting together as a single class,
shall have the right at any time to remove the then-acting Sellers
Representative and to appoint a successor Sellers Representative; provided,
however, that neither such removal of the then acting Sellers Representative
nor such appointment of a successor Sellers Representative shall be effective
until the delivery to Purchaser of executed counterparts of a writing signed
by such majority in interest of the Sellers with respect to such removal and
appointment, together with an acknowledgement signed by the successor Sellers
Representative appointed in such writing that he, she or it accepts the
responsibility of successor Sellers Representative and agrees to perform and
be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Sellers
Representative. For all purposes hereunder, a majority in interest of the
Sellers shall be determined on the basis of each Sellers Pro Rata Percentage.
Each successor Sellers Representative shall have all of the power, authority,
rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the original Sellers
Representative, and the term "Sellers Representative"

 



      
 

 



 

as used herein shall be deemed to include any interim or successor Sellers
Representative.

 



 

(h) Irrevocable Appointment. The appointment of the Sellers Representative
hereunder is irrevocable and any action taken by the Sellers Representative
pursuant to the authority granted in this Section 9.1 shall be effective and
absolutely binding as the action of the Sellers Representative under this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.2. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto, the documents, instruments and
schedules referred to herein and all other documents dated as of the date
hereof and on the Closing, including but not limited to the Earn-Out Agreement
and the Notes, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests and obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may assign its rights under this
Agreement without prior consent to (i) any Affiliate of Purchaser, (ii) its
lenders as collateral or (iii) to any Person who by purchase, merger or
otherwise directly or indirectly acquires all or substantially all of the
assets of Purchaser.

 



 

Section 9.3. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly provided
herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their
successors and permitted assignees and nothing herein expressed or implied
will give or be construed to give any Person, other than the Parties and such
successors and permitted assignees, any other right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that an Indemnified
Person that is not Party hereto is intended to be an express third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.4. _Reformation and Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be separable and a determination that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, unenforceable or void shall not affect the validity,
legality or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In case
any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or
void, it shall, to the extent possible, be modified and/or interpreted in such
manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable, but so as to most nearly retain
the intent of the Parties, and if such modification is not possible, such
provision shall be severed from this Agreement, and in either case, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Any court of
competent jurisdiction is authorized and directed by the Parties to enforce
any otherwise invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision in part, to modify
it, to enforce it only to a degree and not fully, or otherwise to enforce that
provision only in a manner and to an extent, or for a shorter period of time,
that renders the provision valid or enforceable. The intent of the Parties is
that this Agreement be enforceable and enforced to the maximum extent possible
after excising (or

 



      
 

 



 

deeming excised) all invalid or unenforceable provisions, whether or not the
remaining provisions are grammatically correct.

 



 

Section 9.5. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder and required to be made pursuant to the exhibits
hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when

will be effective upon receipt of confirmation of transmission) (c) by email,

which case, it will be effective on the second Business Day after being sent)

respect to : Intellectual Property Rights, for which the following disputes
provision shall apply: The Parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of

State of Georgia located in Fulton County in any Proceeding brought by or
against such Party in connection with, arising from or relating to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any document contemplated
herein or otherwise relating hereto, and each Party hereby waives and further
agrees not to assert as a defense in any such Proceeding any claim that such

Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

announcement related to this Agreement, or before the Closing any other
announcement or communication to the employees, customers or suppliers of the

reasonable opinion of counsel) in which case Purchaser and the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to review and comment on such press
release or announcement before publication; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall
be entitled to make such public disclosures as required by the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock

amendments necessary to conform the Agreement to the original intent of the
Parties.

 



 

Section 9.14. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing
and signed by Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers Representative. No
waiver by any Party of any breach or violation of, default under or inaccuracy

not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach or violation
of, default under, or inaccuracy in, any such representation, warranty or
covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay or omission on the part of any
Party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will
operate as a waiver thereof.

 



 

Section 9.15. _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each Party

violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically

such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that a remedy at
law would be adequate.
