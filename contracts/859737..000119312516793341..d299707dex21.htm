Buyer or any of its Affiliates, which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be
Assumed Liabilities;

(iv) all Liabilities arising out of or relating to the conduct or operation of
the Retained Business or the ownership or use of the Excluded Assets;

(v) any Liability relating to Transaction Expenses;

 

(vi) all Liabilities related to, based on or arising from any of the matters
set forth in _Schedule 2.2(b)(vi)_ ;

 

(vii) any Excluded Taxes; and

 

(viii) all Liabilities of the Seller and its Affiliates under this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



17 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.2 to the contrary, (A)
the responsibility for Liabilities that (1) are, but for this sentence,
Excluded Liabilities, (2) arose primarily from facts, circumstances or events
prior to or on the Closing Date, and (3) are expressly subject to the Existing
Collaboration Agreement shall be allocated among, and assumed by, the parties
in the same manner as such Liabilities are currently allocated under the
Existing Collaboration Agreement (any such Excluded Liabilities allocated to
the Buyer, the " _Existing Grifols Liabilities_ "), and (B) all other
Liabilities relating to the Business arising primarily from facts,
circumstances or events after the Closing Date shall be the sole
responsibility of the Buyer.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.2 or elsewhere in
this Agreement to the contrary (other than, for the avoidance doubt, with
respect to the Liabilities described in Section 2.2(b)(vi), which shall be
Excluded Liabilities):

(i) with respect to Liabilities that are, but for this Section 2.2(c), deemed
to be both (A) Assumed Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof and (B)
Excluded Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.2(b) hereof (such Liabilities, the
" _Shared Liabilities_ "), the parties shall seek any applicable recoveries
under all insurance policies covering any such Shared Liabilities, and apply
such recovery (net of expenses, deductibles, self-retention or other amounts),
prior to seeking payment directly from the other party;

(ii) to the extent the proceeds of the insurance policies described in Section
2.2(c)(i) are insufficient to fully satisfy a Shared Liability, the
responsibility for the remaining portion of such Shared Liability shall be
allocated among, and assumed by, the parties in good faith, on an equitable
basis, based upon and to the extent that the underlying assets to which such
Liabilities relate or arise from are Transferred Assets or Excluded Assets;
and

(iii) with respect to the Liabilities reflected on _Schedule 2.2(c)_ , the
responsibility for such Shared Liability shall be allocated as set forth in
_Schedule 2.2(c)_.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the matters for which indemnification is available
pursuant to Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b), 7.2(c), 7.3(a), 7.3(b) and 7.3(c)
shall not constitute Shared Liabilities.

Section 2.3 _Payment of Purchase Price; Estimated Closing Statement and
Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Payment of Purchase Price_. In consideration for the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of the Transferred Assets to the Buyer, at
the Closing, the Buyer shall (a) pay to the Seller, by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing by the Seller to the Buyer at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount equal to (i) $1,850,000,000 (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") in cash in immediately available funds in United States
dollars _plus_ __ (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Inventory set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement exceeds the Inventory Target, or _less_ (iii)
the absolute value of the amount, if any, by which the Inventory set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement is less than the Inventory Target (using the
estimates and calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement), and
(b) assume the Assumed Liabilities. In addition, on the Closing Date the Buyer
shall pay to the Seller the balance of any accounts receivable or other
amounts payable by Grifols or its Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.5(b).

 



18 (b) _Estimated Closing Statement; Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(i) _Estimated Closing Statement_. No later than three Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, the Seller will prepare in good faith and
provide to the Buyer a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail
its good faith estimate of the Inventory (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_
") and reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The calculations and
estimates set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles. After delivery of the Estimated
Closing Statement, the Seller will afford the Buyer and its Representatives
with reasonable access on reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours to the Business Books and Records related to the preparation of
the Estimated Closing Statement, _provided_ that such actions do not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Business or the Sellers
Retained Business.

(ii) _Proposed Final Closing Statement_. No later than 90 calendar days after
the Closing Date, the Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared, and will
provide to the Seller, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail
its proposed final determination of the Inventory (the " _Proposed Final
Closing Statement_ ") and reasonably detailed supporting documentation. The
Proposed Final Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. After delivery of the Proposed Final Closing Statement,
the Buyer will afford the Seller and its Representatives with reasonable
access on reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours to the
Business Books and Records related to the preparation of the Proposed Final
Closing Statement,  _provided_ that such actions do not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the Business.

(iii) _Dispute Notice_. The Proposed Final Closing Statement (and the
proposed final determination of the Inventory reflected thereon) will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties unless the Seller provides a
written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Buyer no later than the 30th
Business Day after the delivery to the Seller of the Proposed Final Closing
Statement. Any Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail (i) any
item on the Proposed Final Closing Statement which the Seller believes has
not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement and the Sellers proposed
changes to the amount of such item and (ii) the Sellers alternative
calculation of the disputed item, and in each case, with reasonably detailed
supporting documentation. Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in
the Dispute Notice or of which the Seller has accepted in writing to the Buyer
will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties on such 30th Business
Day.

(iv) _Resolution of Disputes_. If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered to the
Buyer, then the Buyer and the Seller will, during the 30 calendar days
immediately following receipt of the Dispute Notice by the Buyer (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), attempt to promptly resolve the matters raised in any
Dispute Notice in good faith. Any resolution by the Seller and the Buyer
during the Resolution Period as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding
and conclusive. If the Seller and the Buyer do not resolve all disputed items
on the Proposed Final Closing Statement by the end of the Resolution Period,
the parties will submit the disputed items to the Independent Accountants. The
Independent Accountants will promptly review only those unresolved items set
forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice, _provided_ that each party will
be afforded an opportunity to submit a written statement in favor of its
position and to advocate for its position orally before the Independent
Accountants.

 



19 (v) The Independent Accountants will have no authority to make any adjustments
to any amounts other than unresolved items and amounts specifically set forth
and objected to in the Dispute Notice. In addition, in resolving any such
disputed item, the Independent Accountants (i) shall be bound by the
provisions of this Section 2.3(b), (ii) may not assign a value to any item
greater than the highest value claimed for such item or less than the lowest
value for such item claimed by either the Buyer or the Seller, (iii) may
consider only the written and oral presentations of the Buyer and the Seller
in resolving any matter which is in dispute and (iv) shall render its decision
in writing setting forth in reasonable detail the basis upon which its
decision was made within 30 days after the disputed items have been submitted
to it. The Independent Accountants decision shall be conclusive and binding
upon each of the parties, and the Proposed Final Closing Statement shall be
modified to reflect such resolution. As used herein, the Proposed Final
Closing Statement, as adjusted to reflect any changes agreed to by the parties
and the decision of the Independent Accountants is referred to herein as the "
_Final Closing Statement_." Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with the
Independent Accountants (including by executing a customary engagement letter
reasonably acceptable to it) and to direct the Independent Accountants to
resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable after the commencement of
the engagement of the Independent Accountants.

(vi) The Independent Accountants shall allocate its fees, costs and expenses
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the merits (i.e., based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each such party bears
to the amount actually contested by such party).

(vii) _Purchase Price Adjustment_. If the Inventory (as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) and as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement) is (i) greater than the Inventory as set forth in the Estimated
Closing Statement, the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller the
difference between such amounts, or (ii) less than the Inventory as set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement, the Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to the Buyer the difference between such amounts.

 

Section 2.4 _Closing_. The sale and purchase of the Transferred Assets, and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, shall take place at a closing (the
" _Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of Proskauer Rose LLP, Eleven Times
Square, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waiver of all conditions to the obligations of the parties set
forth in Article VI (other than such conditions as may, by their nature, only
be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date), or at such other place
or at such other time or on such other date as the Seller and the Buyer
mutually may agree in writing; _provided_ that (i) unless otherwise agreed by
the Buyer, the Closing shall occur no earlier than the Extended Closing Date,
and (ii) if the Closing is delayed pursuant to clause (i), then from and
after the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than such conditions as may, by
their nature, only be satisfied at the Closing or on the Closing Date), the
Buyer shall no longer have the right to assert the failure of any conditions
set forth in Article VI as a basis not to consummate the Closing and all such
conditions shall be deemed to be irrevocably satisfied. The day on which the
Closing actually takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 



20 Section 2.5 _Consents to Certain Assignments_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall not
constitute an agreement to transfer or assign any asset, contract, permit,
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an
attempted assignment thereof, without the consent or waiver, or the taking of
a similar action, of a third party, would constitute a breach or other
contravention under any agreement or Law to which the Seller is a party or by
which it is bound, or in any way adversely affect the rights of the Seller or,
upon transfer, the Buyer under such asset, contract, permit, claim or right.
The Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consents or waivers required to assign to the Buyer any Transferred Assets
that require the consent of a third party, without any conditions to such
transfer or changes or modifications of terms thereunder.

(b) If any such consent or waiver is not obtained prior to Closing and as a
result thereof the Buyer shall be prevented by such third party from receiving
the rights and benefits with respect to such Transferred Asset intended to be
transferred hereunder, or if any attempted assignment would adversely affect
the rights of the Seller or the Buyer thereunder, then (i) for a period of 12
months following the Closing, the Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) or waiver(s), or to take
such actions, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably possible, and (ii) the
Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate in any lawful and commercially reasonable
arrangement, as the Seller and the Buyer shall agree, under which the Buyer
would, to the extent practicable, obtain the economic claims, rights and
benefits under such asset and assume the economic burdens and obligations with
respect thereto in accordance with this Agreement, including by
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the Buyer; _provided_ , that
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such cooperation and related actions
shall be paid by the Buyer. The Seller shall promptly pay to the Buyer when
received all monies received by the Seller under such Transferred Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder and the Buyer shall indemnify
and promptly pay the Seller for all Liabilities of the Seller associated with
such Transferred Asset. The Seller shall not be required to expend any
material amounts or pay any consent or similar fees in connection with its
efforts hereunder.

 

Section 2.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) The Seller and the Buyer agree that the Purchase Price (and any
adjustments thereto) and the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated for
tax purposes among the Transferred Assets. Within 90 calendar days after the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a schedule
(the " _Initial Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the sum of the Purchase
Price (and any adjustments thereto) and any Assumed Liabilities among the
Transferred Assets, in such amounts reasonably determined by the Buyer. The
Initial Allocation Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with the
principles of Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations pursuant
thereto or any successor provision. Except as provided in Section 2.6(b) or
Section 2.6(c) below, at the close of business on the 60th calendar day after
the delivery of the Initial Allocation Schedule, the Initial Allocation
Schedule shall become binding upon each of the Buyer (and its Affiliates) and
the Seller (and its Affiliates) and shall be the final allocation schedule
(the " _Final Allocation Schedule_ ").

 



21 (b) The Seller shall have a period of 30 calendar days (the " _Objection
Period_ ") from the date of delivery of the Initial Allocation Schedule to
present in writing to the Buyer, notice of any objections the Seller may have
to the allocations set forth therein. If the Seller raises any objections
within the Objection Period to the Initial Allocation Schedule, the Buyer and
the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences with
respect to the Initial Allocation Schedule within 30 calendar days after the
Seller provides written notice of such objections. If the Buyer and the
Seller reach written agreement amending the Initial Allocation Schedule within
such 30-day period, the Initial Allocation Schedule, as so amended, shall
become binding upon the Buyer (and its Affiliates) and the Seller (and its
Affiliates) and shall be the Final Allocation Schedule.

(c) If the parties fail to agree within 30 calendar days after the delivery
of the Sellers notice of any objections, then (i) the Buyer may use one
purchase price allocation and the Seller may use a different purchase price
allocation, (ii) the Buyer and the Seller shall each use (and cause their
Affiliates to use) their purchase price allocation in connection with the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns, and (iii) the Buyer shall have no
liability to the Seller, and the Seller shall have no liability to the Buyer,
for any additional Taxes that may be imposed by any Taxing authority to the
extent that such Tax arises solely as a result of the inconsistencies between
their respective purchase price allocations.

 

(d) If the Buyer and the Seller have agreed to a Final Allocation Schedule,
each party agrees to file all Returns (including IRS Form 8594 and any claims
for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation Schedule and will take no position inconsistent with the Final
Allocation Schedule unless requested to do so in any proceeding before any
Governmental Authority, in each case, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. In the event any Governmental Authority disputes the Final Allocation
Schedule, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the
other party hereto, and both the Buyer and the Seller agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend the Final Allocation Schedule in any
audit or similar proceeding. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.7 will be allocated in a manner consistent with the Final
Allocation Schedule.

Section 2.7 _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. Any payments made pursuant
to Article II (other than payment of the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant
to Section 2.3(a)) will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by
the parties for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by Law.

 

Section 2.8 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, after reasonable consultation with the Person with respect to whom
any withholding or deduction may be made, each Person who is entitled or
required to make any payment pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (each, a " _Withholding Agent_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from such payment such amounts as such Withholding Agent is required
to deduct and withhold in respect of such payment under the Code or any other
provision of applicable U.S. Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate

 



22  Governmental Authority by the Withholding Agent under the Code or any other
provision of applicable U.S. Law and original receipts or certified copies
thereof showing remittance of such Taxes are provided to the Person in
respect of whom such withholding or deduction was made, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
such Person. If the Buyer or any of its designated Affiliates or permitted
assigns pursuant to Section 9.12 (and their respective agents) is required to
withhold or deduct any amount in respect of any payment made to the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement under any provision
of applicable non-U.S. Law, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall make
additional payments to the Seller such that, after the imposition of such
withholding or deduction, the Seller receives an amount equal to the amount
it would have received if such withholding or deduction had not been imposed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such additional payments shall be required if
the Seller is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S.
withholding Tax but fails to deliver to the Buyer or its Affiliates or
permitted assigns (and their respective agents) such properly completed and
executed documentation reasonably requested by the Buyer or its Affiliates or
permitted assigns (and their respective agents) as will permit such payments
to be made without or at a reduced rate of withholding.

delivered or made available to the Buyer true, complete and correct copies of
the documents comprising each material Employee Plan, including all amendments

opinion letter from the IRS upon which it may rely regarding its qualified
status under the Code and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, nothing has
occurred that would reasonably cause the loss of such qualification; (ii) all
material payments required by each material Employee Plan, any collective
bargaining agreement or other agreement, or by Law with respect to all prior

required to be made under the HSR Act, or (ii) where failure to file, seek or

Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _Financing_.

 

(a) The Buyer has received and accepted an executed commitment letter dated as
of the date hereof (including the exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto,
the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders party thereto
(collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend amounts set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "). The Debt Financing Commitments
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter are collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_."

 



39 (b) The Buyer has delivered to the Seller true, complete and correct copies of
the executed Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letter (redacted to remove
fees and other economic terms) referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "
_Fee Letter_ "). As of the date hereof, there are no agreements, side letters
or arrangements, other than the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, to
which the Buyer or its Affiliates is a party relating to any of the Debt
Financing Commitments that could adversely affect the availability of the Debt
Financing.

 

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders
to provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would permit the
Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3, as of
the date hereof, the Buyer does not have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that
the Debt Financing will not be available to the Buyer on the Closing Date.

 

(d) The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter, together with the cash of the Buyer, will provide the Buyer with cash
proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of the Buyers
obligations to pay (i) the amount to be paid to the Seller under Section 2.3,
and (ii) any fees and expenses of or payable by the Buyer in connection with
the Debt Financing.

(e) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is (i) a valid and
binding obligation of the Buyer and, to the knowledge of the Buyer, of each
of the other parties thereto and (ii) in full force and effect (in each case,
except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)). As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of the Buyer, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
material default or material breach or a failure to satisfy a condition
precedent on the part of the Buyer under the terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter. The Buyer has paid in full any and all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter on or before the date of this Agreement and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing Date. The Debt Commitment Letter has not
been modified, amended or altered as of the date hereof, and, as of the date
hereof, none of the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter have been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.

 

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by or to the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a
condition to any of the Buyers obligations hereunder.

 

Section 4.5 _Brokers_. Except for Nomura Securities International, Inc., the
fees, commissions and expenses of which will be paid by the Buyer or Grifols,
no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders
or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Buyer or Grifols or any of its Affiliates.

 



40 Section 4.6 _The Buyer s Investigation and Reliance; Exclusivity of
Representations and Warranties_. Without in any manner limiting any of the
provisions of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and any certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(c), the Buyer is a sophisticated purchaser
and has made its own independent investigation, review and analysis regarding
the Business, the Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and
any certificates delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(c), neither the Seller nor
any of its Affiliates or Representatives has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of
any information concerning the Business, the Transferred Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities contained herein or made available in connection with the
Buyers investigation of the foregoing or otherwise relating to the Business
or the Transferred Assets (including, but not limited to, any financial
condition or results of operations of the Business or maintenance, repair,
condition, design, performance, value, merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose of the Transferred Assets), and the Seller and its
Affiliates and Representatives expressly disclaim any and all liability that
may be based on such information or errors therein or omissions therefrom. The
Buyer has not relied and is not relying on any statement, representation or
warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the Seller or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives, except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and any certificates delivered pursuant
to Section 6.3(c). Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any liability to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives resulting from the use of any information, documents or
materials made available to the Buyer, whether orally or in writing, in any
confidential information memoranda, "data rooms," management presentations,
due diligence discussions or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates or Representatives is making, directly or indirectly, any
representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections or
forecasts involving the Business or the Transferred Assets. Nothing in this
Section 4.6 is intended to modify or limit any of the representations or
warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement
and any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(c).

Molecular Detection Field; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.7(d)
shall not prevent the Buyer or its Affiliates from (A) engaging in the
Licensed Transplantation Field, or (B) holding or making investments not in
excess of 5% of the outstanding securities of any publicly-traded entity, or
taking any actions with respect to products in the Molecular Detection Field
that do not use the Licensed Intellectual Property.

 



47 (e) Each party acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
5.7 would give rise to irreparable harm to the other party or its Affiliates,
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees
that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by such party of any of
its obligations, the other party or its Affiliates may, in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of
such breach, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a temporary
restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief
that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any
requirement to post bond).

(f) Each party acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section
5.7 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the
other party and its Affiliates and constitute a material inducement to the
other party to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. In the event that any covenant contained in this Section 5.7
should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service
or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any
court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall
be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic,
product or service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The
covenants contained in this Section 5.7 and each provision hereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any
other jurisdiction.

Section 5.8 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable, including to (i)
obtain from Governmental Authorities and other Persons all consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and (ii) promptly (and in no event later than five
Business Days after the date hereof) make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law. The Buyer shall pay
all filing fees and other charges for the filing under the HSR Act for both
parties.

(b) Each of the parties shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. Neither party to this Agreement
shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the
parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information

 



48  and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with copies of
all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Certain consents and waivers with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement identified in _Schedule 3.3(a)_ or non-Material
Contracts may be required from parties to contracts to which the Seller is a
party and have not been and may not be obtained. Neither the Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall have any liability to the Buyer arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain such consents or waivers that may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or because of the termination of any such contract as a result thereof, and no
such failure or termination shall result in the failure of any condition set
forth in Article VI.

 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date, the parties shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither party
shall issue any press release or make any public statement prior to
obtaining the other partys written approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that no such approval
shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by applicable Law,
any listing agreement of any party hereto or to the extent reasonably
necessary for either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

 

Section 5.10 _Use of Names_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and in the Ancillary
Agreements, the Seller is not conveying ownership rights or granting
the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer a license to use any of the Marks of
the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the name "Hologic" or any trade
name, trademark, service mark, logo or domain name incorporating the
name "Hologic") and, after the Closing, the Buyer shall not knowingly use, or
permit any Affiliate of the Buyer to use, in any manner the Marks of the
Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller or any word that is confusingly similar
in sound or appearance to such Marks except as expressly set forth in Section
5.10(b).

(b) For a period of 180 days following the Closing Date, the Buyer and its
Affiliates may use, solely in connection with the operation of the Business as
operated immediately prior to the Closing, the Businesss existing marketing,
promotional and sales materials, stationary, letterhead, business
cards, signs, billboards, advertisements, vehicle and equipment markings,
invoices, purchase orders, forms, remaining inventory and other media,
including respective online material and substantially similar reproductions
thereof made in the ordinary course of business, in each case containing the
name "Hologic" or any Mark incorporating the name "Hologic," after which
period the Buyer shall cause the Business to remove or obliterate all such
Marks from such materials or cease using such materials.

 



49 (c) The Buyer shall ensure that all use of the Marks by the Buyer and the
Business as provided in this Section 5.10 shall be only with respect to
products and services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the
quality of products and services with respect to which the Business used such
Marks prior to the Closing. Any and all goodwill generated by the use of such
Marks under this Section 5.10 shall inure solely to the benefit of the Seller.
In any event, the Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Business not to, use
such Marks in any manner that might damage or tarnish the reputation of the
Seller or the goodwill associated with such Marks.

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) No later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall provide or cause to be provided to the Buyer an updated  _Schedule
1.1(a)_ (list of Business Employees) ( _provided_ that any additions or
deletions thereto shall be mutually agreed upon by the Buyer and the Seller).
As of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
make offers of employment to each Business Employee who is actively employed
on the Closing Date and, for Business Employees on an approved leave of
absence who are expected to return to active employment within six months, the
Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to, make offers of employment to
each Business Employee effective as of his or her return to active employment,
_provided_ that such Business Employee returns to active employment with the
Buyer or its Affiliates within six months of the Closing Date. All Business
Employees to whom the Buyer (or an Affiliate of the Buyer) offers employment
and who accept such offers of employment and become employed by the Buyer (or
an Affiliate of the Buyer), are herein referred to herein as the "
_Transferred Employees_ " and each Transferred Employee shall cease to be an
employee of the Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable, as of the Closing Date
(or, with respect to any Transferred Employee who is not actively at work on
the Closing Date, upon such individuals return to active employment with the
Buyer or its Affiliates).

(b) The Buyer shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each Transferred
Employee, for a period of 12 months following the Closing: (i) a base salary
and annual cash incentive opportunities that each are substantially comparable
to those being provided to such Transferred Employee by the Seller
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Seller
immediately prior to the Closing, _provided_  that for purposes of the
covenants of this Section 5.11(b), defined benefit pension plans, retiree
welfare benefits, long term incentive compensation and equity compensation
shall be disregarded. For a period of 12 months following the Closing
Date, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide to any Transferred Employee
who is not party to an employment agreement, who is terminated by the Buyer
and its Affiliates without "cause" (within the meaning of the severance
arrangements of the Buyer as in effect from time to time) and who timely
executes and delivers (without revocation) a release of claims against the
Buyer and its Affiliates (to the extent required by the Buyer) severance
benefits in amounts and on terms and conditions substantially comparable to
the severance benefits that would have been provided by the Seller and its
Affiliates to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



50 (c) The Seller shall reasonably cooperate with the Buyer to provide
information about the Employee Plans necessary to assist the Buyer in
complying with this Section 5.11. Following the date hereof, the Seller shall
also provide the Buyer with any additional compensation-related information
concerning Business Employees (and the compensation and benefits payable
thereto), including, without limitation, annual incentive and long term
incentives previously earned, to the extent (i) such information is reasonably
requested by the Buyer and relevant to any determination to be made by the
Buyer with respect to the compensation of any Business Employees under this
Agreement and (ii) such information is provided in accordance with any
material consent and local Law requirements applicable thereto, and the
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consents.

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by the Buyer or
its Affiliates in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Transferred Employees and their respective covered
dependents under such plan to the extent that such conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods were satisfied or did not apply under the Employee Plans in
which such Transferred Employees were participating immediately prior to the
Closing and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee and his or her covered
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan in the year in
which the Closing occurs, to the extent credited under the Employee Plans in
which such Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(e) The Buyer shall provide each Transferred Employee with credit for all
service with the Seller, or any former entity for which the Seller has
previously credited each Transferred Employee, under each employee benefit
plan, policy, program or arrangement of the Buyer and its Affiliates in which
such Transferred Employee is eligible to participate, for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and, solely for purposes of vacation and severance
entitlements, accrual of benefits, solely to the extent such past service was
recognized for such Transferred Employees under the comparable Employee Plans
in which the Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing and to the same extent past service is credited under such plans or
arrangements for similarly situated employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11(e) shall be
construed to require crediting of service for purposes of the calculation of
benefits or that would result in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii) service
credit for any purposes under any plans for which participation, service
and/or benefit accrual is frozen or any defined benefit pension plan or any
post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan, or (iii) service
credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken
into account for employees of the Buyer and its Affiliates generally.

(f) Effective as of the Closing, the Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents shall be treated as having terminated employment under
the terms of the Employee Plans, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Transition Services Agreement. On or as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, the Seller shall pay (to the extent not previously paid) to the
Transferred Employees who are eligible to receive annual incentive
compensation payments from the Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to the
Sellers annual bonus programs: (i) the annual bonuses earned by such
Transferred Employees for fiscal year 2016 under such plans, to the extent
unpaid; and (ii) a _pro rata_ portion, at target level, of annual bonuses
accrued in respect of fiscal year 2017 through the Closing Date. 

 



51 (g) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall take all necessary
action to cause the account balances and/or accrued benefits to the
Transferred Employees under the Sellers 401(k) plans and the Sellers non-
qualified defined contribution savings plans maintained for the benefit
of any of the Transferred Employees to be fully vested and non-forfeitable as
of the Closing Date, and the Seller and its Affiliates shall contribute to
such 401(k) plans and defined contribution savings plan(s) the matching
contributions relating to periods prior to the Closing Date based on the
amount of percentage that the Seller is required to contribute to such plan on
behalf of the Transferred Employees through the Closing Date as if such
employees had satisfied all prerequisites for receiving such contributions as
of the Closing Date. To the extent permitted under Section 401(k) of the Code
and regulations issued thereunder, Transferred Employees who participate in
the Sellers 401(k) plans shall be eligible to receive, at their election, a
distribution of their account balance from the Sellers 401(k) plan after the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a
401(k) plan of the Buyer or one of its Affiliates to accept eligible
rollovers of such distributions. Rollovers relating to any Transferred
Employee may include participant loans, provided that it is permitted by the
applicable 401(k) plan accepting such rollover (it being expressly understood
that the Buyer is not obligated to establish or amend any 401(k) plan to
accept such rollovers).

(h) The Seller shall be responsible for (i) the payment of any earned but
unpaid salaries, bonus, incentive pay, vacation pay, sick pay, holiday pay,
other paid time off, severance pay and other like obligations and payments to
the Business Employees, for all periods of employment by the Seller that are
due on or prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent such amounts are paid
to terminating employees generally, (ii) the payment of any amounts due to the
Transferred Employees pursuant to the Employee Plans or other employee
benefit plans of the Seller or its Affiliates as a result of its employment of
the Business Employees through and including the Closing Date and (iii) the
payment of salaries and provision of benefits to the extent provided under
the Transition Services Agreement.

(i) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall,
and hereby does, release all Transferred Employees from any confidentiality
obligations to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary for such
Transferred Employees to provide services to the Buyer in respect of the
Business, and the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, enforce any non-competition, non-solicitation, no-hire
or similar covenant with respect to any Transferred Employee or take any
other action that would reasonably restrict or limit any Transferred Employee
from providing employment or other services to the Buyer and its Affiliates.

 

(j) The Seller shall be responsible for complying with the requirements of
COBRA for its employees (including the Transferred Employees) and their
"qualified beneficiaries" whose "qualifying event" (as such terms are defined
in Section 4980B of the Code) occurs on or prior to the Closing Date and, if
applicable, upon any loss of coverage provided pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement. The Buyer shall have no liability under COBRA relating to
any Business Employees for events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date
and, if applicable, upon any loss of coverage provided pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement.

 



52 (k) The Seller agrees to provide, and shall cause its Affiliates to provide,
any required notice under and to otherwise comply with, and to retain all
Liabilities relating to, the WARN Act with respect to any event affecting the
employees of the Business prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer agrees to
provide any required notice under and to otherwise comply with, and to assume
all Liabilities relating to, such Laws with respect to any event affecting
Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date. On or as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Buyer
a true, complete and correct list of all persons who suffered an "employment
loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) during the 90-day period prior to the
Closing Date. In no event shall the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
involuntarily terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee within the
90-day period following the Closing Date that would result in material WARN
Act liabilities for the Seller or its Affiliates. In no event shall the
Seller or any of its Affiliates involuntarily terminate the employment of any
employee of the Seller of any of its Affiliates within the 90-day period
following the Closing Date that would result in material WARN Act liabilities
for the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(l) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) restrict the ability of the
Buyer to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee for any reason
at any time after the effective date of his or her employment with the Buyer,
(ii) be treated as an amendment of any Employee Plan or any employee benefit
plan of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (iii) give any third party any
right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.11, (iv) obligate the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to adopt or maintain any particular benefit plan,
program, policy or practice on or following the Closing Date, or (v) confer
upon any current or former employee of the Business, or upon any
representative of such person, any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 5.12 _Regulatory Transfers_.

 

(a) The Buyer shall file, at its own expense, as soon as possible after the
Closing, requests for the re-issuance or transfer of the Transferred Product
Registrations to show the Buyer or its Affiliates as the holder of the
Transferred Product Registrations. The Buyer shall be solely responsible for
the prosecution of such filings and for securing any such further approvals
from any relevant Governmental Authority as may be required for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operation of the Business
following the Closing. The Buyer shall take all necessary steps to obtain the
re-issuance or transfer of the Transferred Product Registrations described in
this Section 5.12 as promptly and diligently as possible. The Buyer shall
notify the Seller of the decision of any relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such re-issuance or transfer within three Business Days after such
decision. The Seller shall provide all reasonable assistance with the re-
issuance or transfer of the Transferred Product Registrations as may be
necessary or appropriate for the Buyer to effect such re-issuance or transfer
in accordance with this Section 5.12.

 



53 (b) The Buyer is hereby granted permission to conduct the Business for its own
account during the period from the Closing Date until the date on which all
Transferred Product Registrations have been transferred to or obtained by the
Buyer or its Affiliates under the Transferred Product Registrations held by
the Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date.

Section 5.13 _Tax Matters; Real Property Expenses_.

 

(a) The Seller and the Buyer shall each be responsible for, and shall each
indemnify the other for, one-half of any and all sales, use, value added,
transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, excise, real property transfer or
gains, mortgage, recordation or similar Taxes and all recording or filing
fees, notarial fees and other similar costs (including all interest,
penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts) incurred by the
Seller or the Buyer as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The party that has the primary obligation to do so under
applicable Law shall file any Returns due with respect to Taxes described in
this Section 5.13(a) and shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, any such Returns. Within 10 days of the due date
(including any applicable extensions) of any such Return filed by a party, the
non-filing party shall provide any amounts that are the obligation of
such non-filing party to the filing party.

(b) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes, or ad valorem
obligations and similar recurring Taxes and fees (other than any income Taxes,
any Taxes based on income or receipts, or any Taxes described in Section
5.13(a)) on or with respect to the Business and the Transferred Assets shall
be allocated to the Seller, on the one hand, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
and to the Buyer, on the other hand for any Post-Closing Tax Period. Any such
Taxes for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that is in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period. Any such Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period shall
be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the
Straddle Period that is in the Post-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

(c) To the extent relevant to the determination of Transferred Assets,
Excluded Assets, Assumed Liabilities or Excluded Liabilities, all other Taxes
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period as if such taxable period ends as of the close of business on the
Closing Date.

 

(d) The party that has the primary obligation to do so under applicable Law
shall file any Return that is required to be filed in respect of Taxes
described in this Section 5.13(d), and that filing party shall pay the Taxes
shown on such Return. Such party shall provide the other party with copies of
all Returns relating to any Straddle Period as soon as practicable after
the preparation, but prior to the filing, thereof, for the other partys
review. If the Buyer or the Seller remits (or has previously remitted) to the
appropriate Governmental Authority payment for Taxes which are subject to
proration under this Section 5.13(b) and such payment includes (or included)
some or all of the other partys prorated share of such Taxes, such other
party shall be liable for the prompt reimbursement of the paying party for
such other partys share of such Taxes.

 



54 (e) Subject to Section 5.2, the Seller and the Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and
filing their respective Returns and in connection with any audit with respect
to any Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes; _provided_ , ___however_ , that
such access and assistance do not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations
of the Buyer or the Seller; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event
will the Buyer or the Seller be required to disclose any Returns that are
Returns of an Affiliated Group of which the Buyer or the Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates, as applicable, is or was a member or any Buyer
Returns for a Post-Closing Tax Period. Any documents requested by the Buyer or
the Seller shall be limited to those documents that reasonably relate to the
Returns (including any workpapers connected thereto), disputes and other
matters relating to Taxes in respect of the Business and the Transferred
Assets. Nothing in this Section 5.13 shall be interpreted as requiring either
party to disclose to the other party confidential information that does not
relate to the Returns (including any workpapers connected thereto), disputes
and other matters relating to Taxes in respect of the Business and the
Transferred Assets, and either party may make appropriate redactions to
documents provided to protect such confidential information.

(f) The Buyer shall reimburse the Seller for the post-Closing portion of any
prepaid expenses associated with the Transferred Real Property, including a
prorated portion of the cost of any utilities (i.e., sewage, water, etc.).

Section 5.14  _Insurance; Risk of Loss_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Business shall cease to be insured by
the Sellers or any of its Affiliates insurance policies or by any of their
self-insurance programs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall retain
all rights to control its insurance policies and self-insurance programs,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or
otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and
self-insurance programs and the Seller shall retain any premiums or other
retentions paid by the Business prior to the Closing Date in respect of any
insurance coverage.

(b) In the event the Buyer provides written notice to the Seller of a claim
asserted in connection with the Business after the Closing arising out of an
occurrence taking place prior to the Closing (" _Post-Closing Claims_ "), the
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain recoveries under
any applicable occurrence-based insurance policies maintained by the Seller
that covered the Business to the extent such insurance coverage exists and
provides coverage and shall pay to the Buyer any net proceeds recovered
thereunder; _provided_ , that the Buyer shall (i) be responsible for the
satisfaction or payment of any and any associated self-retentions,
deductibles, costs and expenses with respect to any Post-Closing Claim and
shall reimburse the Seller for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with collecting insurance proceeds in respect of such
claims and (ii) the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Seller with
respect to the tendering of any such claims including providing notices,
information and backup materials as may be necessary in connection therewith.

 



55 (c) The Seller agrees that with respect to any act, omission, event or
occurrence that results in a material Loss relating to any Transferred Asset
that first occurs, and that the Seller first becomes aware of, during the
period beginning on the date hereof and ending as of the Closing that is
covered by insurance policies under which the applicable Transferred Asset is
insured prior to the Closing, (i) the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly notify the Buyer of the occurrence of such event, and (ii)
the Seller shall promptly make claims under such policies in respect of such
act, omission, event, occurrence or Loss, subject to the terms and conditions
of such policies, and, to the extent any insurance proceeds are received by
the Seller in respect of such claims, then the Seller shall (but conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing), promptly after the Sellers receipt
thereof, remit to the Buyer the amount of such proceeds (net of any
deductibles or expenses), _less_ any amounts thereof actually paid to third
parties who perform repairs or other similar work in connection with
restoring the applicable Transferred Asset to its prior condition. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Seller pays any insurance proceeds to
the Buyer or uses such insurance proceeds for repair or restoration of any
Transferred Asset that suffers a casualty loss, the Buyer shall be deemed to
have waived any other rights or remedies with respect to such matter,
including any rights to indemnification or the ability to assert the failure
of a closing condition in respect thereof.

Section 5.15 _Further Assurances; Wrong Pockets_.

 

(a) The Seller and the Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance and
transfer and take such additional action as may be reasonably necessary to
effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the sale and transfer to the Buyer of
the Transferred Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if at any time
following the Closing it becomes apparent that any asset (including any
Contract) that should have been transferred to the Buyer, either directly or
indirectly pursuant to this Agreement was not so transferred, or any asset
(including any Contract), including those related to the Retained Business,
was inadvertently transferred to the Buyer, the Seller shall, and shall cause
its applicable Affiliates to, or the Buyer shall, and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to, as applicable, in each case as promptly as
practicable: (i) transfer all rights, title and interest in such asset to the
Buyer or as the Buyer may direct, or to the Seller or as the Seller may
direct, as applicable, in each case for no additional consideration; and (ii)
hold its right, title and interest in and to such asset in trust for the
applicable transferee until such time as such transfer is completed.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, if the Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives or collects any funds relating to any Transferred Asset (other than
any accounts receivable which constitute Excluded Assets), the Seller or its
Affiliate shall remit such funds to the Buyer within five Business Days after
its receipt thereof. From and after the Closing, if the Buyer or its Affiliate
receives or collects any funds relating to any Excluded Asset, the Buyer or
its Affiliate shall remit any such funds to the Seller within five Business
Days after its receipt thereof.

 



56 Section 5.16 _Grifols Guarantee_.

 

(a) In consideration of the Sellers execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Grifols hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Seller (A)
the due and punctual payment and performance of each of the obligations owing
by Buyer under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements if, as and when
such obligations become due and (B) the due and punctual payment of all
Losses incurred by the Seller resulting from the breach or default by the
Buyer of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Losses covered by the indemnity
provided under Section 7.3 (collectively, the " _Buyer Obligations_ ").

(b) In connection with a termination (in whole or in part) of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, Grifolss obligations under this Section 5.16 shall
terminate with respect to those Buyer Obligations that have been relieved in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 8.2. For the avoidance
of doubt, the guaranty under this Section 5.16 and the rights of the Seller
under this Section 5.16 shall continue to apply to all those Buyer Obligations
surviving a termination (in whole or in part) of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1.

(c) Grifols hereby agrees that its obligations under this Section 5.16 shall
be unconditional, irrespective of (A) the absence of any action to enforce
the Buyer Obligations against Buyer, (B) any amendment, waiver or consent by
the Buyer or the holder of a Buyer Obligation with respect to any provision
thereof, (C) the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Buyer, or (D) any
other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor. Grifols hereby waives
promptness, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filings of claims with
any court, any right to require a proceeding first against Buyer, protest or
notice with respect to the applicable Buyer Obligation and all demands
whatsoever, and covenants that Grifolss obligations under this Section 5.16
will not be discharged except by complete performance of the applicable Buyer
Obligations and the obligations under this Section 5.16 in accordance with the
terms thereof and hereof, respectively.

 

(d) Grifols shall be subrogated to all rights against the Buyer in respect of
any amounts paid by Grifols pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.16.

(e) The obligations of Grifols under this Section 5.16 constitute a guarantee
of payment and performance when due and not of collection. The Buyer
Obligations of Grifols under this Section 5.16 shall continue to be effective,

Section 5.17 and this Section 5.18, including any professional and accounting

liability to the Seller (whether potential or otherwise), (ii) the Buyers
obligations under this Agreement shall not be conditioned upon Buyers ability

61 Section 7.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_. The Seller shall save, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages,
Liabilities, Taxes, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments,
penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing
or defending the foregoing) (hereinafter collectively, " _Losses_ ") to the
extent based upon, resulting from, with respect to or by reason of:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller contained
in this Agreement;

 

(b) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Seller contained
in the Intellectual Property License;

 

(c) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Seller contained in this
Agreement or in the Intellectual Property License; and

 

(d) any Excluded Liability.

 

Section 7.3 _Indemnification by the Buyer_. The Buyer shall save, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses to the

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Buyer or Grifols

(c) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Buyer or Grifols contained
in this Agreement or in the Intellectual Property License; and 

(d) any Assumed Liability.

 

Section 7.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement as a result of a Loss or a claim or demand made by any
Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the party against whom
indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, describing
in reasonable detail the 

 



62  facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder and the amount
or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known). In connection
with the delivery of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Indemnifying Party such
other necessary information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article
VII, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
by such failure.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that
the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the
defense of any Third Party Claim (i) that is asserted directly by or on
behalf of a Person that is a material supplier or material customer of the
Indemnified Party or (ii) that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party, in which case the Indemnified Party may defend
such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party will consult with the
Indemnifying Party regarding any such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel
is required; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense of any such Third Party Claim at its
own expense and the Indemnified Party will consult with the Indemnifying Party
regarding any such defense.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that if in the
reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party, there is a conflict
of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses
of one counsel to such Indemnified Party in connection with such defense. The
Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including
making available (subject to the provisions of this Section 7.4) records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other
than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle, or make any admission of liability, agreement or
compromise in respect of, any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this Section 7.4(d).
If a firm offer is made to settle, or make any admission of liability,
agreement or compromise in respect of, a Third Party Claim without leading to
liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations in
connection with such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to
accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written
notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party
gives written notice to the Indemnifying

 



63  Party within 10 days after its receipt of such notice that it does not
consent to such settlement, admission, agreement or compromise, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim at
its own expense, and in such event the maximum liability of the Indemnifying
Party as to such Third Party Claim and any related claims that such proposed
settlement, admission, agreement or compromise would settle or
otherwise preclude shall not exceed the amount of such offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to give written notice to the Indemnifying Party that
it does not consent to such settlement, admission, agreement or compromise
within such 10-day period, the Indemnifying Party may settle, or make any
admission of liability, agreement or compromise in respect of, the Third Party
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer in respect of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to this Section 7.4, it shall not agree to any settlement, admission,
agreement or compromise without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve or result from a Third
Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim
promptly to the Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder and the amount or
method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known). In connection
with the delivery of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Indemnifying Party such
other necessary information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article
VII, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond in writing within 30 days of receipt of such notice. The Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in
determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party
and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation
shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information,
records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist
in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing
legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.5 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) No claim may be asserted against any party for breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, unless written
notice of such claim is received by such party, describing in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such
claim (to the extent known) on or prior to the date on which the
representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim is based ceases to
survive as set forth in Section 7.1, in which case such representation,
warranty or covenant shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been
finally resolved.

 



64 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 

(i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from the Seller by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 7.2(a),
or from the Buyer by the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section
7.3(a), shall be $185,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ that the Cap shall
not be applicable in respect of any breach of a Fundamental Representation;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Losses that may be recovered from the Seller by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) in respect of any breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in the last sentence of Section 3.14(d) and Section
3.15 (together with all other recoveries for breaches of representations and
warranties subject to the Cap) shall be $277,500,000;

 

(ii) the Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 7.2(a), and the Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 7.3(a), for any claim for indemnification (x) unless
and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered
from the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, equals or exceeds
$18,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case the Seller or the Buyer,
as applicable, shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of the Basket
Amount or (y) in respect of any claim that results in Losses of less than
$50,000;  _provided_ that the foregoing limitations in clauses (x) and (y)
shall not be applicable in respect of any breach of a Fundamental
Representation or any breach of the representations and warranties set forth
in the last sentence of Section 3.14(d); and _provided_ , _further_ , that in
no event shall there be duplication of payments with respect to items
considered as part of any Inventory adjustment under Section 2.3 and amounts
paid with respect to indemnification claims under this Article VII;

(iii) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, exemplary, special or
indirect damages, including business interruption, diminution of value, loss
of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or
opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement
(except (i) to the extent actually awarded to a Governmental Authority or
other third party or (ii) with respect to breaches of (x) the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (related to intellectual property)
or (y) any covenant or agreement contained in the Intellectual Property
License, with respect to which consequential damages that are reasonably
foreseeable shall be available to a party in seeking a remedy hereunder); and

(iv) in no event shall the Seller be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 7.2 or otherwise for any claim for indemnification for or
other Liability in respect of Taxes attributable to the operation or conduct
of the Business or the Transferred Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(c) The amount of any and all Losses under this Article VII shall be
determined net of (i) any Tax benefit actually realized by the applicable
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual,
incurrence or payment of any such Losses, and (ii) any insurance proceeds
payable recoveries to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection
with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (less any related
costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of pursuing any related
insurance claims and any related increases in insurance premiums or other
chargebacks). Each party hereby waives, to the extent permitted under its
applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may
have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. For this purpose, (i) the
applicable Indemnified Party 

 



65  or its Affiliate shall be deemed to recognize all other items of loss,
deduction or credit before recognizing any deduction or loss arising from the
incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss for which indemnification is
provided under this Article VII, and (ii) the applicable Indemnified Party or
its Affiliate shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax benefit if
(A) realized in the year of the indemnified Loss, and (B) to the extent that,
with respect to any taxable period of such Indemnified Party or such Affiliate
ending on or before two years from the Closing Date, the amount of Taxes
payable by such Indemnified Party or such Affiliate is reduced below the
amount of Taxes that such Indemnified Party or such Affiliate would have been
required to pay but for the incurrence or payment of such Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VII.

 

(d) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim, liability or Loss for which indemnification may be
required hereunder. The Buyer and the Seller shall cause the applicable
Indemnified Party to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery
under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they
would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

Section 7.6 _No Right of Set-Off_. Each of the Buyer and the Seller, for
itself and for its Affiliates, successors and assigns hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or
similar rights that the Buyer or the Seller (or any of their respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns) has or may have with respect to the
payments under the Ancillary Agreements, any other payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith or otherwise.

Section 7.7 _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable by a final non-appealable order, subject to
the terms of this Article VII, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its
payment obligations under this Article VII within 10 Business Days after such
agreement or final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

 

Section 7.8 _Materiality_. For purposes of determining the amount of Losses in
respect of indemnification under this Article VII, but not for purposes of
determining whether a breach of the terms of this Agreement has occurred, the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been made without any qualifications as to materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualifications other than with respect to the last sentence
of Section 3.6, pursuant to which such qualifications shall be included for
all purposes hereunder.

 

Section 7.9 _Exclusivity_ _and Nature of Payment_. Except as specifically set
forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, effective as of the
Closing, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified
Parties, and the Seller, on behalf of the other Seller Indemnified Parties,
waive any rights and claims any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party, as applicable, may have against the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable,
regardless of the Law or legal theory under which such liability or obligation
may be sought to be imposed, whether at law, in equity, contract, tort
or otherwise, relating to the Transferred Assets, the Business and/or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
After the Closing, other than any claims arising from fraud in this Agreement
or

 



66  criminal activity on the part of a party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, this Article VII will provide the
exclusive remedy against the Seller or the Buyer, as applicable, for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby. Any
indemnity or other payments made under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(b) (i) by the Seller, if the Buyer breaches or fails to perform in any
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2, (B) cannot be or has not been
cured by the earlier to occur of (i) the Termination Date and (ii) 30 days
following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform (

warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or
failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
