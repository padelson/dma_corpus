purchase has been made in compliance with SECTION 7.1(c) for any Revenue
Period and within sixty (60) days from the Revenue Date for such period (the
"OBJECTION NOTICE PERIOD"), either Investor may give the Company written
notice that such Investor or both Investors object to the calculation of
Qualifying Revenues set forth in such Qualifying Revenue Report (the

use reasonable efforts to resolve any objections. If the parties are unable
to resolve the dispute within twenty (20) days from the date of the Objection

standing to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to agree on the
choice of such an accounting firm, they will select an accounting firm of

parties) (the "ACCOUNTANT") which shall determine the Qualifying Revenue for
the applicable Revenue Period. The Accountant shall deliver to each of the
parties its determination within twenty (20) days after being selected, and
the determination of the Accountant shall be binding upon the parties. The
expenses of the Accountant shall be borne equally by the parties, provided
that if the Investors' objection is resolved in the Investors' favor, the
Company shall reimburse the Investor to the extent required so that the
amount paid by the Investor pursuant to Section 7.1 less the amount of such
reimbursement is in accordance with the resolution of the dispute.

                           (e)      The Company shall maintain complete and
accurate accounting records in accordance with sound accounting principles
and will preserve such records for a period of at least two (2) years. The
Investors may semi-annually, or at such additional time at the Investors'
request, audit, or hire an independent auditor to audit, the operations,
books and records of the Company required to be maintained pursuant to this
Section.

Company (A) listed on a schedule approved by the Company and the Investors on

in clause (ii) above. Any amounts credited as "Revenue" pursuant to clause
(i) above for which cash is not collected ("Uncollectable Amount") by the end
of the quarter immediately following the Revenue Period in which such
"Revenue" is recognized (the "Next Revenue Period"), shall result in an
increase in the Revenue Target (on a dollar for dollar basis) for the Revenue
Period immediately following the Next Revenue Period equal to the

Period, the amount, if any, by which the Qualifying Revenue is [*] than the

amount of Qualifying Revenues that the Company receives for prior Revenue
Periods pursuant to Section 7.1(c), exceeds the sum of the Revenue Targets
for all prior Revenue Periods.

                                    (ix)     U.S. GAAP: Generally accepted
accounting principles of the United States of America.

equity or otherwise or which may arise out of or in connection with such
termination.

                  9.3      LANGUAGE. This Agreement is in the English
language only, which language shall be controlling in all respects, and all
versions hereof in any other language shall be for accommodation only and
shall not be binding upon the parties. All communications and notices to be
made or given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language.

                  9.4      SEVERABILITY. If any provision in this Agreement
shall be found or be held to be invalid or unenforceable (including, without
limitation, as a result of objections by the Japanese Fair Trade Commission)
then the meaning of said provision shall be construed, to the extent
feasible, so as to render the provision enforceable, and if no feasible
interpretation would save such provision, it shall be severed from the
remainder of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect
unless the severed provision is essential and material to the rights or
benefits received by any party. In such event, the parties shall use best
efforts to negotiate, in good faith, a substitute, valid and enforceable
provision or agreement which most nearly affects the parties' intent in
entering into this Agreement.

                  9.5      REFERENCES; SUBJECT HEADINGS. Unless otherwise
indicated, references to Sections and Exhibits herein are to Sections of and
Exhibits to, this Agreement. The subject headings of the Sections of this
Agreement are included for the purpose of convenience of reference only, and
shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any of its provisions.

                  9.6      FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties shall each perform
such acts, execute and deliver such instruments and documents, and do all
such other things as may be reasonably necessary to accomplish the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

                  9.7      EXPENSES. Each of the parties will bear its own
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and expenses of legal
counsel, accountants, brokers, consultants and other representatives used or
hired in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. All such expenses
incurred by the Company shall be borne by the Company to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law including, without limitation, expenses relating
to the formation of the Company, any transfer taxes for transfer of the
Company stock to the parties, registration charges, taxes, fees and expenses
relating to required governmental or regulatory approvals, notary fees and
legal fees and expenses.

                  9.8      NO WAIVER. No waiver of any term or condition of
this Agreement shall be valid or binding on a party unless the same shall
have been set forth in a written document, specifically referring to this
Agreement and duly signed by the waiving party. The failure of a party to
enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement, or the failure
to require at any time performance by one or both of the other parties of any
of the provisions of this Agreement, shall in no way be construed to be a
present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in any way affect the
ability of a party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter.

                  9.9      ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. The terms and
conditions contained in this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto), the other Transaction Agreements and the Ariba Non-Disclosure
Agreement dated October 19, 2000 by and between Ariba and the

Investors constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede
all previous agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No agreement or
understanding amending this Agreement shall be binding upon any party unless
set forth in a written document which expressly refers to this Agreement and
which is signed and delivered by duly authorized representatives of each
party.

                  9.10     ASSIGNMENT. No party shall assign this Agreement
or any rights or obligations hereunder without the other parties' prior
written consent, except that (i) the Company may assign this Agreement to a
Person into which it has merged or which has otherwise succeeded to all or
substantially all of the Company's business or assets and (ii) the Investors
may assign this Agreement to a Person that is a wholly owned subsidiary of
SOFTBANK Parent or a Person who has succeeded to all or substantially all of
SOFTBANK Parent's business or assets. All assignees under this SECTION 9.10
must assume in writing or by operation of law, the assigning party's
obligations under this Agreement, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the assigning party
shall remain liable for the assignee's performance of its obligations
hereunder. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding
upon, the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

                  9.11     NO AGENCY. The parties are independent
contractors. Nothing contained herein or done in pursuance of this Agreement
shall constitute any party the agent of any other party for any purpose or in
any sense whatsoever.

                  9.12     NO BENEFICIARIES. Nothing herein express or
implied, is intended to or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
person, firm, corporation or legal entity, other than the parties and their
affiliates who hold securities (and, in the case of the Investors, any
affiliates of SOFTBANK Parent), any interests, rights, remedies or other
benefits with respect to or in connection with any agreement or provision
contained herein or contemplated hereby.

                  9.13     COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, and each counterpart shall constitute an original
instrument, but all such separate counterparts shall constitute only one and
the same instrument.
