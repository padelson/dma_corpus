AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (as amended or modified in accordance with its terms, this  _"Agreement"_ ) is made and entered into as of March 2, 2011 by and among Valitas Health Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( _"Parent"_ ), Whiskey Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), and America Service Group Inc., a Delaware corporation ( _"Company"_ ). 

  

 A. The board of directors of Parent has unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the _"Merger"_ ), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and has determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and its sole stockholder. 

  

 B. The board of directors of Merger Sub has unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and has determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, Merger Sub and Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. 

  

 C. The board of directors of Company has unanimously approved and declared advisable the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and has determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, Company and its stockholders. 

  

 D. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them on  _Exhibit A_ attached hereto. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the parties hereto, intending legally to be bound, agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
  _THE MERGER_  

   

 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ( _"DGCL"_ ): (i) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company; (ii) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease; and (iii) Company shall be the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Company, as the surviving entity of the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the _"Surviving Entity"_. 

  

 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereof, the closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the  _"Closing"_ ) will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the parties hereto (the _"Closing Date"_ ), which shall be no later than the second business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Articles VI_ and _VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent may in its sole and absolute discretion elect to postpone the Closing Date 

   ##### 

  

    

by up to five (5) calendar days (or, if the fifth (5th) calendar day is not a
business day, the next business day thereafter) following the Closing Date
that would otherwise have applied pursuant to this _Section 1.2_; and
_provided_ _further_  that Parent may not exercise its rights to postpone the
Closing Date pursuant to the preceding proviso more than two (2) times (i.e.,
not for a total of more than ten (10) calendar days) or to a date later than
the Outside Date. The Closing shall take place at the offices of Bradley
Arant Boult Cummings LLC, Suite 700, 1600 Division Street, Nashville,
Tennessee, or at such other location as the parties hereto shall mutually
agree. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger substantially in the form of 
_Exhibit B_ (the _"Certificate of Merger"_ ) with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the _"Delaware Secretary"_ ), in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filings, or such later time
as may be agreed in writing by the parties hereto and specified in the
Certificate of Merger, being the _"Effective Time"_ ). If the Delaware
Secretary requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger as a condition to
filing or issuing a certificate to the effect that the Merger is effective,
Merger Sub, Parent and/or Company shall execute any necessary document
incorporating such changes, provided such changes are not inconsistent with
and do not result in any material change in the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and in accordance with the DGCL, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity. 

  

 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Company shall be amended to read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Company shall be amended to read in their entirety as set forth on _Exhibit D_ hereto and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 1.5 _Board of Directors and Officers of the Surviving Entity_. The board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall serve as the initial board of directors of the Surviving Entity, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The officers of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall serve as the initial officers of the Surviving Entity, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

  

ARTICLE II 
  _CONVERSION OF SECURITIES_  

   

 2.1 _Conversion of Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holders of any outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or capital stock of Merger Sub: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.1(b)_ or _Section 2.3_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $26.00 in cash, without interest (such per share amount, the  _"Merger Consideration"_ ). As of the Effective Time, all such converted shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a _"Certificate"_ ) and each such uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (an _"Uncertificated Share"_ ), which immediately prior to the Effective Time was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of Company, shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor in accordance with _Section 2.2_. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock held by Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or owned by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

   

 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Entity and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Entity. 

   

 2.2 _Payment of Consideration_. 

  

 (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the paying agent for the purpose of delivering the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for Certificates or Uncertificated Shares (the _"Paying Agent"_ ). 

   

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall supply or cause to be supplied to or for the account of the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be applied promptly to making the payments provided for in _Section 2.1(a)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in: (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America; (ii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion; or (iii) money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent or Parents designee and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent or Parents designee. In the event that the funds in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to the deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount to make such payment. 

      ##### 

  

     

 (c) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2) business days following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent and will be in customary form and have such other customary provisions as Parent reasonably specifies) for use in the exchange of such holders Certificates or Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration. Thereafter, each such holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon: (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal (and all other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent); or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration without interest. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that: (x) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred; and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) The transfer books of Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time thereafter on the records of Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, without interest, to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this  _Article II_. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock following the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or Parents designee, and any such holder who has not exchanged Certificates or Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent, as unsecured creditors thereof, for payment of such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Entity nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Government Authority, any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become, to the extent 

  ##### 

  

    

permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ( _"Dissenting Shares"_ ) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment for the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, except that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by Company for appraisal of shares and withdrawals of any such demand, and any other communications delivered to Company pursuant to or in connection with Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands (including settlement offers). Except with the prior written consent of Parent, Company shall not offer to settle or settle, nor (unless required pursuant to a valid and final court Order) make any payment with respect to, any such demands. 

  

 2.4 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares; Company ESPP_.

 (d) Promptly following the Effective Time, but in no event more than one (1) business day following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall otherwise take all steps necessary to ensure that the Surviving Entity has sufficient cash to pay the aggregate Designated Consideration payable to all optionholders pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_.

 2.5 _Required Withholdings_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and the Designated Consideration such amounts, if any, as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any other Applicable Law.

 2.7 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Company shall occur, as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement.

Each of Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (b) Neither Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement or other charter documents (in each case, as applicable). _Schedule 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Statement sets forth: (i) the full name of each Company Subsidiary and any other entity in which Company has a significant equity interest, its capitalization and the ownership interest of Company and each other Person (if any) therein; (ii) the jurisdiction in which each such Company Subsidiary is organized; (iii) each jurisdiction in which Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is qualified to do business as a foreign Person; and (iv) the names of the current directors and officers of Company and of each Company Subsidiary (or their equivalents if the Company Subsidiary is not a corporation).

Each of the Company SEC Reports complied as to form, when filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such subsequent filing), in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the _"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"_ ) and in each case, any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, each as in effect on the date so filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent filing).

As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that Companys independent registered accountant, chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when required. To the knowledge of Company,

ARTICLE IV 
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_ 
  _OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_  

   

 Parent and Merger Sub make to Company the representations and warranties contained in this  _Article IV_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 4.1 _Organization, Etc_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub was duly organized or formed, is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority or qualification would not result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept), in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 (b) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any provision of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws. Parent has made available to Company accurate and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as currently in effect, of Parent and Merger Sub. 

   

 4.2 _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions and obligations contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly authorized by the unanimous vote of the board of directors of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, which will occur immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Company, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors rights generally, by general equitable principles or by principles of good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law). 

  

 4.3 _No Violations, Etc_. No filing with or notification to, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Government Authority is necessary on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby except: (i) for the filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL; (ii) as is required for complying with the HSR Act; and (iii) where the failure to make such filing or notification or to obtain such permit, authorization, consent or approval would not result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, nor the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby by Parent and Merger Sub, nor compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with all of the provisions hereof and thereof will, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which will occur immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement): (x) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub; (y) violate any 

   ##### 

  

    

Applicable Law; or (z) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or
result in any material change in, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration, redemption or repurchase under, any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of any binding contract, agreement or
commitment of Parent or Merger Sub, except in the case of clauses (y) or (z)
for any violation, breach or default that would not result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 4.4 _Board Approval_. The board of directors of Parent has unanimously: (i) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; and (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and Parents sole stockholder. The board of directors of Merger Sub has unanimously approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and determined that this Agreement is fair to and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole stockholder. 

  

 4.5 _Company Proxy Statement_. The information regarding Parent and Merger Sub supplied by Parent in writing for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement, at the date the Company Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to Companys stockholders and at the time of the Company Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

  

 4.6 _Litigation_. 

  

 (a) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, any investigation or Action threatened against Parent, any of the Subsidiaries of Parent (the _"Parent Subsidiaries"_ ) or any of their respective officers, directors and managers (in their capacities as such), or involving any of their assets or capital stock, before any Government Authority, except for those Actions which would not result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened which in any manner challenges, seeks to, or is reasonably likely to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent or delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing their obligations hereunder. 

   

 (b) There is no outstanding Order to which Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their assets is or was a party, or by which Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, or any of their assets is bound, the terms of which have not been satisfied by Parent or Parent Subsidiary. 

   

 4.7 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to Company true, correct and complete copies of the commitment letters (the _"Debt Commitment Letters"_ ) from Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America, N.A.  on one hand, and GSO Capital Partners LP, on the other hand (each of the foregoing Persons, a _"Lender"_ ), each dated as of the date of this Agreement, pursuant to which the Lenders have 

     ##### 

  

    

committed, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters, to provide debt financing in the aggregate amount
set forth therein for the purpose of consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the _"Debt Financing"_ ). As of
the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters have not been amended
or modified and the commitments set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Each Debt Commitment
Letter, in the form delivered to Company, is, as of the date of this
Agreement, in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of
Parent as of the date hereof, the other parties thereto. Assuming compliance
by Company with its covenants and agreements hereunder and the accuracy in
all material respects of the representations and warranties of Company set
forth in _Article III_ (for such purposes, the accuracy of
such representations and warranties shall otherwise be evaluated without
giving effect to any knowledge or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualification or exception), the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt
Financing, together with other funds currently available to Parent and the
cash and cash equivalents of Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be
sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_, any other repayment or
refinancing of indebtedness required by the Debt Commitment Letters or
required as a result of the consummation of the Merger (collectively, the 
_"Debt Payoff"_ ) and any other amounts payable by Parent or Merger Sub at the
Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Except as specifically set forth in each Debt Commitment Letter: (i) there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the obligations of the Lenders to fund the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters; (ii) there are no contingencies that would permit the Lenders either to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or to impose any additional conditions precedent or contingency to the availability of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters; and (iii) there are no side letters or other contracts, agreements or commitments relating to the Debt Financing other than the Debt Commitment Letters and the fee letter between Parent and Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital,  Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated. Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ (for such purposes, the accuracy of such representations and warranties shall otherwise be evaluated without giving effect to any knowledge or Company Material Adverse Effect qualification or exception), as of the date of this Agreement: (x) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letters; and (y) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions, statements, representations or warranties in the Debt Commitment Letters inaccurate in any material respect or that would reasonably be expected to cause the commitment provided in the Debt Commitment Letters to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters not to be met. Parent and Merger Sub have paid any and all commitment and other fees that have been incurred and are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Commitment Letters. 

   

 4.8 _Finders or Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has employed or retained any investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary who is or 

   ##### 

  

    

might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Company could have any
liability. 

  

 4.9 _Solvency_. Assuming: (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions; (ii) the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties of Company set forth in _Article III_ (for such purposes, the accuracy of such representations and warranties shall otherwise be evaluated without giving effect to any knowledge or Company Material Adverse Effect qualification or exception); (iii) any estimates, projections or forecasts of Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable; and (iv) compliance by Company with its covenants and agreements hereunder, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the Merger Consideration, the Debt Payoff, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Entity will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term _"Solvent"_ when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination and on a consolidated basis, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities" as of such date, as such quoted items are generally determined in accordance with Applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the business in which it is engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature," means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due. 

  

 4.10 _Investigation; No Additional Representations_. Parent and Merger Sub, in entering into this Agreement, are relying solely on the representations and warranties of Company set forth in  _Article III_ of this Agreement and, except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Statement), Company has made no representation or warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, with respect to Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or financial conditions, assets, liabilities or operations, or the past, current or future profitability or performance of their respective businesses or any other matter, including with respect to: (i) any information, written or oral and in any form provided, made available to Parent or any of its Representatives in "data rooms" (including online data rooms), management presentations, functional "break-out" discussions, oral or written responses to questions submitted on behalf of Company or other communications between Parent or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and Company or any of its Representatives, on the other hand; (ii) any projections, estimates, business plans or budgets delivered to or made available to Parent or any of its Representatives, or which is made available to Parent or any of its Representatives after the date hereof, or future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of Company or any of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Subsidiaries; (iii) the operation of Company or any Company
Subsidiaries by Parent after the Closing in any manner; (iv) the probable
success or profitability of the ownership, use or operation of Company or
any Company Subsidiaries by Parent after the Closing; (v) the accuracy or
completeness of any other information, written or oral and in any form
provided, or documents previously made available or which is made available
after the date hereof to Parent or any of its Representatives with respect to
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or other related matters, whether
in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise; or (vi) any other information, written or oral and in any form
provided, or documents previously made available or which are made available
after the date hereof, to Parent or any of its Representatives with respect to
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or other related matters, whether in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise.

 (iii) _"Excluded Party"_ means any Person, group of Persons or group that includes any Person (so long as such Person and the other members of such group, if any, who were members of such group immediately prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date constitute at least seventy percent (70%) of the equity financing of such group at all times following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the termination of this Agreement) from whom Company has received prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date a written Acquisition Proposal that the Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof determines in its good faith judgment prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, after consultation with its Financial Advisor, is or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, such Person or group shall cease to be an "Excluded Party" upon the earlier of: (x) the Cut-Off Date and (y) immediately at such time as the Acquisition Proposal made by such Person or group (as such Acquisition Proposal may be revised during the course of ongoing negotiations) no longer constitutes or would no longer reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, in each case as determined in good faith by Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof after consultation with its Financial Advisor (it being understood that such Acquisition Proposal may temporarily cease to be a Superior Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, in each case as determined in good faith by Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof after consultation with its Financial Advisor, so long as negotiations with respect thereto are ongoing and there is not, following the No-Shop Period Start Date, a continuous period of five (5) business days during which such Acquisition Proposal fails to be a Superior Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that 

    ##### 

  

      

would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, in each case
as determined in good faith by Companys board of directors or any properly
constituted committee thereof after consultation with its Financial
Advisor). 

   

 (iv) _"Superior Proposal"_ means a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 15% to 50%) that is not solicited or received in violation of _Section 5.2_ and that Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its Financial Advisor and outside counsel (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing terms thereof) and regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, the expected timing and likelihood of consummation of the proposal and the identity of the Person making the proposal, and (B) would result in a transaction more favorable to Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account the timing of consummation as compared to the transaction contemplated hereby and after giving effect to all of the adjustments offered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 5.2(i)_); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a "Superior Proposal" if any financing required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal is not likely in the reasonable judgment of Companys board of directors (after consultation with its Financial Advisor) to be obtained on a timely basis. 

  

 (e) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.2(e)_ or _Section 8.1(i)_ or  _Section 8.1(j)_, Companys board of directors and each committee thereof shall not: 

   

 (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (B) authorize, adopt, approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) any Acquisition Proposal, (C) after the public announcement of the submission of an Acquisition Proposal, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) business days after Parent so requests in writing, (D) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal on a Schedule TO or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a _"Recommendation Change"_ ); or 

  

 (ii) unless it concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ or  _Section 8.1(j)_, cause or permit Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.2(a)_ or _Section 5.2(c)_) relating to any Acquisition Proposal. 

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof
may effect a Recommendation Change if: (i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal is
made to Company and is not withdrawn, (B) neither Company nor its Subsidiaries
or Representatives has breached the terms of this _Section 5.2_, (C)
Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof
has determined in good faith (after 

  ##### 

  

   

consultation with its Financial Advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal (giving effect to all of the adjustments offered by Parent
pursuant to _Section 5.2(i)_) and (D) in light of such Superior Proposal,
Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof
has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel)
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law; or (ii) (A) an Intervening Event shall have
occurred following the date of this Agreement and (B) in light of such
Intervening Event, Companys board of directors or any properly
constituted committee thereof has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and after giving effect to all of the
adjustments offered by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.2(j)_ )) that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Company shall provide Parent with at least two (2)
business days prior notice of any meeting of Companys board of directors or
any committee at which it is reasonably expected that any Acquisition
Proposal or Intervening Event will be considered. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ shall be deemed to prohibit Company or Companys board of directors or any committee thereof from: (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders); or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of Company), provided that Companys board of directors expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure and that any Recommendation Change shall only be made in accordance with the requirements of _Section 5.2(e)_. 

   

 (g) Within twenty-four (24) hours following the No-Shop Period Start Date, Company shall notify Parent of the number of Excluded Parties and the identity thereof and shall provide Parent with a written summary of the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal received from an Excluded Party and, if applicable, copies of all documents relating thereto received prior to such date. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent of any inquiries, proposals, offers or requests for non-public information with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal that are received by Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, or of any discussions or negotiations sought or occurring with respect thereto, indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms and conditions of such inquiry, proposal, offer or request (including, if applicable, copies of any written materials submitted in connection with such inquiry, proposal, offer or request, including proposed agreements) and the identity of the Person submitting such inquiry, proposal, offer or request and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed in a reasonably prompt manner of the status and terms of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations. 

   

 (h) Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement to which Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the 

  ##### 

  

    

request of Parent, unless, in the case of a "standstill" or similar
agreement, (i) the release is for, and limited to the extent such Person
remains, an Excluded Party or (ii) Companys board of directors determines in
good faith based on the advice of outside legal counsel that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the boards fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Company shall not
release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or permit the
waiver of any provision of, any "standstill" or similar agreement the effect
of which would be to permit such Person to effect a transaction without the
approval of Companys board of directors. Promptly (A) following the No-Shop
Period Start Date but subject to the rights of Company pursuant to _Section
5.2(c)_, Company will request each Person (other than any Excluded Party) and
(B) following the time when a previously Excluded Party ceases to constitute
an Excluded Party under the terms hereof, Company will request each such
previously Excluded Party and each Person who was a member of a group that
constituted an Excluded Party that has executed, within eighteen (18) months
prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal with,
or equity investment in, Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of any of Company or any Company Subsidiary and will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced any
obligation to do so. From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, subject to
the rights of Company pursuant to  _Section 5.2(c)_, Company shall
immediately cease and: (i) cause to be terminated any solicitation,
encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person (other than any
Excluded Party) conducted theretofore by Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; and (ii) cause to be terminated any access such Person (other than
any Excluded Party) may have to any physical or virtual data room maintained
by or on behalf of Company. From and after the time when a previously Excluded
Party ceases to constitute an Excluded Party under the terms hereof, subject
to the rights of Company pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)_, Company shall
immediately cease and: (i) cause to be terminated any solicitation,
encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person who was previously
an Excluded Party or a member of a group that constituted an Excluded Party
conducted theretofore by Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; and (ii)
cause to be terminated any access such Person may have to any physical or
virtual data room maintained by or on behalf of Company. Company shall not
take any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Affiliates or, subject to Companys compliance with _Section
5.2(e)_, any Excluded Party) from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provisions
of any other Takeover Statute) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply. 

   

 (i) Company shall not be entitled to effect a Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement under _Section 8.1(i)_ or _(j)_ , in each case with respect to a Superior Proposal, unless: (i) Company shall have provided a written notice (a _"Notice of Superior Proposal"_ ) to Parent that Company intends to take such action and included with such Notice of Superior Proposal all of the information regarding such Superior Proposal contemplated by  _Section 5.2(g)_; (ii) during the four (4) business day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letters so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (iii) following the end of the four (4) business day period, Companys board of directors or any 

  ##### 

  

    

properly constituted committee thereof shall have determined in good faith
after consultation with its Financial Advisor, taking into account any
changes to this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letters proposed in writing
by Parent in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that
the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment of any such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, and Company shall be required to
comply again with the requirements of this _Section 5.2(i)_; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that all references to four (4) business days above shall be
thereafter deemed to be references to two (2) business days. 

   

 (j) Company shall not be entitled to effect a Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening Event unless: (i) Company shall have provided a written notice (a _"Notice of Recommendation Change"_ ) to Parent that Company intends to take such action and included with such Notice of Recommendation Change a reasonably detailed description of the nature of such Intervening Event; (ii) during the four (4) business day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of Recommendation Change, Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letters so as to obviate the need for the Recommendation Change based on such Intervening Event; (iii) following the end of the four (4) business day period, Companys board of directors or any properly constituted committee thereof shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letters proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the failure to effect such Recommendation Change would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. 

   

 5.3 _Access to Information_. 

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, Company will afford to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to all of its (and the Company Subsidiaries) facilities, personnel, operations, books and records, will permit Parent and its Representatives to conduct inspections as they may reasonably request and will instruct the Companys Representatives to furnish Parent with such financial and operating data and other information (including then-current and projected cash and working capital balances) with respect to its business and properties as Parent may from time to time reasonably request, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 15, 2010, between Parent and Company (the _"Confidentiality Agreement"_ ); _provided_ , _however_ , that Company shall not be required to violate any obligation of confidentiality to which it is subject or to waive any privilege which it may possess in discharging its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that: (i) Company shall not be required to furnish or otherwise make available to Parent customer-specific data or competitively sensitive information relating to areas of Companys business in which Parent competes against Company; and (ii) subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, neither Parent nor any of its Representatives shall have any contact whatsoever with any partner, lender, lessor, vendor, customer, supplier, employee or consultant of Company with respect to any matters relating to Company or the Company Subsidiaries except in consultation with Company and upon receipt of the prior written consent of Company. Parent agrees that it will treat any such information confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality 

  ##### 

  

    

Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms, and will conduct any investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries and in a manner that complies with all
Applicable Laws. 

   

 (b) The parties acknowledge that both Company and Parent and its Affiliates currently are engaged in similar lines of business that from time to time compete with one another. In light of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the parties agree that neither this Agreement nor any provision by Company or any of its Representatives to Parent, its Affiliates or its Representatives of any information pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_ shall preclude or limit the right or ability of Parent and its Affiliates to: (i) develop or have developed for it products or services that compete with the products or services of Company or the Company Subsidiaries, provided such products or services were independently developed without use of the Companys information provided pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_; or (ii) respond to inquiries from, solicit business with or from, enter into business discussions with, offer to sell or sell products or services to (or, in the case of vendors, suppliers, prospective vendors or prospective suppliers, offer to buy or buy products or services from) or otherwise engage in business relations with any partners, customers, vendors, suppliers, or prospects of any nature whatsoever, whether or not partners, customers, customer prospects, vendors, suppliers or prospects of any party hereto or its respective Subsidiaries on or before the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, its Affiliates and its Representatives shall use the information obtained by any of them pursuant to _Section 5.3(a)_ solely in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 5.4 _Company Special Meeting; Board Recommendations_. 

  

 (a) After the date hereof, Company will take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to convene as promptly as practicable (and in any event, no later than thirty (30) days after the mailing of the Company Proxy Statement to Companys stockholders) a meeting of Companys stockholders (the _"Company Special Meeting"_ ) solely to consider the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Company, subject to _Section 5.2(e)_, will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and will take all other action necessary or advisable to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting with the consent of Parent (and shall so adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting up to one (1) time for a period not to exceed ten (10) business days if requested to do so by Parent) to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Company Proxy Statement (as determined by Company in good faith) is provided to Companys stockholders a reasonable time in advance of the Company Special Meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement thereof), or if as of the time for which the Company Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Company Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Special Meeting or to adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Company shall ensure that the Company Special Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies 

  ##### 

  

    

solicited by Company in connection with the Company Special Meeting are
solicited in compliance with Applicable Law and Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws. In furtherance of the foregoing, Company shall:
(i) establish a record date for purposes of determining stockholders entitled
to notice of and vote at the Company Special Meeting (the _"Record Date"_ )
consistent with Applicable Law and Companys bylaws and that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent; (ii) not change such Record Date or establish
a different record date for the Company Special Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), unless required to do so by Applicable Law or
Companys bylaws; (iii) in the event that the Company Special Meeting is for
any reason adjourned, postponed or otherwise delayed and unless Parent shall
have otherwise approved in writing (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), implement such adjournment, postponement
or other delay in such a way that Company does not establish a new Record
Date for the Company Special Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or
delayed, except as required by Applicable Law or Companys bylaws; (iv) keep
Parent reasonably informed prior to the date of the Company Special Meeting
as to the aggregate tally of the proxies received by Company with respect to
the Company Stockholder Approval; and (v) without the prior written consent
of Parent, not include any  proposal or matter (other than procedural
matters or other matters required by Applicable Law) to be acted on by
the stockholders of Company at the Company Special Meeting other than the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger. 

   

 (b) Except as permitted by _Section 5.2(e)_: (i) the board of directors of Company shall unanimously recommend that Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, at the Company Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) (the _"Company Board Recommendation"_ ); and (ii) the Company Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of Company has unanimously recommended that Companys stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, at the Company Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof). 

   

 5.5 _Company Proxy Statement; Related Matters_. After the execution of this Agreement, Company and Parent shall mutually prepare, and Company shall file with the SEC, the Company Proxy Statement (provided that each of Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Proxy Statement to be filed no later than three (3) business days following the No-Shop Period Start Date). Thereafter, Company shall mail to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than five (5) business days following the date upon which the SEC staff advises Company that it has no further comments on the Company Proxy Statement) the Company Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials for the Company Special Meeting. In connection with the foregoing, Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement. Subject to Applicable Law, prior to filing or mailing the Company Proxy Statement or filing any other required filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on each such filing or response and shall give 

   ##### 

  

    

reasonable and good faith consideration to all comments proposed to be
included in each such filing or response by Parent. Company and Parent shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC
with respect to all comments received on the Company Proxy Statement from the
SEC. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
all information in the Company Proxy Statement (and any amendment or
supplement thereto) other than information regarding Parent or Merger Sub
furnished to Company in writing by Parent specifically for use therein, at
the date the Company Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to Companys stockholders and at the time of the
Company Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof), does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that all information regarding Parent or Merger Sub furnished to Company in
writing by Parent specifically for use in the Company Proxy Statement (and
any amendment or supplement thereto), at the date the Company Proxy Statement
(and any amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to Companys
stockholders and at the time of the Company Special Meeting (or
any adjournment or postponement thereof), does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Each of Company and Parent shall promptly furnish to each other all
information, and take such other actions, as may reasonably be requested in
connection with any action by any of them in connection with the preceding
sentences of this _Section 5.5_. Whenever any party hereto learns of
the occurrence of any event or the existence of any fact which is required to
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement
pursuant to Applicable Law, such party shall promptly inform the other of
such occurrence and comply with all of its obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_ relating to effecting such amendment or supplement to the
Company Proxy Statement. 

  

 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

 (a) (i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, Company (and its respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, and all other Persons as may be required under Applicable Law, shall file with the Federal Trade Commission (the _"FTC"_ ) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the _"DOJ"_ ) all requisite documents and notifications relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as required by the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, together with all such other filings and submissions under Applicable Law, as the case may be, for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no later than five (5) business days following the date of this Agreement (unless Parent and Company mutually agree in writing to another date); and (ii) each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Company (and its respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations of all Government Authorities or other third parties that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no party is required to, and neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary may, without the prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates in any manner which, individually or in the aggregate with all other such requirements, conditions, understandings, agreements and Orders could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (including a reputational effect) on the business, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries or Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any material jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon the request of Parent, Company will, and will cause each Company Subsidiary to, become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of Company or any such Company Subsidiary, so long as such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order is binding on Company or such Company Subsidiary only in the event that the Closing occurs. 

   

 (d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Company (and its respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, shall keep the other party promptly informed of any material communication regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any filings, investigations with, by or before any Government Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or documentary material from any Government Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act or any other 

  ##### 

  

    

Applicable Laws with respect to which any such filings have been made, then
such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably
practicable and unless prohibited by Applicable Law or by the applicable
Government Authority, the parties hereto agree to: (i) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Government

provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: (i) all obligations of the parties hereto with respect to the Debt Financing or any other financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be governed exclusively by _Section 5.17_ and _Section 5.18_ and not this _Section 5.6_; and (ii) _Section 5.6(b)_ does not apply to any approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations, confirmations, filings, submissions, consents, etc. with respect to any Government Bid or Government Contract, notwithstanding that the counterparty to those contracts and/or bids may be a Government Authority, the intent being for those matters to be governed by _Section 5.6(a)_ above.

No disclosure after the date of this Agreement of the untruth of any representation and warranty made in this Agreement will operate as a cure of any breach of the failure to disclose the information, nor any untrue representation or warranty made herein. 

  

 5.9 _Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity agree to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director or officer of Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, a _"Company Indemnified Person"_ ) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Action arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or any Action instituted by any Company Indemnified Person to enforce this  _Section 5.9_ or any other indemnification or advancement right of such Company Indemnified Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted to indemnify such Company Indemnified Person under Applicable Law and its respective certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement (in each case, as applicable) in effect on the date of this Agreement (including the advancing of expenses to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Indemnified Person to whom such expenses are advanced shall be required to provide an undertaking to the Surviving Entity to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether any such Company Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under Applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement (in each case, as applicable) of Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to such Company Indemnified Person and the Surviving Entity. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to honor and fulfill all obligations of Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to any written indemnification agreements with Company Indemnified Persons identified on _Schedule 3.15_ to the Company Disclosure Statement.

If Parent or the Surviving Entity for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy or policies as of the Effective Time, then, with Companys prior agreement and consent, the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the directors and officers insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided in Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable directors and officers insurance for such six (6) year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under the Companys existing policy as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent or the Surviving Entity be required to expend in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the current aggregate annual premiums of the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by Company as of the date of this Agreement (which aggregate annual premiums Company represents and warrants to be as set forth on _Schedule 5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Statement) (the _"Company Maximum Premium"_ ). In the event any future annual premiums for the directors and officers liability insurance policy required by this _Section 5.9(c)_ exceed the Company Maximum Premium, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall maintain the most advantageous directors and officers liability insurance policy that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Company Maximum Premium. 

   

 (d) This _Section 5.9_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Persons, their heirs and personal representatives, shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their successors and assigns and may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Person (provided that such amendment, alteration or repeal prior to the Effective Time shall be governed by _Section 9.1_). In the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity (as the case may be) honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 5.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to cause any and all dispositions of Company Securities pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act in accordance with applicable interpretive and/or no-action guidance issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 5.11 _Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Laws and rules and policies of the Exchange to enable the delisting by the Surviving Entity of the Company Common Stock from the Exchange and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date. 

  

 5.12 _Resignation of Directors and Officers_.

 5.14 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

  

 (a) Other than with respect to employees who enter into separate employment agreements with Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Entity), Parent agrees to cause all employees of Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the _"Current Employees"_ ) to be (as of the Effective Time) eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries consistent with the eligibility criteria applied by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to other employees generally of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Current Employees will be provided with base salary, incentive bonus opportunities and benefits (including health and welfare benefits, severance, etc.) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided by Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time except with respect to such amounts or benefits that are not provided in compliance with the provisions of _Section 5.1_. In addition, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall honor, or cause to be honored, in accordance with their respective terms, all vested or accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, Current Employees, including any benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event). 

   

 (b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Current Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the _"New Parent Plans"_ ), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such New Parent Plan to: (i) waive all 

  ##### 

  

    

applicable pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Current
Employee; (ii) recognize the service of Current Employees accrued (or
otherwise credited by Company or the Company Subsidiaries) prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting
credit under (but not for the purposes of benefit accrual); and (iii) provide
credit for any co-payments, deductibles and out of pocket expenditures for
the remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage
occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any credit be given
to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same
period of service. 

   

 (c) No provision in this _Section 5.14_ will: (i) create or be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; (ii) constitute or create or be deemed to constitute or create an employment agreement or contract with any Person; (iii) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent, Company or any of their respective Affiliates; or (iv) limit Parents or the Surviving Entitys discretion and authority to interpret any of its respective employee benefit plans or other compensation plans, agreements, arrangements or programs, in each case in accordance with their respective terms and Applicable Law. 

   

 (d) Provided that Parent complies with its obligations pursuant to _Sections 5.14(a)_ and _5.14(b)_ , no provision in this _Section 5.14_ will: (i) prohibit Parent from adding, deleting or changing providers of benefits, changing, increasing or decreasing co-payments, deductibles or other requirements for coverage or benefits (e.g., utilization review or pre-certification requirements) and/or making other changes in the administration or in the design, coverage and benefits provided to such Current Employees; or (ii) limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any of its respective employee benefit plans or other compensation plans, agreements, arrangements or programs, in each case in accordance with their respective terms and Applicable Law. 

   

 5.15 _Takeover Statutes_. At all times prior to the Effective Time, Company and its board of directors shall: (i) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (ii) if any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 5.16 _Transaction Litigation_. Company will give Parent prompt written notice of, as well as an opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of, any stockholder litigation against Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Company agrees that it will not settle or offer to settle any such litigation relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent, provided that, after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, Company shall cooperate with Parent and, if requested by Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to settle any such unresolved transaction litigation in accordance with Parents direction, except that in no event shall Company be required to agree to any such 

   ##### 

  

    

settlement that would require Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
take or refrain from taking any action, or to pay any amount, prior to the
Closing. 

  

 5.17 _Financing Assistance_. Prior to the Closing, Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its Representatives, including, in each case, legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to, cooperate as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, the arrangement and syndication of the Debt Financing and the Debt Payoff, including: (i) assisting with the preparation of materials, and confirmation of the information provided therein, for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, bank syndication materials and similar documents required in connection with the preceding; (ii) causing Company and the Company Subsidiaries to execute and deliver customary guarantee, pledge and security documents and related solvency and officer certificates or other documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including certificates of the chief financial officer of Company and each Company Subsidiary with respect to customary matters for use in their reports in any materials relating to the preceding) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the guaranteeing of obligations and the pledging of collateral (provided that no obligations of Company or the Company Subsidiaries or its Representatives under any such agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be effective unless and until the Closing occurs); (iii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding Company and the Company Subsidiaries (including historical and pro forma financial statements and information, financial projections and prospects), including information required by regulatory authorities including under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations; (iv) permitting the prospective lenders involved in the financing activities to evaluate and appraise Companys and the Company Subsidiaries current assets and liabilities, cash management and accounting systems and policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements; (v) participating in meetings, drafting sessions, presentations, due diligence sessions and similar sessions, including with rating agencies and potential lenders as reasonably requested by Parent; (vi) establishing bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing that are effective after the Effective Time; (vii) entering into one or more credit or other agreements on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt Financing immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent direct borrowings or debt incurrences by Company or any Company Subsidiary are contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (provided that no obligations of Company or the Company Subsidiaries or its Representatives under any such agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be effective unless and until the Closing occurs); (viii) taking, or appointing a Parents Representative to take, all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing (including the syndication thereof) and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to Parent; (ix) requesting customary payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing to allow for the Debt Payoff; (x) assisting in obtaining public corporate credit ratings for the Debt Financing; (xi) assisting in obtaining consents, landlord waivers and estoppels, non-disturbance agreements, non-invasive environmental assessments, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance; (xii) furnishing the Debt Financing Sources promptly, and in any event at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, with all documentation and other information required by Government Authorities with respect to the Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act; (xiii) providing authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to 

   #####

Sources that the public side versions of such documents, if any, do not
include material non-public information about the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or securities; and (xiv) providing access to, and
requesting the cooperation of, trustees, agents and other relevant parties in
connection with any repayment of outstanding indebtedness of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries required to be completed prior to or promptly
following the Closing. The provisions of this _Section 5.17_ shall not
require the cooperation of Company or the Company Subsidiaries or its
Representatives to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither Company
nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment fee or
similar fee or to incur any liability with respect to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters prior to the Closing. Company
hereby consents to the use of its and the Company Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing (including the arrangement and syndication
thereof), provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage Company or any Company
Subsidiary or the reputation or goodwill of Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 5.3_ , Parent and
Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose confidential information
regarding Company and the Company Subsidiaries to potential sources of
capital, rating agencies, prospective lenders and investors and their
respective representatives in connection with the Debt Financing so long as
such Persons agree to be bound by customary confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to Company and of which Company shall be a
beneficiary. 

  

 5.18 _Maintenance of Financing Commitments_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to obtain the Debt Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to: (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions contained therein or on other terms not materially less favorable to Parent or otherwise acceptable to Parent; and (ii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements and in the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ that Parent shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the Debt Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of Company if such amendment, modifications or waivers would, or would reasonably be expected to, (w) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to consummate the Merger (taking into account for such purposes the other funds available to Parent and the cash and material cash equivalents of Company and the Company Subsidiaries), (x) impose new or additional conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (y) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (z) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent shall deliver to Company a copy of any proposed amendment, modification or waiver of any Debt Commitment Letter at least one (1) business day prior to the proposed execution of such proposed amendment, modification or waiver. 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy all conditions to the Debt Commitment Letters that are applicable to Parent or Merger Sub that are within their control and if all conditions to the Debt 

  ##### 

  

    

Commitment Letters have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Persons providing such Debt Financing to fund such Debt
Financing on the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing from alternative sources on terms substantially similar to those contained in the applicable Debt Commitment Letter, or on terms substantially similar to those then-prevailing in the applicable capital markets (so long as such terms are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger Sub as the terms set forth in the applicable Debt Commitment Letter), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (any commitment letter evidencing such alternative debt commitment also being referred to herein as a Debt Commitment Letter and any debt financing contemplated thereby being referred to herein as the Debt Financing). 

   

 (d) Parent shall keep Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating to the Debt Financing and will pay when due all fees due and payable under the Debt Commitment Letters. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 5.18_ shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to: (i) bring any enforcement action against any Specified Person to enforce its respective rights under the Debt Commitment Letters; (ii) pay any fees or interest in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise); or (iii) provide any equity "kickers" to prospective lenders beyond those contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Parent is able to obtain after the date hereof one or more financing letter(s) containing a substantially similar commitment for financing on terms which are more favorable than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, the foregoing provisions shall instead be deemed to relate to such financing letter(s) in lieu of the Debt Commitment Letters. 

   

 (g) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that obtaining the Debt Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to their obligations to close the Merger and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the Merger and their other obligations under this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt Financing or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in  _Article VI_ and _Section 7.2_. 

   

 5.19 _Conduct of Business of Parent and Merger Sub Pending the Merger_. Except as otherwise contemplated herein with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, it shall operate its respective business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 9.5 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or obligation hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign their respective rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent and/or to any parties providing the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms thereof (including for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of such Debt Financing) without the consent of Company, provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 9.7 _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failure to take such actions as are required by any party hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an aware of specific 

   ##### 

  

 

performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled, without
posting a bond or similar indemnity, to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any federal court located in the State of

Agreement (including the Debt Commitment Letters); (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court; and (iii) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a federal court
located in the State of Delaware or a state court located in the State of
Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to _Section 9.9_, each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause
of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against any Specified Person in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
Applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

 9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

of the parties hereto. In any event, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any
way be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity, illegality or
