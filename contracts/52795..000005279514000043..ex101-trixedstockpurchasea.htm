STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of August 8, 2014,
by and among Tri-NVS Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Seller"), Tri-Northern Acquisition Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), and Anixter Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer").
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set
forth in Article X below.

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company, which as of the date hereof consists of 1,000 shares of the Company's
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (collectively, the "Shares");

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell
to Buyer all of such Shares; and

WHEREAS, the respective boards of managers or directors or other governing
bodies, as applicable, of Seller, the Company and Buyer have approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties, conditions and agreements contained herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

1.01 Purchase and Sale of Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller will sell, assign,
transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and acquire from Seller,
all of the outstanding Shares, free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens
created by Buyer or at the direction of Buyer, in exchange for the payment of
the Estimated Purchase Price in cash to Seller. Payment for such Shares will
be made by wire transfer on the Closing Date of immediately available funds to
the Escrow and Paying Agent and the Escrow and Paying Agent will pay such cash
to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available to an account or accounts
designated by Seller. In addition, at the Closing, Buyer will make the
following payments:

(a) first, to each holder of Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
of the type described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the definition thereof
(which are identified on Schedule 2.02(f)(iii)), the amount specified in the
payoff letters delivered by the Company to Buyer;

(b) second, to the payees of the Seller Transaction Expenses, the amount of
the Seller Transaction Expenses in accordance with the final bills, schedule
and wire transfer instructions delivered by the Company to Buyer; and 

(c) third, to the Escrow and Paying Agent, the Escrow Amount to be held in
escrow in accordance with the terms of the Escrow and Paying Agent Agreement.

1.02 Calculation of Closing and Final Consideration.

(a)For purposes of this Agreement, the "Purchase Price" means an amount equal
to:

(i)$420,000,000 ("Base Purchase Price"),

(ii)plus the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount;

(iii)plus the total amount of Cash as of immediately prior to the Closing,

(iv)minus the outstanding amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries of the type described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the
definition thereof as of immediately prior to the Closing,

(v)minus the unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses,

(vi)plus the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the Net
Working Capital Target,

(vii)minus the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than
the Net Working Capital Target,

(viii)minus the Escrow Amount, and

(ix)minus Escheat Amount.

(b)At least four (4) days prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver
to Buyer a statement (the "Preliminary Closing Statement") setting forth (i)
its good faith estimates of Cash, Indebtedness, Seller Transaction Expenses
and Net Working Capital, based on the Company's books and records and other
information available, and (ii) on the basis of the foregoing, its good faith
estimate of the Purchase Price (the "Estimated Purchase Price"). Estimates of
Cash, Indebtedness, Seller Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital shall
be calculated in accordance with the definitions of the terms Cash,
Indebtedness, Seller Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital and the Agreed
Accounting Principles. Upon receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement,
Buyer shall have the opportunity to review the Preliminary Closing Statement
and to the extent Buyer has any good faith objections thereon, the parties
will negotiate such objections in good faith. If by two (2) days prior to the
Closing Date, the parties have not agreed on the Preliminary Closing Statement
and the estimate of Net Working Capital proposed by the Company exceeds the
Net Working Capital Target by $2,000,000 (the "NWC Threshold"), then the Net
Working Capital used in the Estimated Purchase Price shall be equal to the Net
Working Capital Target plus the NWC Threshold. Schedule 1.02(b) sets forth a
sample calculation of the Net Working Capital. 

(c)As promptly as possible, but in any event within 90 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller (i) an unaudited, consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing (which will have
been prepared with the assistance of Buyer's or the Company's accountants) and
(ii) Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price (together, the "Closing
Statement"). The Closing Statement will be prepared in a manner consistent
with the definitions of the terms Cash, Indebtedness, Seller Transaction
Expenses, Net Working Capital and the Agreed Accounting Principles. The
Closing Statement will entirely disregard (i) any and all effects on the
assets or liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby or of any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or any other transaction
entered into by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) any of the plans, transactions, or changes which
Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the
Closing with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or their business or
assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer
or any of its assets or liabilities.

(d)Each of Buyer and Seller will, and Buyer will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing to, (i) reasonably assist the other party and
the other party's representatives in the review of the Preliminary Closing
Statement or the Closing Statement and the related determinations of the
Estimated Purchase Price or the Purchase Price and any disputes related
thereto and provide the other party and the other party's representatives with
reasonable access during normal business hours to its books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting
data, facilities and employees for purposes of the other party's review of the
Preliminary Closing Statement or the Closing Statement and the related
determinations of the Estimated Purchase Price or the Purchase Price and any
disputes related thereto, and (ii) reasonably cooperate with the other party
and the other party's representatives in connection with such review or
determination, including providing all other information reasonably necessary
or useful in connection with the review of the Preliminary Closing Statement
or the Closing Statement and the related determinations of the Estimated
Purchase Price or the Purchase Price and any disputes related thereto as is
requested by the other party or the other party's representatives. If Seller
has any objections to the Closing Statement, Seller will deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "Objections Statement"),
which statement will identify in reasonable detail those items and amounts to
which Seller objects (the "Disputed Items"), and Buyer and Seller will attempt
to resolve and finally determine and agree upon the Disputed Items as promptly
as practicable. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 45
days after delivery of the Closing Statement, the Closing Statement as
prepared by Buyer will be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties
hereto. Seller and Buyer will negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed
Items and all such discussions related thereto will (unless otherwise agreed
by Buyer and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence
and any applicable similar state rule, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement to
Buyer, Seller and Buyer will submit any unresolved Disputed Items to Duff and
Phelps (the "Arbiter"). In the event the parties submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to the Arbiter, each party will submit a Closing Statement
(which in the case of each party may be a Closing Statement that, with respect
to the unresolved Disputed Items (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to any other items), is different than the Closing Statement initially
submitted to Seller, or the Objections Statement delivered to Buyer, as
applicable) together with 

such supporting documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Arbiter within
10 days after the date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted
to the Arbiter for resolution. Seller and Buyer will use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbiter to resolve such dispute
as soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on
which the Arbiter receives the Closing Statements prepared by Seller and
Buyer, or as soon thereafter as practicable. The Arbiter will make a written
determination of each Disputed Item within 30 days after being appointed or as
soon thereafter as practicable. In resolving any Disputed Item, the Arbiter
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. Seller and Buyer will use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbiter to notify them in writing
of its resolution of such dispute as soon as practicable. The determination of
the Arbiter with respect to each Disputed Item will be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto and shall be a final arbitral award that may
be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Each party will bear
its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute
by the Arbiter. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be paid by
the party whose positions generally did not prevail in the Arbiter's
resolution of the dispute, or if the Arbiter determines that neither party
could be fairly found to be the prevailing party, then such fees, costs and
expenses will be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer.

(e)If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.02(d)
(the "Final Purchase Price") is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then, within five (5) business days after the determination of Final Purchase
Price, Buyer will pay an amount equal to such excess to the Escrow and Paying
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and the Escrow and
Paying Agent will pay to Seller such excess by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

(f)If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then, within five (5) business days after the determination of Final Purchase
Price, Seller will pay an amount equal to such shortfall to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds.

(g)All payments required pursuant to Section 1.02(e) and Section 1.02(f) will
be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

1.03 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis
LLP, located at 300 North LaSalle St., Chicago, Illinois, on the second
business day following satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing set forth
in Article II or such other date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree. The
date of the Closing is herein referred to as the "Closing Date." The Closing
will be deemed to occur at the close of business on the Closing Date.

1.04 Withholding. Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Escrow and
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow and Paying Agent
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law; provided that Buyer shall provide prior
written notification at least three (3) days prior to making any payment to
the Seller of any amounts Buyer intends to withhold pursuant to this Section
1.04 and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller to
eliminate any such deductions or withholding. To the extent that amounts are
so 

withheld and timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

ARTICLE II

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS OF SELLER AND THE COMPANY

6.01 Conduct of the Business.

(a)From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, except as otherwise
provided for by this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedules) or
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
(i) conduct their respective businesses only in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with past practice and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) maintain and preserve intact their respective present lines of
business and goodwill associated therewith, (B) maintain their respective
rights and franchises and preserve satisfactory relationships with
Governmental Bodies and employees and material customers, suppliers,
distributors, contractors, creditors, licensors, licensees and others having
material business relationships with them (to the extent beneficial), (C) keep 

available the services of their present officers, employees and consultants
and (D) comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and the
requirements of all Material Contracts; provided, that the foregoing
notwithstanding, the Company and its Subsidiaries may use all available cash
to pay any Seller Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness prior to the Closing,
for distributions or dividends or for any other lawful purpose.

(b)From the date hereof until the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided
for by this Agreement or consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company will not, and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action which, if taken after the
date of the Latest Balance Sheet, would be required to be disclosed on
Schedule 4.06 pursuant to Section 4.06.

6.02 Access to Books and Records. From the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, the Company will
provide Buyer and its authorized representatives with reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Buyer reasonably requests with
due regard to minimizing disruption of the conduct of the Company and its
Subsidiaries' businesses, in order for Buyer to have the opportunity to make
such investigation as it shall reasonably desire to make of the affairs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.02, the Company and its Subsidiaries may withhold any document (or
portions thereof) or information (i) for which disclosure is prohibited by the
terms of an agreement with a third party (provided that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such
third party to such access or disclosure), (ii) that may constitute privileged
attorney-client communications or attorney work product and the transfer of
which, or the provision of access to which, as reasonably determined by the
Company's counsel, constitutes a waiver of any such privilege or (iii) if the
provision of access to such document (or portion thereof) or information, as
reasonably determined by the Company's counsel, would conflict with applicable
laws. Buyer will treat all information obtained from or on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise as confidential and proprietary
under the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined herein).

6.03 Regulatory Filings. The Company will make or cause to be made all filings
and submissions under any material laws or regulations applicable to the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein that are required as a condition to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and, in each case, include in each such
filing or submission a request for early termination or acceleration of any
applicable waiting or review periods, to the extent available under the
applicable laws or regulations. The Company and its Subsidiaries will
coordinate and cooperate with Buyer in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as Buyer may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing.

6.04 Conditions. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the conditions set forth in Section 2.02 to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible after the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article II (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing).

6.05 Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01, neither Seller 

nor the Company will take any action to encourage, initiate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, provide any information to, or enter into an
agreement with, any Person (other than Buyer and its authorized
representatives ("Buyer's Representatives")) concerning any purchase of the
Shares, any merger, sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, or similar transactions involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than assets sold in the ordinary course of business).

6.06 Affiliate Transactions. Immediately prior to the Closing, except (i) for
the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, (iii) as set forth on Schedule 6.06 or (iv) as otherwise agreed by

caused its Affiliates to terminate), at no cost and without liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, all Affiliate Transactions.

6.07 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations. Promptly
after the date of this Agreement, the Company and Buyer will confer and
reasonably cooperate to form a joint strategy in order for Buyer and Buyer's
Representatives to contact and communicate with the employees, customers,

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that no contact

unreasonably withheld).

ARTICLE VII

COVENANTS OF BUYER

7.01 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing, Buyer will cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide Seller and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours, to the personnel, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior
to or on the Closing Date for purposes of complying with any applicable Tax,
financial reporting or regulatory requirements or any other reasonable
business purpose, subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.01. Unless
otherwise consented to in writing by Seller, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, Buyer will not, and will not permit the Company or
its Subsidiaries to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books and
records of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any portions thereof, relating
to periods prior to the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior
notice to Seller and offering to surrender to Seller such books and records or
such portions thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 7.01, Buyer may withhold (and may cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to withhold) any document (or portions thereof) or information
(i) for which disclosure is prohibited by the terms of an agreement with a
third party (provided that Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure),
(ii) that may constitute privileged attorney-client communications or attorney
work product and the transfer of which, or the provision of access to which,
as reasonably determined by Buyer's counsel, constitutes a waiver of any such
privilege or (iii) if the provision of access to such document (or portion
thereof) or information, as reasonably determined by Buyer's counsel, would
conflict with applicable laws. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
7.01, while the existence of an adversarial proceeding between the parties 

will not abrogate or suspend the provisions of this Section 7.01, as to such
records or other information directly pertinent to such dispute, the parties
may not utilize this Section 7.01 but rather, absent agreement, must utilize
the rules of discovery.

7.02 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.

(a)For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer will not, and will
not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify
any provision in the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent governing documents relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any current and
former officers or directors and/or direct or indirect stockholders (each, an
"DandO Indemnified Person") (unless required by law), it being the intent of the
parties that the officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses to the full extent of the law.

(b)Prior to the Closing, the Company will, at the Company's expense, obtain,
maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the
DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's and its Subsidiaries' current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' liability insurance in an amount
and scope at least as favorable as the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Closing Date. Buyer will not, or will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to not, cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect.

(c)In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of
transactions, then Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, in each such
case, ensure that the successors and assigns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.02. The provisions of this Section 7.02(e) will apply to all of the
successors and assigns of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

7.03 Regulatory Filings.

(a)Buyer will, within six (6) business days after the date hereof, make or
cause to be made all appropriate filings and submissions under the HSR Act and
any Other Antitrust Regulations applicable to Buyer and its Affiliates for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein that are required as a
condition to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and, in each
case, include in each such filing or submission a request for early
termination or acceleration of any applicable waiting or review periods, to
the extent available under the applicable laws or regulations. Subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company will have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable will consult
with Buyer on, all the information that appears in any such filings. In
exercising the foregoing right, the Company will act reasonably and as
promptly as possible. Buyer will pay all fees associated with all filings and
submissions referred to in this Section 7.03(a); provided that 50% of such
fees will be treated as Seller Transaction Expenses and provided further, that
the Company will reimburse to Buyer 50% of such fees if this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 8.01. 

(b)Buyer will use its commercially reasonably efforts to comply with any
additional requests for information, including requests for production of
documents and production of witnesses for interviews or depositions by any
Governmental Body. Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonably efforts to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Body or any other Person so as to enable the
parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, at the request of the Company, contesting, administratively or in
court, any ruling, order, or other action of any Governmental Body or any
other Person respecting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that Buyer shall not be required to consent to any divestiture or
other structural relief in order to obtain clearance from any Governmental
Body.

(c)Buyer will keep the Company apprised of the status of all filings and
submissions referred to in Section 7.03(a) above, including promptly
furnishing the Company with copies of notices or other communications received
by Buyer in connection therewith. Buyer will not permit any of its officers,
employees or other representatives or agents to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Body in respect of such filings and submissions unless
it consults with the Company in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Body, gives the Company the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat.

7.04 Conditions. Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 2.03 to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible after the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article II (other than those to be
satisfied at the Closing).

7.05 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations. Promptly
after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and the Company will confer and
reasonably cooperate to form a joint strategy in order for Buyer and Buyer's
Representatives to contact and communicate with the employees, customers,
suppliers and other business relations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that no contact
will be made by Buyer without prior consent of the Company (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a)by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

(b)by Buyer, if there has been a material violation or breach by the Company
or Seller of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement which has prevented or would prevent the satisfaction of any
condition to the obligations of Buyer at the Closing and such violation or
breach has not been waived by Buyer or, in the case of a covenant or agreement
breach, cured by the Company or Seller by the earlier of (i) the date that is
ten (10) days after written notice thereof from Buyer and (ii) the Outside
Date; 

(c)by Seller, if there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which has prevented or would prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of the Company and Seller at the Closing and such violation or
breach has not been waived by Seller or, in the case of a covenant or
agreement breach, cured by Buyer by the earlier of (i) the date that is ten
(10) days after written notice thereof from Seller and (ii) the Outside Date
(provided that neither a breach by Buyer of Section 5.08 nor the failure to
deliver the full consideration payable pursuant to Article I under this
Agreement at the Closing as required hereunder will be subject to cure
hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller); or

(d)by either Buyer or Seller if the transactions contemplated hereby have not
been consummated by 5:00 p.m., New York City time on November 15, 2014 (the
"Outside Date"); provided, that neither Buyer nor Seller will be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if such Person's
knowing or willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.02 Effect of Termination.

(a)In the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or Seller
as provided above, the provisions of this Agreement will immediately become
void and of no further force or effect (other than this Section 8.02 and
Article XI hereof which will survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their terms); provided, however, that the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated May 12, 2014, between Anixter International Inc. and Tri-
Northern Acquisition, Inc. (the "Confidentiality Agreement") will survive the
termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years following the date
of such termination (and notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the Confidentiality
Agreement term will be automatically amended to be extended for such
additional two-year period), and there will be no liability on the part of any
of the parties to one another, except for fraud or any knowing or willful
breaches of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
(including, the failure of a party to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement following the satisfaction of all the conditions to such
party's obligations under Article II other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and are capable of being satisfied
at the Closing) prior to the time of such termination. A breach by Buyer of
Section 5.08 hereof or the failure to deliver the full consideration payable
pursuant to Article I under this Agreement at the Closing will be considered a
willful breach of this Agreement prior to the termination of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Article VIII will be deemed to impair the right of any party
to compel specific performance by another party of its obligations under this
Agreement. Any claim which the Company or Seller may have in connection with a
termination of this Agreement will be enforceable by either of the Company and
Seller for the benefit of all such Persons.

ARTICLE IX

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGGREMENTS

9.01 Survival. The representations and warranties contained in Article III,
Article IV and Article V will survive the Closing and will terminate and be of
no further force and effect on the

Date will survive in accordance with the terms thereof. Buyer's right to be
indemnified for the matters set forth in (i) Section 9.02(a)(iii) shall
survive until the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) Section
9.02(a)(iv) shall survive until the date that is thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. No claim for
indemnification hereunder for breach of any such representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements may be made after the expiration of such applicable
survival period.

(a)From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article IX), Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents (the "Buyer Indemnitees") against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages or expenses (including costs of investigation and defense and
reasonable legal fees and reasonable fees and expenses of experts and other
professionals) (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses")
suffered or incurred by any such Buyer Indemnitee to the extent arising or
resulting from or in connection with (i) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller or the Company contained in Article III
or Article IV of this Agreement (without giving effect to any "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifier contained therein), (ii) any
breach of any post-Closing covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement, (iii) payments by, or on behalf of the Buyer, of Indebtedness or
Seller Transaction Expenses in excess of the amounts used in the calculation
of the Final Purchase Price, but only to the extent Buyer shall not have
recovered for such payments pursuant to Section 1.02(f), and (iv) Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (provided,
however, (1) that solely in the case of any Taxes payable in connection with
Tax Returns filed pursuant to Section 9.10(a)(i), any such Taxes shall be
determined after reduction for any Transaction Tax Deductions and (2) Seller
shall only be liable under this Section 9.02(a)(iv) to the extent that such
Taxes exceed the amount included as a Tax liability in the final calculation
of Net Working Capital).

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, even
if a Buyer Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to recover a Loss pursuant
to this Agreement:

(i)no Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification for a Loss
hereunder if, with respect to any individual item of Loss, such item is less
than $25,000 ("Minor Claim");

(ii)no Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification for a Loss
under Section 9.02(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses (excluding
Minor 

Claims) which the Buyer Indemnitees would otherwise recover under Section
9.02(a)(i) exceed, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $2,100,000 (the
"Deductible"), and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible;
provided, however, the Deductible will not apply to, and the Buyer Indemnitees
shall be entitled to indemnification without regard to the satisfaction of,
the Deductible with respect to claims for any breach of the representations
and warranties contained in Section 4.08 (Tax Matters) and for any breach of
any Fundamental Representation;

(iii)the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
9.02(a)(i) (other than any indemnification obligation from any breach of any
Fundamental Representation) or Section 9.02(a)(iv) an amount in excess of
$10,500,000 (the "General Cap") in the aggregate under both Section 9.02(a)(i)
and Section 9.02(a)(iv); provided that, in the event that Buyer Indemnitees
have recovered an amount equal the General Cap, Buyer Indemnitees will be
entitled to recover up to an additional $5,000,000 in the aggregate under (A)
Section 9.02(a)(i) resulting from a breach of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.08 (Taxes) and (B) Section 9.02(a)(iv) in
the aggregate under both Section 9.02(a)(i) and Section 9.02(a)(iv);

(iv)the Buyer Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section 9.02
in excess of the amount of the Purchase Price paid to Seller.

(c)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller will have no obligation to indemnify any of the Buyer Indemnitees from
and against any Taxes of any Person (i) for any Post-Closing Tax Period as a
result of any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.08 (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.08(h)) and Section 4.12, or as a result of any reduction or other
diminution in net operating loss carryforwards, net capital loss
carryforwards, or Tax credits of the Company and its Subsidiaries attributable
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) any transaction occurring on the Closing Date
but after the Closing outside the ordinary course of business, (iii)
attributable to the manner in which Buyer finances the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, or (iv) that arise directly as a result of
(A) Buyer\'s amendment of any Tax Return that relates in whole or in part to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (B) Buyer making of any Tax election that has
retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(d)All payments under this Section 9.02 will be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by Seller pursuant to Article I. The
parties agree that the Escrow Account will be treated as a contingent
installment obligation for United States federal and all applicable United
States state and local income Tax purposes, and that Buyer will be obligated
to report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow
Account as income of Buyer in the taxable year or years in which such income
is properly includible, and will be obligated to pay any Taxes attributable
thereto. Each of the parties will file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the foregoing.

(e)Prior to attempting to recover from Seller for any indemnifiable Losses
under this Section 9.02 or enforcing the Limited Guaranty thereof, the Buyer
Indemnities shall first attempt to recover for any such Losses from the Escrow
Funds. 

9.03 Indemnification for the Benefit of the Seller Indemnitees.

(a)From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this Article
IX), Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its members, its and their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents (the "Seller Indemnitees") against from any Losses suffered or incurred
by any such Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising or resulting from or in
connection with (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer set forth in Article V of this Agreement (without giving
effect to any "materiality" or similar qualifier) and (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Buyer or the Company (with respect to the Company,
requiring performance after the Closing) contained in this Agreement. All
payments under this Section 9.03 will be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by Seller pursuant to Article I.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, even
if a Seller Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to recover a Loss pursuant
to this Agreement:

(i)no Seller Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification for a Loss
under Section 9.03(a)(i) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses which the
Seller Indemnitees would otherwise recover under Section 9.03(a)(i) exceed, on
a cumulative basis, an amount equal to the Deductible, and then only to the
extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; provided, however, the Deductible
will not apply to, and the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification without regard to the satisfaction of, the Deductible with
respect to claims for any breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation;

(ii)the Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section
9.03(a)(i) (other than any indemnification obligation under Section 9.03(a)(i)
resulting from a breach of any Buyer Fundamental Representation) an aggregate
amount in excess of the General Cap; and

(iii)the Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover under Section 9.03
in excess of the amount of the Purchase Price paid to Seller.

9.04 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement will terminate on the applicable survival termination
date (as set forth in Section 9.01), unless, with respect to a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that terminates following the Closing Date, an
Indemnified Party has made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 prior to such termination date, as applicable,
including by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the
amount of the Losses (if known and quantifiable) and details of and the method
of computation thereof, the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any
such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon
which such claim for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party. If an
Indemnified Party has made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Article IX prior to such termination date, then such claim will not be
extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set forth in Section 9.01. 

9.05 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a)In order for a party (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party
Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis will not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party will have been actually
and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable
time after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the Third-Party Claim.

(b)Except with respect to Third-Party Claims by a Taxing Authority in respect
of Taxes (which shall be governed by Section 9.10(c)), any Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in the defense of a Third-Party Claim at such
Indemnifying Party's expense, and at its option, by notice to the Indemnified
Party delivered within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of notice of such
Third-Party Claim, will be entitled to assume the defense thereof (at the
expense of such Indemnifying Party) by appointing its own counsel (which
counsel must be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) in
connection with such defense, which notice shall state that, assuming the
facts then presented to the Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party are
true, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for the
Losses (subject to all of the limitations set forth in this Article IX) the
Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in
the nature of, or caused by the Third-Party Claim to the extent provided in
this Article IX; provided, however, that unless otherwise consented by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party may not assume and conduct the
defense of such Third-Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; provided,
further, that any Indemnifying Party will continue to be entitled to assert
any limitation on any Third-Party Claims contained herein; and provided,
further, that the Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose as counsel of record, if applicable (and the parties shall jointly
control the defense), and the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will
be borne solely by the Indemnifying Party if (i) there exists any actual or
potential conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim
that would make representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Party inappropriate, (ii) such Third-Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (iii) such
Third-Party Claim is related to or otherwise arises in connection with any
criminal or regulatory enforcement action or (iv) the Indemnifying Party has
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third-Party Claim
or shall have failed to engaged counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of notice of such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party controls the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim then the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to settle such
Third-Party Claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party will obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any
settlement of a Third-Party Claim, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, (x) injunctive or other equitable 

relief will be imposed against the Indemnified Party, (y) such settlement does
not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-Party Claim, without
prejudice or (z) such settlement involves a finding or admission or any
wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim, all the parties will reasonably
cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim. Such
cooperation will include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's
reasonable request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making employees and other representatives and advisors available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any information provided hereunder. Whether or not Seller will have assumed
the defense of a Third-Party Claim hereunder, no Buyer Indemnitee will admit
any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-
Party Claim hereunder without the prior written consent of Seller (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Seller
will act on behalf of all Indemnifying Parties in the case of all Third-Party
Claims with respect to which Buyer is seeking indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.02. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses
of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim.

9.06 Additional Indemnification Provisions. In the event that an Indemnifying
Party makes any payment to any Indemnified Party for indemnification for which
such Indemnified Party could have collected on a claim against a third party
(including under any contract and any insurance claims), the Indemnifying
Party will be entitled to pursue claims and conduct litigation on behalf of
such Indemnified Party and any of its successors, to pursue and collect on any
indemnification or other remedy available to such Indemnified Party thereunder
with respect to such claim and generally to be subrogated to the rights of
such Indemnified Party. Except pursuant to a written settlement agreed to by
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will not waive or release any
contractual right to recover from a third party any Loss subject to
indemnification hereby without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnified Party will, and will cause its Affiliates (including
the Company if the Company is an Affiliate) to, reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, with respect to any
such effort to pursue and collect with respect thereto.

9.07 Determination of Loss Amount.

(a)The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under Section 9.02 and
Section 9.03 will be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefits actually realized
by any party seeking indemnification hereunder arising from the deductibility
of such Losses in the Tax year in which such Losses are incurred or in the
immediately succeeding Tax year and (ii) any amounts recovered (less
reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses actually incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with such recovery) by any Indemnified Party
or any of such Indemnified Party's Affiliates under or pursuant to any
insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement
or contract pursuant to or under which such Indemnified Party or such
Indemnified Party's Affiliates is a party or has rights (collectively,
"Alternative Arrangements"). For purposes hereof, the Indemnified Party shall
be deemed to recognize a tax benefit ("Tax Benefit") with respect to a taxable
year if, and to the extent that, the Indemnified Party's cumulative liability
for Taxes 

through the end of such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items
attributable to the Losses from all taxable years, exceeds the Indemnified
Party's actual, cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable
year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items attributable to the
Losses for all taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and
treating such Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year). The
Indemnified Party will seek full recovery under all Alternative Arrangements
covering any Loss to the same extent as such Indemnified Party would if such
Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that a
recovery is made under an Alternative Arrangement by any Indemnified Party
and/or the Indemnified Party recognizes a Tax Benefit, in each case, with
respect to any Loss for which such Indemnified Party has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (less
reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses actually incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with such recovery) will be made promptly to
the Indemnifying Party.

(b)In no event will an Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make a
claim for punitive damages, except to the extent awarded against an
Indemnified Party in connection with a Third-Party Claim. Attorney,
consultant, and other professional fees and disbursements incurred by an
Indemnified Party in connection with this Article IX will be reasonable and
based only on time actually spent, which will be charged at no more than such
professional's standard hourly rate.

(c)For the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer Indemnitee will be entitled to any
duplication of recoveries under this Agreement.

9.08 Exclusive Remedy.

(a)Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, except in the case of fraud,
from and after the Closing, Section 9.02 and Section 9.03 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of Buyer and Seller, respectively, with respect to any
and all claims relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal
theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise.

(b)The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement relating to
indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyer's remedies with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including Section
9.02 and Section 9.03) were specifically bargained for between sophisticated
parties and were specifically taken into account in the determination of the
amounts to be paid to Seller hereunder.

9.09 Financing. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and their respective
representatives to, on a timely basis, provide all reasonable cooperation
requested by Buyer and/or any lender which has committed to provide Buyer with
any portion of Buyer's financing that is used to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that is reasonably necessary and customary to
assist Buyer in connection with such financing, but excluding the production
of new financial statements relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
causing its certified independent auditors to provide auditors' reports and
customary comfort letters with respect to financial information relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the 

ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided further that
the Company and its Subsidiaries will not be required to produce and deliver
any financial statements or other financial information not currently in
possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

9.10 Tax Matters.

(a)Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.

(i)Buyer will prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to be
timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that have
not been filed as of the Closing Date. Buyer will timely pay, or cause to be
timely paid, any amount shown as due on any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period and be reimbursed for such payment by Seller, in accordance
with Section 9.02(e), to the extent Seller has an obligation to indemnify
Buyer for such Taxes under Section 9.02(a). Tax Returns with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past
custom and practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as otherwise
required by applicable law. At least thirty (30) days prior to the date on
which each Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period is due, Buyer
will submit such Tax Return to Seller to provide Seller with an opportunity to
review, reasonably comment and consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) on such Tax Return with ten (10) days of
Seller's receipt of such Tax Return. Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold
incorporation of Seller's comments. The Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith with respect to any disputed item in any Tax Return prepared under
this Section 9.10(a)(i). If the disputed item is not resolved within five (5)
days, then Buyer and Seller shall jointly engage a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the
"Accountant") to resolve the disputed items, within a reasonable time, taking
into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return. If any dispute with
respect to any such Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such
Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which Seller deems
correct. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be
adjusted (or amended, if necessary) to reflect such resolution and shall be
binding upon the parties without further adjustment. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Accountant shall be borne by Buyer and Seller under the same
methodology used in Section 1.02.

(ii)For the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing, other than the
transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Buyer will cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to carry on their business only in the ordinary course in the
same manner as heretofore conducted. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, the Company and its Subsidiaries will elect with the relevant Taxing
Authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(iii)With respect to the preparation of Tax Returns pursuant to Section
9.10(a)(i), Buyer and Seller agree that, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, all Transaction Tax Deductions will be treated as properly
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and claimed as deductions in the Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
that ends on the Closing Date. 

(b)Tax Contests. The Buyer shall notify the Seller within ten (10) days of
receiving written notice of any Tax Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Seller shall have the right to control the handling, disposition, and
settlement of any such Tax Contest. If Seller elects to control a Tax Contest,
(1) Buyer shall have the right to participate at its own expense in any such
Tax Contest, and (2) Seller shall not, without Buyer\'s consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, agree to any
settlement with respect to such Tax Contest. Buyer shall control the handling,
disposition, and settlement of any Tax Contest the Seller elects not to
control, provided that (1) Seller shall have the right to participate at its
own expense in any such Tax Contest, and (2) Buyer shall not, without
Seller\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed, agree to any settlement with respect to such Tax
Contest. The Seller shall promptly notify the Buyer if it decides to control
the defense or settlement of any Tax Contest that it is entitled to control
pursuant to this Agreement.

(c)Books and Records; Cooperation. Without limiting Section 9.11, Buyer will,
and will cause its representatives to retain and provide Seller and its
representatives with reasonable access to all records or information that may
be relevant to its review of any pre-Closing Tax Return or any audit,
examination or proceeding by any Taxing Authority or judicial or
administrative proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that may result in an indemnification obligation pursuant
to Section 9.02.

(d)Transfer Taxes. Buyer will pay, and will indemnify and hold Seller harmless
against, any real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer
tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Company, its Subsidiaries or Seller
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties, interest or additions to Tax with
respect to the Transfer Taxes. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in the
filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly
supplying any information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to
complete such returns.

(e)Tax Elections. Buyer will not make any election under Code Section 338 or
Section 336 (or any similar provisions under state, local, or foreign law)
with respect to the acquisition of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant
to this Agreement.

(f)Amended Tax Returns; Tax Elections.

(i)From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, except to the extent
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company and its Subsidiaries will not
make or change any material election in respect of Taxes, adopt or change any
accounting method in respect of Taxes, file or amend any material Tax Return,
enter into any closing agreement, settle any claim or assessment in respect of
Taxes, or consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period
applicable to any claim or assessment in respect of Taxes.

(ii)Buyer will not, without Seller's prior written consent (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) voluntarily approach any Tax
authority with respect to any 

Pre-Closing Tax Period or Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
(ii) extend the statute of limitations with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

(g)Tax Refunds. Except to the extent reflected as an asset in the final
calculation of Net Working Capital and except to the extent resulting from a
Transaction Tax Deduction, Seller will be entitled to any Tax refunds or
credits claimed in lieu of a refund that are received by Buyer, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries becomes entitled in any Post-Closing
Tax Period, that relate to any Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer will pay over to Seller any such refund or
the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) business days after actual
receipt of such refund or credit against Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Purchase Price include payment for the Transaction Tax Benefit and no
other payment shall be due to Seller in connection with any Transaction Tax
Deduction.

(h)Straddle Period Allocation. To the extent it is necessary for purposes of
this Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes among a Straddle Period,
(i) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, payroll,
sale, or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible
or intangible) of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date and (ii) the amount of other Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in such Straddle
Period.

(i)Non-Avoidance. Buyer will not take any action with respect to the the
Company or its Subsidiaries that would cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or
substantially similar to, the "Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described
in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

9.11 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any party
hereto and at such requesting party's expense, any other party will execute

instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary to evidence and
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

any such key employees to execute such non-compete agreements.

of Seller such unitholder's portion of the Purchase Price unless and until
such unitholder has duly executed and delivered a counterpart signature to the
Limited Guaranty to each of Seller, Buyer and the Company. If a unitholder of
Seller has not so executed and delivered such counterpart signature, then
Seller will retain the funds that such unitholder executes a Limited Guaranty
or Seller no longer has any obligation to retain such funds under this
Agreement or no longer has any indemnification obligations hereunder.

9.14 Termination of Employment Arrangements. Seller shall be responsible for
any and all costs associated with the termination of the employment
arrangements of the individuals listed on Schedule 9.14 and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees for any such costs or any claims made

11.05 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by any party hereto without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto; provided that Buyer may, upon written notice to
Seller, assign all or part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
to an Affiliate, but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations
under this Agreement.

11.06 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision will 

be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and the parties will amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any prohibited or invalid provision with an effective and valid
provision that gives effect to the intent of the parties to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law.

11.07 No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person.
The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separately numbered sections corresponding to sections of this Agreement;
provided however, each section of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to
incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedules to which the applicability of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and
not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this
Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are
not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside
of the ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact of the
setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any Disclosure Schedule or
Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or
outside of the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by
any party hereto to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any
violation of law or breach of contract).

11.08 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company and Seller; provided
that (a) Section 7.02 will not be amended or waived without the consent of a
majority of the DandO Indemnified Persons and (b) Section 11.01 will not be
amended or waived without the consent of Audax. No waiver of any provision
hereunder or any breach or default thereof will extend to or affect in any way
any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

11.09 Complete Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement by,
between and among the parties and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by, between or among the parties, written or
oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. The
parties agree that prior drafts of this Agreement and of any provision herein
will be deemed to not provide any evidence as to the meaning of any provision
hereof or the intent of the parties with respect hereto and that such drafts
will be deemed joint work product of the parties. The parties hereto have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
respecting the sale 

and purchase of the Company pursuant to the express terms and provisions of
this Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that this
Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties
derived from arm's-length negotiations; all parties to this Agreement
specifically acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with
another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length transaction.

11.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic transmission
in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not contain the
signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together
will constitute one and the same instrument.

11.11 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and performed
entirely within such State.

11.12 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS. SUBJECT TO SECTION 1.02
(WHICH WILL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE ARISING THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE COURTS LOCATED IN
WILMINGTON, DELAWARE OR THE COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES LOCATED IN WILMINGTON,
DELAWARE IN RESPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND
ENFORCEABILITY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT, AND AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, ANY DEFENSE IN ANY SUCH ACTION FOR THE
INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION MAY
NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SUCH COURTS OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS OR THAT THEIR
PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM EXECUTION, THAT THE ACTION IS BROUGHT IN AN

PROCESS WITH RESPECT THERETO MAY BE MADE UPON BUYER BY MAILING A COPY THEREOF
BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS

THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF 

OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 11.13.

11.14 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for Sections 7.02, 9.02, 9.03 and
11.01, which are intended to benefit, and be enforceable by, the parties
specified therein, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be
construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

11.15 Representation of Seller and its Affiliates. Buyer agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees, that, following the Closing,
Kirkland and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to Seller and its Affiliates in
connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement notwithstanding any representation by Kirkland and Ellis LLP prior to
the Closing date of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries. Buyer and the
Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) hereby (i) waive any claim
they have or may have that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has a conflict of interest or
is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (ii) agree
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and Seller or any of its Affiliates,
Kirkland and Ellis LLP may represent the Seller or any of its Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to
Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries and even though Kirkland and Ellis LLP
may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Buyer represents that Buyer's own attorney has
explained and helped Buyer evaluate the implications and risks of waiving the
right to assert a future conflict against Kirkland and Ellis LLP, and Buyer's
consent with respect to this waiver is fully informed. Buyer and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) also further agree that, as to all
communications among Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the Company, its Subsidiaries,
and Seller or Seller's Affiliates and representatives, that relate in any way
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may
be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, if the Closing occurs, all of
the client files and records in the possession of Kirkland and Ellis LLP related
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will continue to be
property of (and be controlled by) Seller and none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries will retain any copies of such records or have any access to
them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party other
than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries may assert the attorney client privilege to prevent 

disclosure of confidential communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to such
third party; provided, however, that neither the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
Seller.

11.16 No Additional Representations; Disclaimer; Non-Recourse.

(a)Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted an independent investigation and
verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and, in making its determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely on the
results of its own independent investigation and verification and the
representations and warranties of Seller and the Company expressly and
specifically set forth in Article III and Article IV of this Agreement,
respectively, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules. The representations
and warranties of Seller and the Company expressly and specifically set forth
in Article III and Article IV of this Agreement, as qualified by the
Disclosure Schedules, constitute the sole and exclusive representations,
warranties, and statements of any kind of any of Seller and the Company to
Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer
understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other representations,
warranties, and statements of any kind or nature expressed or implied
(including any relating to the future or historical financial condition,
results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or condition of the Company's or
its Subsidiaries' assets) are specifically disclaimed by the Company and
Seller, including as set forth on Schedule 11.16. No Person is asserting the
truth of any representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement; rather
the parties have agreed that should any representations and warranties of any
party prove untrue, the other party will have the specific rights and remedies
herein specified as the exclusive remedy therefor, but that no other rights,
remedies or causes of action (whether in law or in equity or whether in
contract or in tort) are permitted to any party hereto as a result of the
untruth of any such representation and warranty. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND THE COMPANY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR SELLER MAKES OR PROVIDES, AND BUYER HEREBY
WAIVES, ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE QUALITY,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, OR
CONDITION OF THE COMPANY'S OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES' ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF.
BUYER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND THE COMPANY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE
III AND ARTICLE IV, RESPECTIVELY, (X) BUYER IS ACQUIRING THE COMPANY ON AN "AS
IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND (Y) NONE OF THE COMPANY, SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON
(INCLUDING, ANY STOCKHOLDER, MEMBER, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF
ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE OR ANY OTHER
CAPACITY) IS MAKING, AND BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON, ANY REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES, OR OTHER STATEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY MATTER
CONCERNING THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY 

INFORMATION PROVIDED TO (OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED BY) BUYER OR ANY OF BUYER'S
REPRESENTATIVES.

(b)Other than as provided in the Limited Guaranty, this Agreement may only be
enforced against, and any claim or suit based upon, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be brought against the named parties to this Agreement and
then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with
respect to the named parties to this Agreement. No Person who is not a named
party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of the Company, Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates, will have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation (whether in contract or in tort) to Buyer or any
other Person resulting from (nor will Buyer have any claim with respect to)
(i) the distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's use of, or reliance on, any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Buyer in certain "data rooms," confidential information memoranda
or management presentations in expectation of, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the sale and purchase of the Company, including
any alleged non-disclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Persons, in
each case, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise; and each party hereto waives and
releases all such liabilities and obligations against any such Persons.

(c)In connection with the investigation by Buyer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer has received or may receive from the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries certain projections, forward-looking statements and other
forecasts and certain business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties,
that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that Buyer
will have no claim against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer
acknowledges that neither the Company, Seller, nor any member, officer,
director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing, whether in an individual,
corporate or any other capacity, make any representation, warranty, or other
statement with respect to, and Buyer is not relying on, such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and
Buyer agrees that it has not relied thereon.

11.17 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. Except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that to the extent
any terms and provisions of this Agreement are in any way inconsistent with or
in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any other agreement,
document or instrument contemplated hereby, this Agreement will govern and
control.

11.18 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate 

remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and
hereby agree that each party shall be entitled to specifically enforce the
terms and provision of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the other parties under this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at law or in equity, including such party's right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and to seek money
damages. Each party hereto agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement. Each party hereto
waives (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under
any law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

11.19 Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be treated
in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto
will re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties.
No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such
party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense
related to lack of authenticity.

11.20 Buyer Deliveries. Any document or item will be deemed "delivered",
"provided" or "made available" within the meaning of this Agreement if such
document or item (i) is included in the electronic data room, (ii) actually
delivered or provided to the Buyer or any of Buyer's Representatives or (iii)
made available upon request, including at the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' offices.
