 4. _Adjustment of Closing Cash Consideration_.
         

 1. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, the Shareholders\' Representative shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") that shall fairly and accurately present the Working Capital of the Company as of 5 p.m., Central Time, on the Closing Date (" _Closing Working Capital_ ") and a certificate based on such Closing Statement setting forth the Shareholders\' Representative\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital (" _Representative\'s Calculation_ "). For illustrative purposes only, attached hereto as _Schedule 2.4_ is a schedule showing a calculation of Working Capital as of September 30, 2004. The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as it is correctly applied by the Company in all respects as of the Effective Time, and, to the extent in accordance with GAAP, shall utilize the Company\'s accounting policies and procedures that are in effect at the Effective Time, as utilized in preparing the Company\'s audited financial statements, including, without limitation, its revenue recognition policies to the extent such policies and procedures are in accordance with GAAP as correctly applied by the Company as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Accounting Policies_ ").
   

 2. If Parent disagrees with Representative\'s Calculation, Parent may, within fifteen (15) business days after its receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to the Shareholders\' Representative disputing Representative\'s Calculation and setting forth Parent\'s calculation of Closing Working Capital (" _Parent\'s Calculation_ "). Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Parent disagrees with the Closing Statement, along with a brief description of Parent\'s reasons for disagreeing with such item or amount, and Parent shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and Representative\'s Calculation. In analyzing the Closing Statement and the Representative\'s Calculation, Parent shall apply the Company Accounting Policies as in effect at the Effective Time. For greater certainty, the Company Accounting Policies as in effect at the Effective Time shall be utilized notwithstanding that Parent may utilize other accounting policies and procedures in preparing Parent\'s audited financial statements, or may have changed the Company\'s accounting policies and procedures following Closing to conform to Parent\'s accounting policies and procedures.
   

 3. If a notice of disagreement is duly delivered pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_, Parent and the Shareholders\' Representative shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working Capital. If during such fifteen (15) day period, Parent and the Shareholders\' Representative are unable to reach agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to review this _Section 2.4_ and related definitions and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital (it being understood that in making such calculation the Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and Parent\'s Calculation as to which the parties disagree and shall utilize the Company Accounting Policies as in effect at the Effective Time. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Parent and the Shareholders\' Representative, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth the Accounting Referee\'s calculation of the disputed items or amounts. Such report shall be final and binding upon Parent and the Shareholders\' Representative. The cost of such review and report shall be allocated between Parent and the Shareholders\' Representative in its capacity as such (such cost, if any, to be reimbursed to the Shareholders\' Representative pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_) as determined by the Accounting Referee.
   

 4. Parent, the Shareholders\' Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement, the Representative\'s Calculation and Parent\'s review of the Representative\'s Calculation, including making available any necessary books, records, work papers and personnel (including representatives of the Surviving Corporation\'s outside auditor) that may be required to create the Representative\'s Calculation or to review the same.
   

 5. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, such positive amount, if any, shall be transferred by Parent to the Paying Agent for the benefit of all Shareholders (other than any portion attributable to holders of Dissenting Shares), the holder of Phantom Stock and all Warrantholders entitled to receive a portion of the consideration pursuant to _ARTICLE III_ , together with interest thereon, as provided in _Section 2.5_ hereof, and such amount shall be distributed by the Paying Agent such Persons in accordance with the Shareholder Percentage. The portion of the Adjustment Amount allocated to the unexercised Convertible Securities shall be retained by Parent.
   

 6. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, then Parent and the Shareholders\' Representative shall immediately instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent from the Working Capital Hold-Back and, if necessary, the Indemnification Hold-Back, an amount equal to such Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon as provided in _Section 2.5_ hereof.
      

 5. _Payment of Adjustment Amount_. Within three (3) business days after Final Working Capital has been determined (the " _Working Capital Hold-Back Release Date_ "), the payment or delivery, as applicable, of any Adjustment Amount, either from Parent or from the Escrow Fund, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent or the Shareholders\' Representative, as the case may be. The Adjustment Amount shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date of payment or delivery, as applicable, at a rate equal to the average daily interest rate earned on the Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment or delivery, as applicable. Such interest shall be payable or delivered, as applicable, at the same time as the payment or delivery, as applicable, to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) days and the actual number of days elapsed.
   

 6. _Treatment of Phantom Stock, Warrants and Cashless Exercise Options_. For purposes of determining all calculations under _ARTICLE II_ and _ARTICLE III_ , if the appropriate Acknowledgement Form is signed and delivered to Parent prior to Closing as provided in _Section 3.6_, the holder of Phantom Stock shall be deemed to hold such number of shares as are set forth on his Acknowledgement Form and the Warrantholders and Cashless Exercise Shareholders shall be deemed to hold the total number of Shares underlying the Warrants or Cashless Exercise Options, as applicable, held by such Person and shall be entitled to receive the Aggregate Per Share Consideration (less, with respect to the Warrantholders and Cashless Exercise Shareholders, the applicable exercise price) as though the holder was a Regular Shareholder of such Shares. The Shares deemed held by the holder of Phantom Stock, the Warrantholders and the Cashless Exercise Shareholders shall be included for all purposes of allocating the aggregate consideration to be distributed to the Regular Shareholders, the holder of Phantom Stock, the Warrantholders and the Cashless Exercise Shareholders entitled thereto.
      

 3. CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES; APPRAISAL RIGHTS

         

 1. _Conversion_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or any holders of any securities of Merger Sub or the Company:
         

 1. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
   

 2. Any Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
   

 3. Each issued and outstanding Share held by Regular Shareholders (other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares), and each Share deemed to be held by the holder of Phantom Stock, the Warrantholders and the Cashless Exercise Shareholders, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into and be exchanged for the right to receive, in the case of Regular Shareholders, upon surrender, in the manner provided in this Agreement, of the certificate formerly representing such Share, in the case of the holder of Phantom Stock and the Warrantholders, upon the execution and delivery to the Company of an Acknowledgement Form, and in the case of the Cashless Exercise Shareholders, upon the, the exercise of the applicable Cashless Exercise Option in accordance with _Section 3.5_, without interest, an amount equal to the aggregate value of the Closing Consideration divided by the number of Fully Diluted Shares (the " _Per Share Closing Consideration_ ") payable in the following manner:
          _

 1. Non-Accredited Shareholders_. As to each Share held or deemed to be held by Non-Accredited Shareholders, an amount of cash equal to the Per Share Closing Consideration (the " _Non-Accredited Per Share Closing Consideration_ "). The Non-Accredited Per Share Closing Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares held by the Non-Accredited Shareholders immediately prior to the Effective Time is referred to herein as the " _Non-Accredited Closing Consideration_ ".
    _

 2. Accredited Shareholders_. As to each Share held or deemed to be held by Accredited Shareholders (the " _Accredited Per Share Closing Consideration_ "):
         

 1. a cash amount equal to the Closing Cash Consideration less the Non-Accredited Closing Consideration and then divided by the number of outstanding Shares held or deemed to be held in the aggregate immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Accredited Shareholders (the " _Accredited Per Share Cash Closing Consideration_ "); plus
   

 2. a number of shares of ProQuest Common Stock equal to $20,000,000 divided by the ProQuest Stock Price and then further divided by the number of Shares held and deemed to be held in the aggregate immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Accredited Shareholders; plus
   

 3. any cash payment to be made in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.4_ (collectively with (1) and (2) above, the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ ").
      

 3. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Parent shall retain for its account the aggregate exercise amount from the cash portions of the distributions in (i) and (ii) to be made to Warrantholders and Cashless Exercise Shareholders. Any distributions made to Warrantholders or Cashless Exercise Shareholders pursuant to this _Section 3.1(c)_ shall be reduced by the per share exercise price of the Warrant or Cashless Exercise Option applicable to each share of Company Common Stock deemed to be held by such Warrantholder or Cashless Exercise Shareholder. For purposes of clarity neither the Accredited Per Share Closing Consideration nor the Non-Accredited Per Share Closing Consideration shall be deemed to be reduced by the retention by Parent of such amounts.
      

 4. Subject to _Section 3.3_, all Shares (other than Dissenting Shares and the rights of the holder of Phantom Stock, the Warrantholders and the Cashless Exercise Shareholders), when so converted at the Effective Time, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, Phantom Stock Agreement, Warrant or agreement with respect to a Cashless Exercise Option that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented or was deemed to represent any such Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon, in the case of a Regular Shareholder, the surrender of such certificate, in the case of the holder of Phantom Stock and any Warrantholder, the delivery of an Acknowledgement Form, and, in the case of a Cashless Exercise Shareholder, a Cashless Exercise Notice, in accordance with this Agreement, without interest: 
         

 1. the Per Share Closing Consideration in the manner described in subsection (c) above,
   

 2. in the case of Accredited Shareholders, any dividends or other distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_, if any,
   

 3. an amount of cash equal to the Contingent Consideration, if any, divided by the total number of Fully Diluted Shares without regard to the status as either an Accredited Shareholder or Non-Accredited Shareholder (such amount, the " _Per Share Contingent Consideration_ "), and
   

 4. an amount equal to any Additional Consideration, if any, payable to Shareholders, the holder of Phantom Stock and Warrantholders, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, divided by the total number of Fully Diluted Shares without regard to the status as either an Accredited Shareholder or Non-Accredited Shareholder (such amount, the " _Per Share Additional Consideration_ " and collectively with the Per Share Closing Consideration, any cash, dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_, and the Per Share Contingent Consideration, the " _Aggregate Per Share Consideration_ ").
      

 5. In the event that any Convertible Security that is unexercised as of the Effective Time subsequently lapses without exercise and therefore terminates (a " _Lapsed Option_ "), the amount equal to the Future Option Payout with respect thereto shall be promptly paid to the Paying Agent to be distributed to all Shareholders, the holder of Phantom Stock and the Warrantholders entitled to receive a portion of the consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (with the portion attributable to Dissenters Shares and unexercised Convertible Securities to be retained by Parent); _provided_ , _however_ , that in calculating any amount due to the Shareholders, the holder of Phantom Stock and the Warrantholders pursuant hereto, the per share portion to be received by each Shareholder, the holder of Phantom Stock and the Warrantholders shall be an amount equal to the aggregate consideration paid over to the Paying Agent divided by the number of Fully Diluted Shares, _less_ the Lapsed Options; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no such payment need be made until the aggregate Future Option Payouts with respect to Lapsed Options is greater than Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000), and then all of such amount shall be so paid to the Paying Agent.
      

 2. _Exchange of Certificates_.
          _

 1. Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ into the right to receive the Aggregate Per Share Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal, in the form set forth as _Exhibit E_ hereto (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Aggregate Per Share Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Aggregate Per Share Consideration, without interest, for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Aggregate Per Share Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Aggregate Per Share Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Other than rights to any declared but unpaid dividend that is either expressly disclosed on the Company\'s disclosure schedules delivered herewith or otherwise approved in writing by Parent, until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Aggregate Per Share Consideration as contemplated by this _ARTICLE III_ , without interest.
    _

 2. Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Per Share Closing Consideration, and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to and _Section 3.2(f)_, paid or to be paid in respect of each Share upon the surrender for exchange of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Share of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate (except for the right to receive the Per Share Additional Consideration and the Per Share Contingent Consideration, if any, as provided in this Agreement), and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. Except for the right to receive their respective Aggregate Per Share Consideration, from and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to _Section 3.2(d)_, if, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE III_.
    _

 3. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. On or after the Effective Time, if any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit and an indemnity (but with respect to any Shareholder who holds fewer than 1,000 Shares in the aggregate, without the need to post any bond or provide any letters of credit or other credit enhancements), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, of that fact by the registered shareholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Aggregate Per Share Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _ARTICLE III_.
   

 4. _Final Distribution of Funds By Paying Agent; No Liability_. At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to pay to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates (including for this section the Phantom Stock, Warrants and Cashless Exercise Options), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Aggregate Per Share Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any portion of the Stock Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for six (6) months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Shareholders who have not complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for the ProQuest Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_, any cash in lieu of fractional ProQuest Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.4_ and any dividends or other distributions which respect to the ProQuest Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Aggregate Per Share Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any Shareholder, holder of Phantom Stock and any Warrantholder for any cash delivered to the Shareholders\' Representative, whether or not acting as Shareholders\' Representative, on behalf of such holders, or the Paying Agent.
    _

 5. Withholding Taxes_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to or on behalf of a Shareholder or other recipient of consideration as contemplated hereby such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Shareholder or other recipient in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent on the Closing Date as to any amounts that are required to be withheld and shall present reasonable supporting documentation regarding such withholding.
   

 6. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged ProQuest Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to the ProQuest Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the ProQuest Common Stock entitled to be received upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.4_, until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate as provided in _Section 3.2_. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of ProQuest Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (in addition to the Accredited Per Share Cash Consideration), without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of ProQuest Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.4_ and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore payable with respect to such whole ProQuest Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole ProQuest Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required thereon.
      

 3. _Appraisal Rights_.
         

 1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares held by holders who continue to have rights to appraisal under the TBCA (the " _Dissenting Shareholders_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Aggregate Per Share Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), unless and until the holder or holders thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the TBCA. If any Dissenting Shareholder (i) shall have failed to perfect or (ii) shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, and, in the case of clause (ii) such holder shall acknowledge such fact in writing to the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporation, such holder\'s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Aggregate Per Share Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with _Section 3.1_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the TBCA and received by the Company relating to Shareholders\' rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the TBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.
   

 2. In the event that there are any Dissenting Shares at the Effective Time, the amounts to be deposited into the Escrow Fund attributable to such Dissenting Shares shall be withheld by Parent at the Effective Time, and the Closing Consideration shall be reduced by such amounts.
      

 4. _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of ProQuest Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to ProQuest Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former Shareholder, the holder of Phantom Stock and Warrantholder who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of ProQuest Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share of ProQuest Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the Average Closing Price. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all Shares owned or deemed to be owned by an Accredited Shareholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole Shares issuable to such Accredited Shareholder.
   

 5. _Convertible Securities_.
         

 1. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that each outstanding option to acquire Company Common Stock issued under the Stock Plans listed in _Schedule 3.5(a)_ (each, a " _Schedule 3.5(a) Company Option_ ") shall be canceled and terminated as of the Effective Time without any further action by the Parent, the Company or the holder thereof on or after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its Board of Directors and any committee thereof shall take any and all actions (including but not limited to providing requisite notices to holders of Schedule 3.5(a) Company Options advising them of such cancellations and providing a means for the exercise of Section 3.5(a) Company Options on a cashless basis to the maximum extent possible pursuant to the terms of the Stock Plans) (A) as are necessary to fully advise holders of Schedule 3.5(a) Company Options of their rights under the applicable Stock Plans in connection with the Merger and (B) as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.5(a)_ under the terms of the Stock Plans.

 2. If the Closing has not occurred on or before the termination date of the Financing Commitments and this Agreement has not been properly terminated, Parent and Merger Sub will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and if obtained will provide the Company with a copy of, either an extension of the Financing Commitments or a new financing commitment that, in either case, provides for at least the same amount of financing as the Financing Commitments as originally issued on terms (including funding conditions) not less beneficial in the aggregate to Parent compared to those included in the Financing Commitments as originally issued, and any such extension or new commitment shall include a termination date not earlier than the Walk-Away Date.

Such notice shall to the extent reasonably known (i) identify specifically the basis under which indemnification is sought pursuant to _Section 9.2_, (ii) identify the provision(s) of this Agreement applicable to, and upon which, such indemnification claim is based and the facts surrounding the alleged breach or noncompliance by the Company of such provision(s), and (iii) enclose true and correct copies of any written document furnished to the indemnified party by the Person that instituted the Claim, if any. The indemnified party shall thereafter provide the indemnifying party reasonable access to the books, records, properties and personnel of the indemnified party as it reasonably requests for the purpose of investigating such Claim; _provided, however,_ that such investigation and examination shall be during regular business hours and under reasonable circumstances. For all purposes of this _ARTICLE IX_ , the Shareholders\' Representative will act on behalf of the Shareholders in their capacity as indemnified parties or indemnifying parties. No Shareholder can seek indemnification hereunder except through the Shareholders\' Representative.
   

 2. The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder so long as:
         

 1. If an indemnifying party is deemed to be a Shareholder, the maximum amount of the Claim does not exceed thirty-seven percent (37%) of the amount remaining in the Indemnification Hold-Back which is not already subject to a Claim,
   

 2. If an indemnifying party is deemed to be a Shareholder, the Shareholders\' Representative provides the indemnified party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party that the Shareholders\' Representative will have the financial resources to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with the Claim and fulfill the Shareholders\' Representative\'s obligations hereunder, provided that the remaining portion of the Shareholders\' Representative Hold-Back shall be given due consideration as a resource of the Shareholders\' Representative,
   

 3. If an indemnifying party is deemed to be a Shareholder, the Claim does not relate to criminal conduct, involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief,
   

 4. If an indemnifying party is deemed to be a Shareholder, the Shareholders\' Representative confirms in writing the validity of the indemnification claim (without admission of liability as to the underlying claim) and the availability of the Escrow Funds with respect thereto,
   

 5. settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the indemnified party, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the continuing business interests of the indemnified party; and
   

 6. the indemnifying party conducts the defense, negotiations, settlement or other dealings of the Claim actively and diligently.
      

 3. If Parent is the indemnifying party and is conducting the defense, negotiations, settlement or other dealings of the Claim, Parent will proceed actively and diligently and otherwise in a manner consistent with its historic course of conduct in dealing with similar actions or claims.
   

 4. If the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, it shall within fifteen (15) days after the indemnified party has given notice of the Claim notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Claim; _provided, however,_ that if the indemnified party defends, negotiates or otherwise deals with any Claim under such circumstances, the indemnified party shall not settle any Claim or make any admission of guilt or liability without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Claim; _provided, however,_ that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, only if so requested by the indemnifying party to participate; and _provided, further,_ that not more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties shall be provided in connection with any Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Claim. Notwithstanding whether the indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party to the extent not prohibited by contract or Law shall promptly supply to the indemnifying party copies of all material correspondence and documents relating to or in connection with such Claim and keep the indemnifying party reasonably informed of all developments relating to or in connection with such Claim (including, without limitation, providing to the indemnifying party on request updates and summaries as to the status thereof).
   

 5. So long as the indemnifying party deals with or otherwise is conducting the defense or negotiation of the Claim in accordance with _Section 9.4(b)_, the indemnifying party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment, settle any Claim or make any admission of guilt or liability without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
   

 6. In the event any of the conditions in _Section 9.4(b)_ above is or becomes unsatisfied, however, (i) the indemnified party may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the indemnified party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the indemnifying party in connection therewith), and (ii) the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the Claim (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses of one outside counsel) from the funds in the Indemnification Hold-Back.
   

 7. After any final decision or award shall have been rendered, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder, the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing, which sums shall be paid solely out of any funds in the Indemnification Hold-Back or by the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.
   

 8. The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Claim or keep the indemnifying party reasonably informed thereof shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnification obligations of the indemnifying party with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.
      

 5. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the indemnifications provided in this _ARTICLE IX_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedies after Closing: (i) of the Parent and its affiliates with respect to all breaches and failures of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereof and the acts and omissions of the Company, and (ii) of the Shareholders with respect to all breaches and failures of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements hereof and the acts or omissions of Parent or Merger Sub, except in all cases that all remedies for fraud (including fraud in the inducement) shall be available. The parties agree that the pre-Closing covenants of the Company and Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement will not survive the Closing, although the certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ and _Section 7.3(c)_ shall survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be liable to or otherwise responsible to any other party for punitive, consequential or special damages of any kind, except to the extent a successful third party Claim includes any of the foregoing.

No bond shall be required of the Shareholders\' Representative and the Shareholders\' Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services, except as provided in _Section 10.1(c)_ below. The Shareholders\' Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have acted in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment with respect to any act done or omission to act if the act or omission occurred in reliance by the Shareholders\' Representative upon the advice of counsel or other professional advisors. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders\' Representative shall constitute a decision for all Shareholders hereunder and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Shareholder, and the Escrow Agent, the Parent, and the Surviving Corporation may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders\' Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of all Shareholders. Notice to the Shareholders\' Representative shall be deemed notice to all holders of Company Common Stock for purposes of this Agreement. The power and authority of the Shareholders\' Representative, as described in this Agreement, is coupled with an interest, irrevocable and shall continue in force until all rights and obligations of the Parties have terminated, expired or been fully performed. The Surviving Corporation is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders\' Representative.

The Shareholders shall severally, but not jointly, on a pro rata basis in proportion to the amount of consideration received by them, reimburse the Shareholders\' Representative first, out of any funds in the Shareholders\' Representative Hold-Back, and then individually, for any and all Losses, fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acceptance and administration of the Shareholders\' Representative\'s duties hereunder, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal counsel or other advisors incurred in connection with any matter arising pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Shareholders\' Representative shall not be required to incur any costs or expenses in furtherance of its obligations hereunder from its own funds unless and until it shall have received an undertaking, satisfactory to it in its sole discretion, from the Shareholders to reimburse it for all Losses, fees, costs and expenses so incurred.
    _

 4. Removal of Shareholders\' Representative_. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor of the Shareholders\' Representative as provided below, the Shareholders\' Representative may be removed at any time with or without cause by action of the Shareholders who represent a majority of the Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.

If no successor shall have been appointed by the Shareholders and have accepted such appointment within twenty (20) days after the Shareholders\' Representative\'s removal, then the Shareholders\' Representative may, on behalf of the Shareholders, appoint a successor, which shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent. During any vacancy, the Shareholders\' Representative may fully act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Shareholders\' Representative hereunder, such successor Shareholders\' Representative shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the Shareholders\' Representative.

 6. Except for a notice regarding the change of the Shareholders\' Representative or with respect to dissenters\' rights, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to disregard any notices or communications given or made by any Shareholder unless given or made through the Shareholders\' Representative.
