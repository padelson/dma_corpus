iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 10,
2003, between Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
("Parent"), and Patriot Bank Corp., a Pennsylvania corporation (the
"Company"). Parent and the Company are sometimes collectively referred to
herein as the "Constituent Corporations." 



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
herein in which the Company will, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, merge (the "Merger") with and into Parent;



WHEREAS, as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Farmers First Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Parent Bank") and Patriot Bank,
a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (the "Company Bank"), will enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Bank Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company Bank shall merge
with and into the Parent Bank (the "Bank Merger"), with the Parent Bank
constituting the surviving bank (the "Surviving Bank") and it is intended that
the Bank Merger be consummated immediately following the consummation of the
Merger; and



WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "PBCL"), at
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the Company shall merge
with and into Parent. Parent shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be
Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Company shall cease.



 

1 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, articles of
merger complying with the PBCL (the "Articles of Merger") shall be duly
prepared, executed and delivered for filing with the Department of State of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Department"), in each case on the
Closing Date (as defined in Section 10.1 hereof). The Merger shall become
effective (such time, the "Effective Time") at such time as the Articles of
Merger are filed by the Department or at such later time as may be specified
in the Articles of Merger.

 



1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 1929 of the PBCL.



1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.



(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Article I,
and Sections 2.2(e) and Section 9.1(g) hereof, each share of the common stock,
no par value per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below) (except for Trust
Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms are defined in Section 1.4(d)
hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the right to
receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to
the provisions of Section 1.5, either (i) the Per Share Stock Consideration
(as defined below) or (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as defined
below). The Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration are referred to herein collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."



For purposes of this Agreement:



"Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean a number of shares of common stock,
par value $2.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the
Exchange Ratio.



"Per Share Cash Consideration" shall mean $30.00.



"Exchange Ratio" shall mean 1.143.



"Total Cash Amount" shall mean 20% of the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the Per Share Cash Consideration and (y) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the Determination
Date.



"Determination Date" shall mean the third calendar day immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or if such calendar day is not a trading day on the
NASDAQ/NMS, then the trading day immediately preceding such calendar day.



(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a  



 

2  certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger
Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.2(b) hereof, and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof.



(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Stock Consideration.



(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than shares of Company Common Stock (x) held directly or
indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held
in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties (any such shares, and
shares of Parent Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly
or indirectly by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, being referred to
herein as "Trust Account Shares") and (y) held by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously
contracted (any such shares of Company Common Stock, and shares of Parent
Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by
Parent or the Company, being referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Parent
Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become treasury stock of
Parent.



(e) The calculations required by Section 1.4(a) shall be prepared jointly by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing Date.



1.5 _Election Procedures_.



(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates theretofore representing shares of Company
Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to
the Exchange Agent (as defined below)) in such form as Parent and the Company
shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") shall be mailed 35 days prior to
the anticipated Effective Date or on such other date as the Company and
Parent shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth business day
prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").



(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to  



 

3  specify (i) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with
respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration ("Stock Election Shares"), (ii) the number of shares of
such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration ("Cash Election Shares"), or
(iii) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holders
Company Common Stock ("No Election Shares"). Any Company Common Stock with
respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly
completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., on the 33rd day following the
Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline") shall also be deemed to be "No
Election Shares." 



(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.



(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such certificates) representing all shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election Form at or prior to
the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Election Form shall become No Election Shares and Parent shall cause the
certificates representing such Company Common Stock to be promptly returned
without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request
to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or
change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in
the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form.



(e) Within ten business days after the Election Deadline, unless the
Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon thereafter as
practicable, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among the holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive Parent Common
Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:



(1) _Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount_. If the sum of the
aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion in  



 

4  the Merger of the Cash Election Shares plus the aggregate amount of cash
paid in respect of options to purchase Company Common Stock under Section
1.6(b) or any other provisions of this Agreement (such sum hereinafter, the
"Section 1.5(e) Cash Amount") is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:



(A) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,



(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Stock
Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in
the Merger (including, without limitation, any cash paid in respect of options
to purchase Company Common Stock under Section 1.6(b) or any other provision
of this Agreement) equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and
all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration, and



(C) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.



(2) _Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:



(A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,



(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro
rata selection process (excluding, to the extent possible, shares of Company
Common Stock acquired through the exercise of any incentive stock option at
any time within twelve months prior to the Effective Date, which shares are
identified on Exhibit 1.5(e)(2)(B) hereto), a sufficient number of shares
("Cash Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be
paid in the Merger (including, without limitation, any cash paid in respect of
options to purchase Company Common Stock under Section 1.6(b) or any other
provision of this Agreement) equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash
Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and



 

5 (C) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.



(3) _Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount_. If the Section 1.5(e)
Cash Amount is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to
the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (1) and (2) above shall not apply
and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No Election
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration.

 



(f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined
by Parent and the Company.



1.6 _Option Plans; Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each unexercised stock option outstanding to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Companys 1996 Stock-Based
Incentive Plan (the "1996 Plan") and the Companys 2002 Stock-Based Option
Plan (collectively, the "Company Option Plans") that is intended to qualify as
an incentive stock option (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code)
(each a "Company ISO"), whether or not vested or exercisable, and each Company
Option Plan, shall be assumed by Parent in a transaction described in Section
424(a) of the Code. Each Company ISO so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions of such Company ISO immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, any vesting provisions), except that (i) each
Company ISO will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
with its terms) for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company ISO immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such assumed
Company ISO will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company ISO was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deliver to the holders of Company ISOs, notices describing the conversion of
such Company ISOs (as modified by this Section 1.6(a)), and the agreements
evidencing the Company ISOs shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (as modified by this Section 1.6(a)). Parent shall comply with the
terms of all such Company ISOs. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to
satisfy Parents obligations under this Section 1.6(a). As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement or
statements on Form  



 

6  S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to Company ISOs assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement. 



(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexercised stock option
outstanding to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company
Option Plans that is a nonqualified stock option, which is a stock option not

ARTICLE II



EXCHANGE OF SHARES



2.1 _Parent to Make Shares and Cash Available_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or
trust company (which may be a Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange Agent")
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the benefit
of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) such cash as shall be necessary to pay
the Per Share Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4 and 2.2(a)
hereof, and (iii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid in
accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof. Such cash and certificates for shares
of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund."



2.2 _Exchange of Shares_. (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in no event more than three business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent
shall  



 

8  mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who
theretofore has not submitted such holders Certificate or Certificates with
a properly completed Election Form, a form letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. The Company shall have
the right to review both the letter of transmittal and the instructions prior
to the Effective Time and provide reasonable comments thereon. After
completion of the allocation procedure set forth in Section 1.5 and upon
surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with a properly executed letter of transmittal
or Election Form, as the case may be, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder of Company Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant
to the provisions of Article I hereof and/or (y) a check representing the
aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and/or the amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of Article I, and the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Per
Share Cash Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares or the unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.



(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the
record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.



(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the  



 

9  Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock or cash or both, as provided in
this Article II.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing sale
prices of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ/NMS as reported by The Wall
Street Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding the date on
which the Effective Time shall occur by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.



(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares
and/or the unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder
of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.



(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Subject to Article III, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
as follows:



4.1 _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on the Company. The Company is duly registered as a bank holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC
Act"). The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, copies of
which have previously been made available to Parent, are true and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As
used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with
respect to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, a material adverse
effect on (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of
such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any such effect
attributable to or resulting from (v) any change in banking or similar laws,
rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereof by
courts or governmental authorities, (w) any change in GAAP or regulatory
accounting principles applicable to banks, thrifts or their holding companies
generally, (x) changes attributable to or resulting from changes in general
economic conditions, including changes in the prevailing level of interest
rates, (y) any action or omission of the Company or Parent or any Subsidiary
of either of them taken in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or with

Bank Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due. Each of the Companys other Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization. Each of the  



 

11  Companys Subsidiaries has the corporate (or equivalent) power and authority

Subsidiary. The articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing
documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, copies of which have previously
been made available to Parent, are true and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the

limited liability company, partnership or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated with such party for
financial reporting purposes.

for (x) 634,297 shares of Company Common Stock reserved pursuant to
the Company Option Plans and (y) 275,000 shares of Company Common Stock
reserved pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"). All

preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. Except as referred to above or reflected in Section 4.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not have and is not bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares

connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except that Parent has engaged, and will pay a fee or commission to, Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods, Inc. ("KBW").



5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as may be set forth in
Section 5.8 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or as disclosed in the
2002 Parent Audited Financial Statements or the September 30 Parent Unaudited
Financial Statements or any Parent Report (as defined in Section 5.5) filed
with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31, 2002
there has been no change or development or combination of changes or
developments which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Parent.



5.9 _Taxes_. (a) Except as may be set forth in Section 5.9(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries has (i) duly and
timely filed (including applicable extensions granted without penalty) all
material Tax Returns required to be filed at or prior to the Effective Time,
and all such Tax Returns are true and correct in all material respects, and
(ii) paid in full or made adequate provision in the financial statements of
the Parent (in accordance with GAAP) for all Taxes required to be paid by
them, whether or not shown to be due on such Tax Returns. Except as set forth
in Section 5.9(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof
(i) neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested any extension
of time within which to file any Tax Returns in respect of any fiscal year
which have not since been filed and no request for waivers of the time to
assess any Taxes are pending or outstanding, (ii) with respect to each taxable
period of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, the federal and state income Tax
Returns of the Parent and its Subsidiaries have been audited by the IRS or
appropriate state tax authorities through December 31, 2000 or the time for
assessing and collecting income Tax with respect to such taxable period has
closed and such taxable period is not subject to review, and (iii) there are
no claims, audits or assessments pending against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries for any alleged deficiency in Taxes, and the Parent has not been
notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims, audits or assessments against
the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, in each case, claims,
audits or assessments for which adequate reserves in the financial statements
of the Parent have been established). There are no material liens for Taxes
upon the assets of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable. None of the Parent or any
Subsidiary is a party to any agreement or arrangement that would reasonably be
expected to result, as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger), separately or in the aggregate, in
the actual or deemed payment by the Parent or any Subsidiary of any "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or that
would be nondeductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. All Taxes required to
be withheld, collected or deposited by or with respect to the Parent and its
Subsidiaries have been timely withheld, collected or deposited, as the case
may be, and, to the extent  



 

27  required, have been paid to the relevant taxing authority. Neither the
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in income any
adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code (or any similar provision
of law or regulations) by reason of a change in accounting method.



5.10 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement and the S-4, or in
any other document filed with any other regulatory agency in connection
herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement
(except for such portions thereof that relate to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) will comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. The S-4 will comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.



5.11 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. The Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
holds all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and pursuant to all, and
have complied, in all material respects, with and are not in default in any
material respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation,
policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, and neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received notice of any violations of any of the above.



5.12 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Except as may be set forth in
Section 5.12 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither the Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is or since December 31, 2001 has been subject to any cease-
and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any Regulatory Agreement
whether or not set forth on Section 5.12 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
any Regulatory Agency that restricts the conduct of its business or that in
any manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its
management or its business, nor has the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised by any Regulatory Agency that it is considering issuing or requesting
any Regulatory Agreement.

(a) Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates or associates (as such terms are
defined under the Exchange Act) (i) beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, or (ii) is a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding
for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of
capital stock of the Company (other than Trust Account Shares or DPC shares);
and 



(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "interested shareholder"
of the Company (as such terms are defined in Section 2553 of the PBCL).



 

28 5.14 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has received
an opinion from KBW to the effect that as of the date thereof and based upon
and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be
paid by Parent is fair to Parent from a financial point of view.



5.15 _Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent knows of no reason
why all regulatory approvals required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) should not be obtained.



5.16 _Reorganization_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason
to believe that the Merger will fail to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.



5.17 _Financing_. Parent at Closing will have available sufficient cash and
cash equivalents on hand to pay the Total Cash Amount as contemplated by
Section 1.4 hereof.

to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the
other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that
they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of
all permits,

date of this Agreement) from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to,
any Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.



7.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each party shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party,
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records,
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives and,
during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make
available to the other party all information concerning its business,

this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding

33 7.3 _Certain Actions_. (a) Except with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and except as otherwise permitted in this
Section 7.3, the Company will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its
directors, officers, agents, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, advisors, agents, affiliates (as such term is used in Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act) or representatives (collectively, "Representatives")
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or take any
action to facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiries with respect to or
the making of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business,

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and its Board
of Directors shall be permitted (i) to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal
(provided that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not withdraw or
modify in an adverse manner its approval recommendation referred to in
Section 7.4 hereof except as set forth below), (ii) to engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person in
response to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) by any such person, if and
only to the extent that (x) the Companys Board of Directors concludes in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so
would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable law, (y) prior to providing any information or
data to any person in connection with a Superior Proposal by any such person,
the Companys Board of Directors receives from such person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements and the Parent (a copy of
which executed confidentiality agreement shall have been provided to the
Parent for informational purposes), and (z) at least 72 hours prior to
providing any information or data to any person or entering into discussions
or negotiations with any person, the Company notifies Parent in writing
promptly of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and (iii) to withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its shareholders
referred to in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior Proposal. The
Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent
in writing of the receipt of any  



 

34  Acquisition Proposal or any information related thereto, which notification
shall describe the Acquisition Proposal and identify the third party making
the same.



(c) The Company agrees that it will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions, or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.



(d) For purposes of this Section 7.3:



(i) The term "Acquisition Proposal" means any tender offer or exchange offer
or any proposal for a merger, acquisition of all of the stock or assets of, or
other business combination involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the acquisition of a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial portion
of the assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



(ii) The term "Superior Proposal" means, with respect to the Company, any
bona-fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made by a person other
than Parent which is on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith concludes (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal, (A) is more favorable to its shareholders (in their capacities
as shareholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for
which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B)
is reasonably capable of being completed.



(e) If a Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company shall pay
to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within two (2)
Business Days following such Payment Event, a fee of $8,500,000 (the "Break-up
Fee").



"Payment Event" means (x) the termination of this Agreement by Parent
pursuant to Section 9.1(f) (as a result of a breach by the Company of any of
its covenants under Section 7.3(a) or (c), Section 7.4 or 7.5) or pursuant to
Section 9.1(h), or (y) the occurrence of any of the following events within
twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(c), provided that an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made after the
date hereof and prior to such termination (which shall not have been withdrawn
in good faith prior to such termination): (i) the Company merges with or
into, or is acquired, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise by, a
Third Party; (ii) a Third Party, directly or indirectly acquires more than 50%
of the total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
(iii) a Third Party, directly or indirectly, acquires more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock; or (iv) the  



 

35  Company adopts or implements a plan of liquidation, recapitalization or
share repurchase relating to more than 50% of the outstanding Company Common
Stock or an extraordinary dividend relating to more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or 50% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As used herein, "Third Party" means any person
as defined in section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (other than Parent or its
affiliates).



(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 7.3(e)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and
that without these agreements Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event the Company fails to pay to Parent the Break-up Fee,
promptly when due, the Company shall, in addition thereto, pay to Parent all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred
in collecting such Break-up Fee together with interest on the amount of the
Break-up Fee (or any unpaid portion thereof), from the date such payment was
due until the date such payment is received by Parent, accrued at the
fluctuating prime rate (as quoted in The Wall Street Journal) as in effect
from time to time during the period.



7.4 _Shareholder Meetings_. The Company and Parent each shall take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
respective shareholders to be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after
the date on which the S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject, in the case of the Company, to the right of
the Company and its Board of Directors to take action permitted by Section
7.3(b) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company and Parent each will,
through its respective Board of Directors, recommend to its respective
shareholders approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and such other matters as may be submitted to its shareholders in
connection with this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate with respect to the foregoing matters, with a view towards, among
other things, holding the respective meetings of each partys shareholders on
the same day.



7.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by,
any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be
obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of such consent,
authorization, order or approval.



7.6 _Affiliates_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes  



 

36  of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of the Company to deliver to Parent,
as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, a written agreement,
in the form of Exhibit 7.6 hereto.



7.7 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NASDAQ/NMS, subject to official notice of
issuance, as of the Effective Time. 



7.8 _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements_. (a) Following the
Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Company Employees") shall be eligible to participate in employee benefit
plans, including severance plans (each a "Parent Plan"), of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent that similarly situated employees
of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate; provided, however, that, in the
case of all benefits then provided to the Company Employees, until the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent may instead provide such employees
with participation in the employee benefit plans of the Company on a basis
that is no less favorable to such employees than those plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood that
inclusion of Company Employees in Parents employee benefit plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans). From and after the
Effective Time, Parent may elect not to provide to the Company Employees any
benefits which are not then provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to their
employees notwithstanding that such benefits were provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries to their employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In the case of benefits which are provided at the Effective Time by Parent to
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries but are not then provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to their employees, Parent will as soon as
possible, and in all events within one year, after the Effective Time include
the Company Employees in the plans under which such benefits are made
available.



(b) With respect to each Parent Plan for which length of service is taken
into account for any purpose, service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past
service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits,
including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual
of defined benefit pension benefits); provided however, that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any preexisting condition limitations. Each Parent Plan shall
waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
applicable Company Plan. Company Employees shall be given credit for amounts
paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same period for purposes
of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Parent Plan.



 

37 (c) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent to assume and to honor in accordance
with their terms all agreements listed in Section 7.8 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the "Benefit Agreements"). Parent acknowledges and agrees
that the Merger will constitute a "change in control" of the Company for all
purposes under such agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.8(c) are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director,
officer or employee that is a party to any Benefit Agreement.



(d) Parent and the Company agree that, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may adopt a severance plan (the "Severance Plan") and a change in
control retention plan (the "Retention Plan"), each substantially as provided
in Section 6.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any Plan or otherwise, Parent agrees from
and after the Closing Date to maintain in full force and effect, without
amendment or modification, (i) for a period of no less than one year
following the Closing Date, the Severance Plan and (ii) the Retention Plan
until such time as all Parent or Company obligations are fulfilled thereunder.



7.9 _Indemnification_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole
or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the
fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, any of
the Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their respective predecessors or
affiliates or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to
defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the
Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation incurred by each Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent;
provided, however, that (1) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and upon such assumption Parent shall not be liable to
any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are issues
which raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified Parties,
the Indemnified Parties may retain  



 

38  counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent, and
Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Parties, (2) Parent shall in all cases be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties, (3) Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
(4) Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law, and (5) Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party in respect of any such loss, claim, damage, liability,
cost, expense, judgment or amount paid in settlements which arose out of or
resulted from the gross negligence, criminal activity, willful misconduct or
recklessness of the Indemnified Party. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim Indemnification under this Section 7.9, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Parent under this Section 7.9 except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices Parent. Parents obligations under
this Section 7.9 shall continue in full force and effect without time limit
from and after the Effective Time.



(b) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability
insurance policy maintained by the Company (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such.



(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.



(d) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this

Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.



 

39 7.11 _Coordination of Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement each of
Parent and the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock and the Company Common Stock
and the record dates and payments dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties that the holders of Company Common Stock shall not
receive more than one dividend, or fail to receive one dividend, for any
single calendar quarter with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock
and any shares of Parent Common Stock any holder of Company Common Stock
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

necessary action to terminate the ESPP effective immediately prior to the

Effective Time shall be promptly returned to such participants, and (ii) no
shares of Company Common Stock shall be purchased by participants for such
option period. In addition, upon the effective termination of the ESPP, the
Company shall distribute all shares held in participants accounts to the
respective participants in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. 



7.13 _Appointment of Directors_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause its Board of Directors to be expanded by two members, and shall
appoint the Company Directors (as defined below) to fill the vacancies on
Parents Board of Directors created by such increase. If any of the Company
Directors does not become a director of Parent because of death, disability or
otherwise, or if any of the Company Directors shall cease to be a director of
Parent at any time before the second anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent agrees, after consultation with the Bank Directors (as defined in
Section 7.14(b)), to cause a person who is a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company as of the date hereof to be elected or appointed to the Board
of Directors of Parent as the new Company Director. In connection with the
annual meeting of Parent next following the Effective Time, Parent shall
nominate each of the Company Directors for election as a director by the
shareholders of the Company, each to continue serving in the class to which
they were appointed, and Parent shall solicit proxies for their election at
such annual meeting. The term "Company Directors" shall mean the two
individuals who shall be designated by the Company, after consultation with
Parent, to become members of the Board of Directors of Parent as of the
Effective Time pursuant to this Section 7.13. Nothing in this Section 7.13
shall require the election or appointment of any individual whose election or
appointment is prohibited or advised against by any Regulatory Agency.

effective time of the Bank Merger, the Surviving Bank shall cause its Board of
Directors to be expanded by four members, and shall appoint the Bank Directors
(as defined below) to fill the vacancies on the Surviving Banks Board of
Directors created by such increase, each to hold office in accordance with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Bank until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, and (ii)
if permitted by law, the Bank Directors shall hold office for a period of no
less than two years from the effective time of the Bank Merger. The Bank
Merger Agreement shall contain other terms that are normal and customary in
light of the transactions contemplated hereby and such additional terms as
are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The term "Bank
Directors" shall mean the four individuals who shall be designated by the
Company after consultation with the Parent, to become members of the Board of
Directors of Surviving Bank as of the effective time of the Bank Merger
pursuant to the Bank Merger Agreement.



(c) If any of the Bank Directors does not become a director of the Surviving
Bank because of death, disability or otherwise, or if any of the Bank
Directors shall cease to be a director of the Surviving Bank at any time
before the second anniversary of the effective time of the Bank Merger, Parent
agrees, after consultation with the remaining Bank Directors, to cause a
person who is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company as of the
date hereof to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Bank as the new Bank Director.



7.15 _Concerning Directors of the Company_. From and after the Effective Time,
all of the director deferred compensation plan(s) of the Company in effect on
the date hereof shall be continued in place, but no additional grants shall be
authorized thereunder. From and after the Effective Time and their acceptance
of appointment as directors of Parent, each of the Company Directors will be
eligible to participate in the Parents deferred compensation plans for
directors of the Parent on the same terms as the other directors of the
Parent. In addition, Parent hereby expressly agrees and acknowledges that
upon consummation of the Merger, Parent shall succeed to all obligations to
directors (including Richard A. Elko) under the Companys supplemental
executive retirement plans. The provisions of this Section 7.15 are intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director of the
Company and his or her heirs and representatives.



7.16 _ESOP Matters_. The Company Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "Company
ESOP") shall be terminated as of the Effective Time. To the extent permitted
by applicable law and consistent with fiduciary duties owed by the trustees of
the Company ESOP, promptly after the Effective Time, the trustees of the
Company ESOP shall sell a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock received with respect to the Company Common Stock held, unallocated, in
the suspense account in the Company ESOP such that the proceeds of such sale
shall equal or exceed the then outstanding ESOP indebtedness and shall apply
the proceeds from such sale to the  



 

41  payment of the ESOP indebtedness. Any remaining shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash held in the suspense account after the repayment of the
ESOP indebtedness shall be allocated to the ESOP participants in accordance
with the terms of the Company ESOP and applicable laws and regulations. In
connection with the termination of the Company ESOP, the Company shall
promptly apply to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on the tax-
qualified status of the Company ESOP on termination and any amendments made to
the Company ESOP in connection with its termination or otherwise, if such
amendments have not previously received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS with respect to their qualification under Code Section 401(a). Any
amendments to the Company ESOP requested by the IRS prior to the Effective
Time shall be adopted by Company and Company Bank, and any
amendments requested by the IRS after the Effective Time shall be adopted by
Parent if upon advice of legal counsel to Parent that such amendments are
appropriate. Any and all distributions from the Company ESOP after its
termination shall be made consistent with the aforementioned determination
letter from the IRS. The account balances of participants in the Company ESOP
will be distributed as soon as practicable after the later of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) the receipt of a favorable determination letter for
termination of the Company ESOP from the IRS. Prior to the Effective Time,
Company and Company Bank shall make contributions to, and payments on the loan
of, the Company ESOP consistent with past practices on regularly scheduled
payment dates.

has entered into an employment agreement with the President and CEO of the
Company, pursuant to which he shall become President and CEO of the Patriot
division of the Surviving Bank commencing as of the effective time of the
Bank Merger.

Effective Time, Parent shall permit Company Employees who are terminated in
connection with the Merger to participate in Parents outplacement services
plan for employees of Parent and its subsidiaries, which outplacement

ARTICLE IX



TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT



9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of both the Company and Parent:



(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;



 

44 (b) by either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other party (i)
30 days after the date on which any request or application for a Requisite
Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or
recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite
Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such denial or
withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed
with the applicable Governmental Entity (provided, however, that no party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein) or
(ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;



(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before November 30, 2004, unless the failure of the Closing
to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of
such party set forth herein;



(d) by either Parent or the Company provided that it shall not be in material
breach of any of its obligations under Section 7.4 if any approval of the
shareholders of either of the Company or Parent required for the consummation
of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to
obtain, after the use of all reasonable efforts, the required vote at a duly
held meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof;



(e) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the
part of the other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days
following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) unless the breach of representation or
warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party
receiving such representation not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under Section 8.2(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or
warranty by the Company) or Section 8.3(a) (in the case of a breach of
representation or warranty by Parent);



(f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party,  



 

45  which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days following receipt
by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the other
party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the
Closing; or



(g) by the Company at any time during the two-day period following the
Determination Date (as defined in Section 1.4 hereof), if both of the
following conditions (1) and (2) are satisfied:



(1) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall be less than the
product of 0.800 and the Starting Price; and



(2) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the
Starting Price (such number being referred to herein as the "Parent Ratio")
shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined below)
and subtracting 0.200 from such quotient (such number being referred to
herein as the "Index Ratio");



subject to the following. If the Company elects to exercise its termination
right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt
written notice to Parent; provided that such notice of election to terminate
may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned two-day period. During
the period commencing with its receipt of such notice and ending at the
Effective Time, Parent shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio
and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration in a manner such, and to the
extent required, so that the condition set forth in either clause (1) or (2)
above shall be deemed not to exist; provided, however, that the Per Share Cash
Consideration shall not be increased in a manner that would cause the failure
of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(d) or 8.3(d) hereof.



For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:



the Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration is increased so
that the Per Share Consideration (calculated by using the Average Closing
Price, as provided in the definition of "Per Share Consideration") after
such increase is not less than 84% of the Per Share Consideration calculated
by using the Starting Price in lieu of the Average Closing Price.



For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall be
deemed not to exist if:



the Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration is increased so
that the Adjusted Parent Ratio is not less than the Index Ratio.



If Parent makes this election, within such period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio
and/or Per Share Cash Consideration, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as  



 

46  the Exchange Ratio and/or Per Share Cash Consideration, and derivatively the
Per Share Stock Consideration and/or Total Cash Amount, shall have been
so modified), and any references in this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio," "Per
Share Cash Consideration," "Per Share Stock Consideration" and "Total Cash
Amount" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio, Per Share
Cash Consideration, Per Share Stock Consideration and Total Cash Amount after
giving effect to any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9.1(g). For
purposes of this Section 9.1(g), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:



"Adjusted Parent Ratio" means the number obtained by dividing (x) the sum of
(A) the Average Closing Price plus (B) the quotient obtained by dividing the
aggregate increase in transaction value resulting from an increase in the
Exchange Ratio and/or the Per Share Cash Consideration by the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the Determination Date, by (y)
the Starting Price.



"Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported sale prices per
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ/NMS (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually
agreed upon authoritative source) for the twenty consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the Determination Date (as defined in Section 1.4(a)
hereof). 



"Index Price" on a given date means the closing price of the NASDAQ Bank
Index.



"Per Share Consideration" means the sum of (i) 80% of the product of the Per
Share Stock Consideration times the Average Closing Price plus (ii) 20% of the
Per Share Cash Consideration.



"Starting Date" means the trading day on the NASDAQ/NMS preceding the day on
which the parties publicly announce the signing of this Agreement.



"Starting Price" means the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the
trading day on NASDAQ/NMS preceding the day on which the parties publicly
announce the signing of this Agreement.



If Parent declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the prices
for the common stock of Parent shall be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 9.1(g).



(h) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation to its
shareholders referred to in Section 7.4 hereof in order to accept a Superior
Proposal, or (ii) prior to acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock
any Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)
(other than the Parent or its subsidiaries) shall have become the beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of at
least 20% of the outstanding Company Common Stock.



 

47 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.2(b), 7.3(e),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.



9.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of either
the Company or Parent; provided, however, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Companys shareholders,
there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment
of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of
the consideration to be delivered to the Company shareholders hereunder other
than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.



9.4 _Extensions; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

10.5 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect  



 

49  in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases
"the date of this Agreement," "the date hereof" and terms of similar import,
unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to December
10, 2003. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take
any action that would violate any applicable law, rule or regulation.



10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart.



10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreements between Parent and the Company.



10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard
to any applicable conflicts of law.



10.9 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that the provisions contained in 7.2(b) of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of Section
7.2(b) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.



10.10  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.



10.11 _Publicity_. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or
otherwise required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ/NMS, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company shall, or shall permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any
public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.



 

50 10.12 _Tax Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, each party hereto (and each employee, representative, or other
agent of any party) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of
any kind, the federal income tax treatment and federal income tax structure of
any and all transaction(s) contemplated herein and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to
any party (or to any employee, representative, or other agent of any party)
relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, provided, however, that this
authorization of disclosure shall not apply to restrictions reasonably
necessary to comply with securities laws. This authorization of disclosure is
not effective until the earlier of (i) the date of the public announcement
of discussions relating to the transaction, (ii) the date of the public
announcement of the transaction or (iii) the date of execution of an agreement
(with or without conditions) to enter into the transaction.



10.13 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent and the Company have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the
date first above written.
