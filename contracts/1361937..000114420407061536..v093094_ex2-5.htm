later than three business days prior to the Closing  Date, the parties shall
determine, based upon the best information reasonably  available to them, the
amount of the adjustments provided for in _Section 2.2_. **** If  the 
amount of adjustments so determined which would result in a credit to Buyer 
exceed the amount of adjustments so determined which would result in a
credit  to  Seller, Buyer shall receive a credit, for the amount of such
excess, against  the  Purchase Price to be paid at Closing, and, if the
converse is true, Buyer shall  pay to Seller, at Closing (in addition to
amounts otherwise then owed), the  amount of such excess. ****

 

 

(b) After  the  Closing, Seller shall review the computation of the
adjustments provided for  in  _Section  2.2_   which  was made at Closing
and shall submit an updated settlement statement to Buyer  within 90 days
after the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer shall thereafter meet  at  a
mutually agreeable time (but no later than 120 days ** __** after  the 
Closing Date) to (i) review the updated settlement statement submitted by 
Seller, (ii) determine in good faith whether any additional revisions are 
necessary and (iii) make any adjustments by appropriate payments from Seller 
to  Buyer or from Buyer to Seller. **** Following  such additional
adjustments, no further adjustments to the Purchase Price shall  be made

or Buyer (the " **Request  Date** "),  each  of Seller and Buyer shall
nominate and commit one of its senior officers to  meet  at a mutually
agreed time and place not later than ten days after the Request  Date to
attempt to resolve same. If such senior officers have been unable to  resolve
such Accounting Dispute within a period of 30 days after the Request  Date,
any party shall have the right, by written notice to the other specifying  in
reasonable detail the basis for the Accounting Dispute, to resolve the 
Accounting Dispute by submission thereof to Price Waterhouse Coopers or, if 
Price Waterhouse Coopers declines to accept the engagement contemplated
hereby,  a independent public accounting firm mutually agreeable to the
Parties, (Price  Waterhouse Coopers or such other agreed upon firm, the "
**Accounting  Referee** ").  The  scope of the Accounting Referee\'s
engagement shall be limited to the resolution  of the items described in the
notice of the Accounting Dispute given in  accordance with the foregoing and

the Accounting  Dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in light of the
circumstances but  in  no event in excess of 15 days following the
submission of the Accounting Dispute  to the Accounting Referee. The decision
and award of the Accounting Referee  shall be binding upon the parties as an
award under the Federal Arbitration  Act  and final and nonappealable to the
maximum extent permitted by law, and judgment  thereon may be entered in a
court of competent jurisdiction and enforced by  any  party as a final
judgment of such court. The fees and expenses of the Accounting  Referee
shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.

execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer or the consummation of 
the  transactions contemplated hereby by Buyer.

 

 

**Section  5.7.** **_Knowledgeable  Purchaser._ **Buyer  is  a
knowledgeable purchaser, owner and operator of oil and gas properties, has 
the  ability to evaluate (and in fact has evaluated) the Properties for
purchase.  Buyer is an "accredited investor," as defined in Regulation D
promulgated  pursuant to the Securities Act, and is acquiring the Properties
for its own  account and not with the intent to make a distribution within
the meaning of  the  Securities Act (and the rules and regulations
pertaining thereto) or a  distribution thereof in violation of any other
applicable securities laws.  Buyer  has had access to the Properties, the
officers and consultants of Seller, and  the books, records, and files of
Seller relating to the Properties. In making  the decision to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby, Buyer has
relied on its own independent due diligence  investigation of the Properties
and has been advised by and has relied solely  on  its own expertise and
legal, land, tax, reservoir engineering, and other  professional counsel
concerning this transaction, the Properties and the value  thereof.

 

 

**Section  5.8.** **_Funds._** **** Buyer  has, and at the Closing will
have, sufficient cash and other sources of  immediately available funds, as
are necessary in order to pay the Adjusted  Purchase Price to Seller at the
Closing and otherwise consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

**Section  5.9.** **_Fees  and Commissions._ **No  broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to  any  broker\'s,
finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission  in 
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon 
arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer.

 

 

**ARTICLE  VI**

 

**_Certain  Covenants of Seller Pending Closing_**

 

 

**Section  6.1.** **_Access  to Files._ **Subject  to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Article  IX_ ,  from  the date hereof until
Closing, Seller will give Buyer, and its attorneys,  accountants, and other
authorized representatives, access at all reasonable  times to the Properties
and to any contract files, lease or other title files,  production files,
well files and other files of Seller pertaining to the  ownership or
operation of the Properties, and Seller will use its Reasonable  Best Efforts
to arrange for Buyer, and its attorneys, accountants, and other 
representatives, to have access to any such files in the office of Seller
and  to  assist Buyer in obtaining the financial data necessary to prepare
its required  filings with the SEC.

 

 

**Section  6.2.** **_Conduct  of Operations._** **** From  the  date
hereof until Closing, Seller will (i) continue the routine operation  of the
Properties in the ordinary course of business; and (ii) operate the 
Properties in compliance with all Applicable Laws and Environmental Laws and 
in  compliance with all Basic Documents. Without expanding any obligations
that  Seller may have to Buyer, it is expressly agreed that Seller shall
never have  any liability to Buyer which respect to operation of a Property
greater than  that which it might have as the operator to a non-operator
under the standard  of  care (including any exculpatory clauses) contained
in the applicable operating  agreement (or, in the absence of such an
agreement, under the AAPL 610 (1989  Revision) form Operating Agreement)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-13-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Section  6.3.** **_Restrictions  on Certain Actions._ **From  the  date
hereof until Closing, except as set forth in Seller\'s development plan 
attached as Section 6.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller will not, 
without Buyer\'s prior consent in connection with the Properties:

 

 

(a) expend  any funds, or make any commitments to expend funds (including
entering into  new  agreements which would obligate Seller to expend funds),
or otherwise incur  any  other obligations or liabilities, other than to pay
expenses or to incur  liabilities in connection with routine operation of the
Properties after the  Effective Date and except in the event of an emergency
requiring immediate  action to protect life or preserve the Properties;

 

 

(b) except  where necessary to prevent the termination of a Lease or other
material  agreement governing Seller\'s interest in the Properties, propose
the drilling  of  any additional wells, or propose the deepening, plugging
back or reworking  of  any existing wells, or propose the conducting of any
other operations which  require consent under the applicable operating
agreement, or propose the  conducting of any other operations other than the
normal operation of the  existing wells on the Oil and Gas Properties, or
propose the abandonment of  any  wells on the Oil and Gas Properties (and
Seller agrees that it will advise  Buyer  of any such proposals made by
third parties and will respond to each such  proposal made by a third party
in the manner requested by Buyer);

 

 

(c) sell,  transfer or abandon any portion of the Properties other than items
of materials,  supplies, machinery, equipment, improvements or other personal
property or  fixtures forming a part of the Properties (and then only if the
same is replaced  with an item of substantially equal suitability, free of
liens and security  interests, which replacement item will then, for the
purposes of this Agreement,  become part of the Properties); or

 

 

(d) release  (or permit to terminate), or modify or reduce its rights under,
any oil, gas  or  mineral lease forming a part of the Oil and Gas
Properties, or any other Basic  Document, or enter into any new agreements
which would be Basic Documents,  or  modify any existing production sales
contracts or enter into any new production  sales contracts, except contracts
terminable by Seller with notice of 60 days  or  less.

 

 

**Section  6.4.** **_Payment  of Expenses._ **Seller  will cause all
expenses (including all bills for labor, materials and supplies  used or
furnished for use in connection with the Properties and all severance, 
production, and similar Taxes) relating to the ownership or operation of the 
Properties prior to the date of Closing to be promptly paid and discharged, 
except for expenses disputed in good faith.

 

 

**Section  6.5.** **_Preferential  Rights and Third Party Consents._
**Seller  will request, from the appropriate parties (and in accordance with
the documents  creating such rights or requirements), waivers of the
preferential rights to  purchase, or requirements that consent to assignment
be obtained, which are  identified in Section 6.5 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule. Seller shall  have no obligation hereunder other than to so request
such waivers ( _i.e._ ,  Seller  shall have no obligation to assure that
such waivers are obtained), and if  all  such waivers (or any other waivers
of preferential rights to purchase or  requirements that consent be obtained
to assignment, even if the same are not  listed on such Section 6.5) are not
obtained, Buyer may treat any waiver  which is not obtained as a matter which
causes Seller\'s title to not be  sufficient to meet the standards set forth
in _Article VIII_  (exclusive of the requirements that a Title Defect must
have a Title Defect  Amount attributable thereto in excess of $15,000 and
that the aggregate of  the  Title Defect Amounts exceeds one percent of the
Purchase Price); provided,  however, that if the unobtained waiver is a
waiver of a preferential right  to  purchase, and if both Buyer and Seller
agree to this treatment of such matter  (and agree upon an appropriate
allocation of the Purchase Price), Seller will  tender (at the agreed
allocated portion of the Purchase Price) the required  interest in the
Property affected by such unwaived preferential right to  purchase to the
holder, or holders, of such right who have elected not to waive  such
preferential right to purchase, and if, and to the extent that, such 
preferential right to purchase is exercised by such party or parties, such 
interest in such Property will be excluded from the transaction contemplated 
hereby and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the amount paid, or to be 
paid,  by the party exercising such preferential right to purchase (and
Seller shall  collect such amount from such purchaser).

shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to cause Buyer to be named as an 
additional insured during the period between the Effective Date and the
Closing  Date on all of its liability insurance policies covering the
Properties. In  the  event of damage by fire or other casualty to the

Agreement shall remain in full force  and effect, and (unless Buyer and
Seller shall otherwise agree) in such  event:

 

 

(a) as  to  each such Property so damaged which is an Oil and Gas Property,
then, at Buyer\'s  election, either (i) such Property shall be treated as if
it had an  asserted Title Defect associated with it and the procedure
provided for in  _Article VIII_  shall be  applicable thereto, or (ii) the

7.9_   for the  six-year period commencing on the Closing Date.

 

 

**Section  7.11. ****_Suspended  Funds._** On  or  prior to Closing,
Seller shall provide to Buyer a listing showing all proceeds  from production
attributable to the wells which are currently held in suspense  by Seller
(the " **Suspended  Proceeds** ").  With  respect to those Properties for
which Buyer will become successor operator  on  the Closing Date, Seller
shall transfer to Buyer all Suspended Proceeds  attributable thereto at
Closing. With respect to those Properties for which  Buyer becomes successor
operator after the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer  to Buyer all
Suspended Proceeds attributable thereto on the succession date  or  as soon
as reasonably practicable after such date. Upon receipt of Suspended

entitled to them to the extent and only to the extent of such  Suspended
Proceeds.

similar documentation) in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer and  Seller.

satisfactory  to  the counterparty and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) of
all Liens existing  on  collateral pledged by Seller as security under the
Existing Hedges.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-17-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Subject  to the provisions of this _Section  7.14(b)_ ,  Seller 
covenants and agrees that, upon written request from Buyer during the period 
commencing the date hereof and expiring five Business Days prior to the
Closing  Date (the " **Buyer** **Hedge  Period** "),  Seller will enter
into one or more Hedges on terms and with counterparties  determined by Buyer
with respect to a percentage of Seller\'s forecast production  from proved
producing oil and gas reserves attributable to the Properties as  determined
by Buyer. In connection with the foregoing, Buyer will give  reasonable
advance notice to Seller of any Hedge request made under this  _Section
7.14(b)_  during  the Buyer Hedge Period, and the parties agree to cooperate
and act in good  faith  in documenting and effecting such Hedge. Buyer
agrees to pay promptly all fees,  costs and expenses incurred by Seller or
its Affiliates in performing its  obligations under this _Section 7.14(b)_. 
Further, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates, 
and  its and their respective officers, partners, employees and agents from
and  against any claims, losses, damages, suits, proceedings, fees, costs
and  expenses (including attorneys\', consultants\' and experts\' fees and
expenses)  incurred by Seller in connection with any Hedge effected pursuant
to this  _Section  7.14(b)_ ,  including the costs of terminating such
Hedge in the event that the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement are
not consummated for any reason.

following the Closing, at the request of any party hereto and without 
further consideration, the other party or parties hereto shall execute and 
deliver to such requesting party such instruments and documents and take
such  other action (but without incurring any material financial obligation)
as such  requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate more
fully and  effectively the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

**ARTICLE  VIII**

 

**_Due  Diligence Examination_**

 

 

**Section  8.1.** **_Title  Due Diligence Examination._**

 

 

(a) From  the  date of this Agreement until 5:00 p.m. (local time in
Houston, Texas) five  Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the  "
**Examination  Period** "),  Seller  shall afford to Buyer and its
authorized representatives reasonable access  during normal business hours to
the office, personnel and books and records  of  Seller in  order  for
Buyer to conduct a title examination as it may in its sole discretion choose 
to conduct with respect to the Oil and Gas Properties in order to determine 
whether Title Defects (as defined below) exist (" **Buyer\'s  Title Review**
").  Such  books and records shall include all abstracts of title, title
opinions, title  files, ownership maps, lease files, assignments, division
orders, operating  records and agreements, well files, financial and
accounting records,  geological, geophysical and engineering records, in each
case insofar as same  may now be in existence and in the possession of
Seller,  excluding, however, any information that Seller is prohibited from
disclosing  by  bona fide, third party confidentiality restrictions;
provided, that if requested  by Buyer, Seller shall use its Reasonable Best
Efforts to obtain a waiver of  any  such restrictions in favor of Buyer. The
cost and expense of Buyer\'s Title  Review, if any, shall be borne solely by
Buyer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-18-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) If  Buyer  discovers any Title Defect affecting any of the Oil and Gas
Properties, Buyer  shall notify Seller prior to the expiration of the
Examination Period of such  alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such
notice (" **Title  Defect Notice** ")  must  (i) be in writing, (ii) be
received by Seller prior to the expiration  of the Examination Period, (iii)
describe the Title Defect in reasonable  detail (including any alleged
variance in the Net Revenue Interest),  (iv) identify the specific Oil and
Gas Property affected by such Title  Defect, and (v) include the value of
such Title Defect as determined by  Buyer in good faith. Any matters that may
otherwise constitute Title Defects,  but of which Seller has not been
specifically notified by Buyer in accordance  with the foregoing, shall be
deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all  purposes. Upon the receipt of
such effective Title Defect Notice from Buyer,  Seller shall have the option,
in addition to the remedies set forth in  _Section 8.1(c)_  (the  "
**Remedies  for Title Defects** "),  but  not the obligation, to attempt to
cure such Title Defect at any time prior  to  the Closing. The Oil and Gas
Property affected by such uncured Title Defect  shall be a " **Title  Defect
Property** ".

 

 

(c) With  respect to each Title Defect that is not cured on or before the
Closing, the  Purchase Price shall be reduced, subject to this _Article
VIII,_  by the  Title Defect Amount with respect to such Title Defect
Property. The  " **Title  Defect Amount** "  shall  mean, with respect to
a Title Defect Property, the amount by which such Title  Defect Property is
impaired as a result of the existence of one or more Title  Defects, which
amount shall be determined as follows:

 

 

(i) The  Title  Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined by  taking into consideration the " **Allocated  Value** " 
(as set  forth in _Exhibit 8.1(c)_  attached  hereto) of the Oil and Gas
Property subject to such Title Defect, the portion  of  the Oil and Gas
Property subject to such Title Defect, and the legal effect  of  such Title
Defect on the Oil and Gas Property affected thereby; provided,  however,
that: (A) if such Title Defect is in the nature of Seller\'s Net  Revenue
Interest in an Oil and Gas Property being less than the Net Revenue  Interest
set forth in _Exhibit 8.1(c)_  hereto  and the Working Interest remains the
same, then the Title Defect Amount shall  equal the Allocated Value for the
relevant Oil and Gas Property multiplied  by  the percentage reduction in
such Net Revenue Interest as a result of such Title  Defect or (B) if such
Title Defect is in the nature of a Lien, then the  Title Defect Amount shall
equal the amount required to fully discharge such  Lien; and

 

 

(ii) If  the  Title Defect results from any matter not described in _Section
8.1(c)(i)_,  the  Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the
difference between the  value  of the Title Defect Property affected by such
Title Defect with such Title  Defect and the value of such Title Defect
Property without such Title Defect  (taking into account the portion of the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect  Property).

 

 

(d) As  used  in this _Section 8.1_:

 

 

(i) " **Defensible  Title** "  means,  as of  the date  of this Agreement
and  the  Closing Date (and the period in between), with respect to the Oil
and Gas  Properties, such record title  and  ownership by Seller that:

 

 

(A) entitles  Seller to receive and retain, without reduction, suspension or
termination,  not  less than the percentage set forth in _Exhibit 8.1(c)_ 
as  Seller\'s Net Revenue Interest of all Hydrocarbons produced, saved and
marketed  from each Lease comprising such Oil and Gas Property as set forth
in  _Exhibit 8.1(c)_,  through  plugging, abandonment and salvage of all
wells comprising or included in such  Oil and Gas Property, and except for
changes or adjustments that result from  the  establishment of units,
changes in existing units (or the participating areas  therein), or the entry
into of pooling or unitization agreements after the  date  hereof unless
made in breach of the provisions of _Section 6.3_;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-19-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B) obligates  Seller to bear not greater than the percentage set forth in
_Exhibit 8.1(c)_  as  Seller\'s Working Interest of the costs and expenses
relating to the maintenance,  development and operation of each Lease
comprising such Oil and Gas  Property,  through  plugging, abandonment and
salvage of all wells comprising or included in such  Oil and Gas Property,
and except for changes or adjustments that result from  the  establishment
of units, changes in existing units (or the participating areas  therein), or
the entry into of pooling or unitization agreements after the  date  hereof
unless made in breach of the provisions of Section 6.3;

 

 

(C) is  free  and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Encumbrances;

 

 

(D) reflects  that all consents to assignment, notices of assignment or
preferential purchase  rights which are applicable to or must be complied
with in connection with  the  transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or
any prior sale, assignment or  the  transfer of such Oil and Gas Property,
have been obtained and complied with  to  the extent the failure to obtain
or comply with the same could render this  transaction or any such sale,
assignment or transfer (or any right or interest  affected thereby) void or
voidable or could result in Buyer or Seller incurring  any liability.

 

 

(ii) " **Permitted  Encumbrances** "  shall  mean (A) Liens for Taxes which
are not yet delinquent or which are being  contested in good faith and for
which adequate reserves have been established;  (B) normal and customary
Liens of co-owners under operating agreements,  unitization agreements, and
pooling orders relating to the Oil and Gas  Properties, which obligations are
not yet due and pursuant to which Seller  is  not in default; (C)
mechanic\'s and materialman\'s Liens relating to the Oil  and Gas Properties,
which obligations are not yet due and pursuant to which  Seller is not in
default; (D) Liens in the ordinary course of business  consisting of minor
defects and irregularities in title or other restrictions  (whether created
by or arising out of joint operating agreements, farm-out  agreements, leases
and assignments, contracts for purchases of Hydrocarbons  or  similar
agreements, or otherwise in the ordinary course of business) that are  of 
the nature customarily accepted by prudent purchasers of oil and gas
properties  and do not decrease  the Net Revenue Interest, increase the
Working Interest (without a proportionate  increase in the Net Revenue
Interest) or materially  affect the value of any property encumbered thereby;
(E) all approvals  required to be obtained from Governmental Entities that
are lessors under Leases  forming a part of the Oil and Gas Properties (or
who administer such Leases  on  behalf of such lessors) which are
customarily obtained post-closing;  (F) preferential rights to purchase and
consent to transfer requirements of  any Person (to  the  extent same 
have  been complied with in connection with the prior sale, assignment or the
transfer  of such Oil and Gas Property and are not  triggered by the
consummation of the transactions contemplated  herein);  (G) Liens  under
the Senior Credit Facility  (provided such Liens are released at Closing);
(H) Liens under the Existing  Hedges (provided such Liens are released at
Closing); and (I) conventional  rights of reassignment normally actuated by
an intent to abandon or release  a  lease and requiring notice to the
holders of  such  rights.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-20-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) " **Title  Defect** "  shall  mean any particular defect in or
failure of Seller\'s ownership of any Property:  (A) that causes Seller to
not have Defensible Title to such Oil and Gas  Property, (B) that has
attributable thereto a Title Defect Amount in excess  of  $15,000 and (C)
regarding which a Title Defect Notice has been timely and  otherwise validly
delivered. Notwithstanding any other provision in this  Agreement to the
contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and  shall  not be
asserted as, a Title Defect: (A) defects or irregularities arising  out of
lack of corporate authorization  unless  Buyer has a bona fide, independent
reason to believe that such lack of corporate  authorization will result in a
claim against Buyer\'s title; (B) defects or  irregularities that have been
cured or remedied by the applicable  statutes of limitation or statutes for
prescription; (C) defects or  irregularities in the chain of title consisting
of the failure to recite marital  status in documents or omissions of
heirship Proceedings;  (D) minor defects or irregularities in title which for
a period of five  years or more have not delayed or prevented Seller (or
Seller\'s predecessor)  from receiving its Net Revenue Interest share of the
proceeds of production  and  have not caused Seller to bear a share of
expenses and costs greater than its  Working Interest share from each Lease,
unit or Well; and  (E) defects or irregularities resulting  from or related
to probate Proceedings or the lack thereof which defects or  irregularities
have been outstanding for five years or more.

 

 

(e) If  Seller  and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to whether a
Title Defect exists  or, if it does exist, the Title Defect Amount
attributable such Title Defect,  the provisions of _Section 8.3_  shall be 
applicable.

 

 

**Section  8.2.** **_Environmental  Due Diligence Examination._**

 

 

(a) Buyer  shall have the right, or the right to cause an environmental
consultant  reasonably acceptable to Seller (" **Buyer\'s  Environmental
Consultant** "),  to  conduct a Phase I environmental assessment of the
Properties and to conduct  any  further Phase I or other non-invasive
environmental assessment of the Properties  it deems appropriate, to the
extent Seller has the authority to grant such  right  to Buyer. ("
**Buyer\'s  Environmental Review** ").  No  less than three Business Days
prior to the proposed commencement date of Buyer\'s  Environmental Review,
Buyer shall furnish Seller with an outline of the proposed  scope of such
review, including the locations of such activities. The cost  and  expense
of Buyer\'s Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer.  No
Person, other than Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant and Buyer\'s employees 
may  conduct Buyer\'s Environmental Review. Seller shall have the right to
have  representatives thereof present to observe Buyer\'s Environmental
Review  conducted in Seller\'s offices or on Seller\'s properties. Buyer
agrees to conduct  Buyer\'s Environmental Review in a manner so as not to
unduly interfere with  the  business operations of Seller and in compliance
with all Applicable Laws, and  Buyer shall exercise due care with respect to
Seller\'s properties and their  condition.

(b) Prior  to  the Closing, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law,
Buyer shall (and  shall  cause Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if
applicable, to) treat confidentially  any matters revealed by Buyer\'s
Environmental Review and any reports or data  generated from such review (the
" **Environmental  Information** "),  and  Buyer shall not (and shall cause
Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if  applicable, to not) disclose any
Environmental Information to any Governmental  Entity or other third party
without the prior written consent of Seller, unless  so required by
Applicable Law). Prior to the Closing, unless otherwise required  by
Applicable Law, Buyer may use the Environmental Information only in 
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Buyer, 
Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable, or any third party to whom 
Buyer has provided any Environmental Information become legally compelled to 
disclose any of the Environmental Information, Buyer shall provide Seller
with  prompt notice and Seller, at Seller\'s expense, may file any protective
order,  or  seek any other remedy, as it deems appropriate under the
circumstances. If  this  Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall deliver the  Environmental Information to Seller, which Environmental
Information shall  become the sole property of Seller. Upon Seller\'s written
request to Buyer,  Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental
Information to Seller without  charge.

 

 

(c) If  Buyer  or Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant, if applicable,
discovers any Environmental  Defect (as herein defined) prior to the
expiration of the Examination Period,  Buyer shall notify Seller prior to the
expiration of the Examination  Period **** of  such  alleged Environmental
Defect. To be effective, such notice (an " **Environmental  Defect Notice**
")  must  (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by Seller prior to the
expiration  of the Examination Period; (iii) describe the Environmental
Defect in  reasonable detail, including (A) the specific Properties affected
by or  associated with such Environmental Defect, (B) if applicable, a site
plan  showing the location of all field notes and the field conditions
observed,  (C) the written conclusion of Buyer\'s Environmental Consultant,
if  applicable, that an Environmental Defect is believed to exist, which
conclusion  shall be reasonably substantiated by the factual data gathered in
Buyer\'s  Environmental Review, and (D) if feasible and applicable, a
separate,  reasonably specific citation of the provisions of the
Environmental Laws alleged  to be violated and the related facts that
substantiate such violation; (iv)  describe the procedures recommended to
correct, eliminate or pay the  Environmental Defect, together with any
related recommendations from Buyer\'s  Environmental Consultant, if
applicable; and (v) set forth Buyer\'s good  faith estimate of the
Environmental Defect Value, including the basis for such  estimate. Any
matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects,  but  of which
Seller has not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with  the
foregoing, together with any environmental matter that does not constitute 
an Environmental Defect, shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for 
purposes of this _Section 8.2_.  Upon  the receipt of such effective notice
from Buyer, Seller shall have the option,  in addition to the remedy set
forth in _Section 8.4(c)_,  but not  the obligation, to attempt to cure such
Environmental Defect at any time prior  to the Closing, at the sole cost and
expense of Seller. If Seller and Buyer  are  unable to reach an agreement as
to whether an Environmental Defect exists or,  if  it does exist, the amount
of the Environmental Defect Value attributable  thereto, the provisions of
_Section 8.3_  shall be  applicable.

 

 

(d) If  any  Environmental Defect described in a notice delivered in
accordance with  _Section 8.2_  is not  cured on or before the Closing,
then the Purchase Price shall be reduced,  subject to _Section  8.4_ ,  by
the  Environmental Defect Value of such Environmental Defect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-22-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) As  used  in this _Section 8.2_:

 

 

(i) " **Environmental  Defect** "  shall  mean, with respect to any given
Property,  a violation of Environmental Laws in effect as of the date hereof
in the  jurisdiction in which such Property is located, an obligation under 
Environmental Laws to complete immediately or promptly after the Closing any 
corrective action at the Property, or any Environmental Liability arising
from  or attributable to any condition, event, circumstance, activity,
practice,  incident, action, or omission existing or occurring prior to the
Closing Date,  or the use, release, storage, treatment, transportation, or
disposal of  Hazardous Materials prior to the Closing Date, (A) regarding 
which an Environmental Defect Notice has been timely and otherwise validly 
delivered, (B) that has an Environmental Defect Value attributable thereto 
in excess of $50,000, and (C) is not otherwise disclosed in the Executive 
Summary included with that certain report of White Buffalo Environmental 
Services dated as of December 13, 2005, a copy of which has heretofore been 
provided by Seller to Buyer.

 

 

(ii) " **Environmental  Defect Value** "  shall  mean, (A) the  net
present value of the reasonably estimated costs and expenses to correct 
such  Environmental Defect in the most cost effective manner reasonably
available,  consistent with Environmental Laws, or (B) the net present value
of the  amount of Environmental Liabilities reasonably believed will be
incurred or  required to be paid by Seller with respect thereto. The parties
recognize that  the calculation of an Environmental Defect Value may require
the use of  assumptions and extrapolations; however, it is acknowledged and
agreed that  any  such assumptions and extrapolations will be consistent
with the known factual  information and reasonable in nature.

**Section  8.3. _Disputes  Regarding Title Defects or Environmental
Defects._** If  Seller  and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement as to
whether a Title Defect or  an  Environmental Defect exists, or if it does
exist, the Title Defect Amount or  Environmental Defect Value attributable to
such Title Defect or Environmental  Defect, or disputes relating to Post-
Closing Defects pursuant to _Section  8.4(c)_   (a  " **Defect  Dispute**
"),  each  party shall have the right to submit a Defect Dispute to an
independent expert  (the " **Independent  Expert** "),  who  shall serve
as sole arbitrator. The Independent Expert shall be appointed by  mutual
agreement of Seller and Buyer from among candidates (including lawyers)  with
experience and expertise in the area that is the subject of such Defect 
Dispute, and failing such agreement, such Independent Expert for such Defect 
Dispute shall be selected in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules  of  the AAA (the " **Rules** ").  Defect Disputes to be resolved by
an Independent Expert shall be resolved in  accordance with mutually agreed
procedures and rules and failing such agreement,  in accordance with the
Rules. The Independent Expert shall be instructed by  the  parties to
resolve such Defect Dispute as soon as reasonably practicable in  light of
the circumstances. The decision and award of the Independent Expert  shall be
binding upon the parties as an award under the Federal Arbitration  Act  and
final and nonappealable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and judgment 
thereon may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction and enforced by 
any  party as a final judgment of such court.

 

 

**Section  8.4.** **_Adjustments  to Purchase Price for Defects._**

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
adjustment of the  Purchase Price shall be made for Title Defects unless the
aggregate of the  Title  Defect Amounts, as determined in accordance with
this Agreement, equals or  exceeds one percent of the Purchase Price, in
which event the Purchase Price  shall be adjusted downward by the amount such
Title Defect Amounts exceed one  percent of the Purchase Price in the
aggregate.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
adjustment of the  Purchase Price shall be made for Environmental Defects
unless the aggregate  of  the Environmental Defect Values, as determined in
accordance with this  Agreement, equals or exceeds one percent of the
Purchase Price, in which event  the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward
by the amount such Environmental  Defect Values exceed one percent of the
Purchase Price in the  aggregate.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, if Seller is unable to
cure a Title Defect  or  an Environmental Defect (a " **Post-Closing 
Defect** ")  on or  prior to Closing, Seller shall have the option, by
notice in writing to Buyer  on  or before Closing, to attempt to cure such
Post-Closing Defect within the 90-day  period commencing the Closing Date
(the " **Cure  Period** ").  In  such  event, the transactions
contemplated hereby will close as provided herein,  but  an amount equal to
the applicable Title Defect Amount or Environmental Defect  Value to which
the Post-Closing Defect pertains shall be deducted from the  Adjusted
Purchase Price otherwise payable at Closing and paid into the Joint  Account.
The amount deposited into the Joint Account with respect to a  Post-Closing
Defect will remain therein until released as provided in  _Section 8.4(d)_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-24-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Buyer  will act in good faith and reasonably cooperate with the Seller
after the  Closing to cure a Post-Closing Defect (provided, that Buyer shall
not be  required to expend any monies in connection therewith and Seller
shall conduct  its curative activities in a manner so as to not unreasonably
interfere with  Buyer\'s operations). If Seller and Buyer mutually agree that
a Post-Closing  Defect has been cured, then within two Business Days after
such determination,  the amount withheld in the Joint Account with respect
thereto (together with  any  interest earned thereon) shall be released to
Seller. If Seller and Buyer  mutually agree that a Post-Closing Defect has
been partially cured, then Seller  and Buyer shall mutually determine the
portion of the amount retained in the  Joint Account with respect thereto
(together with any interest earned thereon)  that should be paid to Buyer to
compensate it for the uncured portion thereof  (together with interest earned
thereon), and the remaining portion of such  amount shall be released to
Seller (together with any interest earned thereon).  If Seller and Buyer
mutually agree that a Post-Closing Defect has not been  cured, then within
two Business Days after such determination, the amount  withheld in the Joint
Account with respect thereto (together with any interest  earned thereon)
shall be released to Buyer. If, at the end of the Cure Period,  Seller has
been unable to cure a Post-Closing Defect (and there is no dispute  as  to
whether or not it has been cured), the amount withheld in the Joint Account 
with respect thereto (together with any interest earned thereon) shall be 
released to Buyer. If, at the end of the Cure Period, Seller and Buyer are 
unable to agree whether there has been a satisfactory resolution of a  Post-
Closing Defect, then such disagreement shall be resolved as provided in 
_Section 8.3_.

 

 

**Section  8.5.** **_Buyer  Indemnification._ ****BUYER  HEREBY INDEMNIFIES
AND SHALL DEFEND AND HOLD SELLER, AFFILIATES THEREOF, AND  ITS  AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE OWNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,  REPRESENTATIVES,

would  be liable to the another party under _Section 11.2_ or  _Section
11.3_ (an " **Indemnified  Party** ")  is  asserted against or sought to be
collected from an Indemnified Party by a third  party, the Indemnified Party
shall with reasonable promptness notify the  Indemnifying Party of such claim
or demand, but the failure so to notify the  Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations  under this _Article XI_,
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party  demonstrates that the defense of
such claim or demand is materially prejudiced  thereby. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 days from receipt of the above  notice from the
Indemnified Party (in this _Section 11.5_, the "Notice  Period") to notify
the Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party  desires, at the
Indemnifying Party\'s sole cost and expense, to defend the  Indemnified Party
against such claim or demand; provided, that the Indemnified  Party is hereby
authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any  motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate  to  protect
its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and not prejudicial  to 
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the
defense  of any such claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to  employ separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in
the defense  thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the
defense of such  claim or demand (or fails to give notice to the Indemnified
Party during the  Notice Period), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume the defense  of  such claim or demand with counsel of its own choice,
at the expense of the  Indemnifying Party. If the claim or demand is asserted
against both the  Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and based on
the advice of counsel  reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party it
is determined that there  is  a conflict of interest which renders it
inappropriate for the same counsel  to  represent both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, the  Indemnifying Party shall be responsible
for paying separate counsel for the  Indemnified Party; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not  be  responsible for paying for more
than one separate firm of attorneys to represent  all of the Indemnified
Parties, regardless of the number of Indemnified Parties.  If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such claim or demand,  (i)
no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by the Indemnifying 
Party without the Indemnified Party\'s written consent (which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages 
that  are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party  shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement
thereof  effected without its written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably  withheld).

contemplated by  this  Agreement.

ordinary, strict, sole, or  contributory negligence of such party and
regardless of whether any other party  (including the other parties to this
Agreement) is or is not also negligent;  provided, however, nothing herein is
intended or shall be construed as requiring  indemnification by one part for
the gross negligence or willful misconduct  of  the other party. The parties

not be entitled to receive any such disputed portion  thereof from the

resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement and,  if  such
dispute extends beyond the expiration of the Indemnification Support Term, 
the Indemnification Support Term will be automatically extended as provided 
in  _subsection  (d)_   below.

to the expiration of the Indemnification Support  Term  have been satisfied
and no dispute then exists as to any claim for  indemnification notified by
Buyer to Seller hereunder prior to the expiration  of  the Indemnification
Support Term, the remaining Indemnification Support Deposit  will be released
to Seller on the first Business Day immediately following  the  expiration
of the Indemnification Support Term. To the extent there exists  a  claim
for indemnification that has been notified by Buyer to Seller hereunder,  but
not satisfied in full in accordance herewith prior to the expiration of 
the  Indemnification Support Term, an amount equal to the maximum possible
amount  of  such claim or claims reasonably believed to be due or likely to
be due hereunder  by the parties hereto (or, in the event of a dispute
between the parties with  respect thereto, the higher of the two estimates)
will be withheld from such  remaining Indemnification Support Deposit and
will continue to be held in the  Joint Account until such claim or claims
have been fully resolved.
