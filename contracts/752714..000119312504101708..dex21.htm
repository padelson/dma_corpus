3.4. _Adjustment of Payment in Respect of Purchase Price_. Promptly after (but
not later than five days after) the determination of the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 3.3_ that is final and binding as set forth therein:



(a) if the Purchase Price (as so determined) exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, US Buyer, on behalf of itself and as agent for Canadian Buyer, shall
pay to CIT Technologies, as agent for Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds an aggregate amount equal to the excess of (i) the Purchase
Price over (ii) the Estimated Purchase Price, plus interest on such excess
from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof at the Agreed Rate; or



 

(b) if the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Purchase Price (as so
determined), CIT Technologies, on behalf of itself and as agent for CIT
Canada, shall pay to US Buyer, as agent for Buyers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an aggregate amount equal to the excess of (i) the
Estimated Purchase Price over (ii) the Purchase Price, plus interest on such

Rate.



3.5.  _Allocation of Purchase Price_.



(a) The US Purchase Price (including, for purposes of this _Section 3.5(a)_ ,
any other consideration treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as being
paid to CIT Technologies, including any applicable liabilities assumed or
taken subject to) shall be allocated among the US Purchased Assets (and any
other assets, including the Covenant Not to Compete, that are considered to be
acquired by US Buyer for U.S. federal income tax purposes) in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code. CIT Technologies and US Buyer shall cooperate and
mutually agree on the determination of the US Purchase Price allocation (the "
_US Purchase Price Allocation_ "). CIT Technologies and US Buyer agree to (i)
be bound by the US Purchase Price Allocation, and (ii) act in accordance with
the US Purchase Price Allocation in the filing of all United States Tax
Returns (including filing IRS Form 8594 (and any supplemental or amended Form
8594) with their United States federal income Tax Return for the taxable year
that includes the Closing Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CIT
Technologies and US Buyer are unable



 

22 to agree to an allocation of the US Purchase Price within 90 days after the
determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.3_ that is final
and binding, as set forth therein, or by such later date as agreed to by CIT
Technologies and US Buyer, each of CIT Technologies and US Buyer may file IRS
Form 8594 (and any supplemental or amended Form 8594), and any United States
federal, state or local, or non-U.S. Tax Returns, allocating the US Purchase
Price among the US Purchased Assets (and any other assets referred to in the
first sentence of this _Section 3.5(a)_ ) in the manner each party believes
appropriate, provided such allocation is reasonable and in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. CIT
Technologies and US Buyer agree to provide the other party promptly with any
other information required to complete Form 8594, but only to the extent
required by the Code.



(b) The Canadian Purchase Price (including, for purposes of this _Section
3.5(b)_ , any other consideration treated for Canadian federal income tax
purposes as being paid to CIT Canada, including any applicable liabilities
assumed or taken subject to) shall be allocated among the Canadian Purchased
Assets (and any other assets that are considered to be given to or acquired by
Canadian Buyer for Canadian federal and provincial income tax purposes) on
a reasonable basis and in accordance with the Canadian Act and analogous
Canadian provincial law. CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer shall cooperate and
mutually agree on the determination of such allocation (the " _Canadian
Purchase Price Allocation_ "). CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer agree to (i) be
bound by the Canadian Purchase Price Allocation, and (ii) act in accordance
with the Canadian Purchase Price Allocation in the filing of all Canadian Tax
Returns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer are
unable to agree to the Canadian Purchase Price Allocation within 90 days after
the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.3_ that is
final and binding, as set forth therein, or by such later date as agreed to
by CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer, each of CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer may
file any Canadian federal, provincial or local or non-Canadian Tax Returns,
allocating the Canadian Purchase Price among the Canadian Purchased Assets
(and other assets referred to in the first sentence of this _Section 3.5(b)_ )
in the manner each party believes appropriate, provided such allocation is
reasonable and in accordance with the Canadian Act. CIT Canada and the
Canadian Buyer agree to duly make and file, within the time and in the manner
permitted by the relevant law, such elections or designations pursuant to
proposed paragraph 56.4(3)(b) of the Canadian Act (or any similar provision
which is enacted for the same purpose) and any analogous provision of
Canadian provincial law, as may be requested by CIT Canada in order that the
portion (if any) of the Canadian Purchase Price allocated to the Covenant Not
to Compete shall be treated under the Canadian Act and analogous provisions
of any Canadian provincial law, as an "eligible capital amount" for the
purposes of the Canadian Act.



(c) Sellers and Buyers shall cooperate and mutually agree on the determination
of the US Premium and the Canadian Premium subsequent to the Closing
Date; provided, that if the parties are unable to reach agreement within 30
days after the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.3_
that is final and binding, as set forth therein, or such later date as agreed
to by the parties, the US Premium shall be deemed to be the Premium
multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the US Purchase Price
that would be arrived at pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ if the US Premium were
zero, and (ii) the denominator of which is the excess of the Purchase Price
over the Premium. The Canadian Premium shall be the excess of the Premium over
the US Premium.

extent required. The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of
this Agreement and of each Seller Ancillary Agreement to which such Seller is
a party have been duly authorized and approved by the Board of Directors of
such Seller (or a duly authorized committee thereof) to the extent required.
No further authorization or consent of CIT, CIT Technologies or CIT Canada or

in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance upon any of the Purchased
Assets, under (A) the charter or by-laws of CIT or either Seller, (B) any

principles consistent with the books and records and past practices of
Sellers, except that the Balance Sheet Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet does not
contain footnotes and except as set forth in _Schedule 5.3(B)_.

Balance Sheet Date Pro Forma Balance Sheet, and will be reflected in
the Valuation Date Balance Sheet, as follows:



(i) until such time as the applicable purchase option for such equipment
becomes exercisable, such equipment is reflected at the net book value of such
equipment as of the date of origination of the related lease (determined by
depreciating the original acquisition cost of such equipment over its
original useful life) less accumulated straight line depreciation from the
date of origination of such lease to the date on which the applicable purchase
option is first exercisable, and



(ii) at all times after the applicable purchase option is exercisable, such
equipment is reflected at $1.00.



(c) The net book value of the ETR Fixed Buy-out Equipment and the MTM Fixed

(i) If the net book value of such equipment, determined by depreciating the
original acquisition cost of such equipment over the original useful life of
such equipment, is greater than or equal to the applicable purchase price
option for such equipment, then such equipment is reflected at the net book
value of such equipment at the date of origination of the related lease less
accumulated straight line depreciation from the date of origination to the
date on which the applicable purchase option is first exercisable (with the
amount depreciated being the excess of the net book value of such equipment
at the date of origination over the applicable purchase option amount).



(ii) If the net book value of such equipment, determined by depreciating the
original acquisition cost of such equipment over the original useful life of
such equipment, is less than the applicable purchase price option for such

(i) such Valuation Date Receivable is true, valid and genuine, arises from a
_bona_ _fide_ transaction in the ordinary course of Business and represents

thereof which materially impairs or materially adversely affects such

beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section 8.2(a)_ , any
Straddle Period shall be treated as two partial periods, one ending at the
close of business on the Closing Date and the other beginning after the
Closing Date, except that Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as (i)
personal property Taxes or (ii) real property Taxes, whether assessed directly
or passed through to either Buyer or either Seller as lessee under any of the
leases of Leased Real Property) shall be apportioned on a daily basis. In the
case of personal property Taxes, the Taxes that shall be treated as being
incurred in a Straddle Period and that shall be subject to apportionment on a
daily basis pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be such
Taxes as have a lien date that is (i) October 1 or December 31 of the calendar
year preceding the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, or (ii) on
or prior to the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs (the Taxes described in this sentence, " _Straddle Personal Property
Taxes_ "). Sellers shall be responsible for Straddle Personal Property Taxes
in an amount equal to such Taxes multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator
of which is the number of days in the period from the lien date through the
Closing Date, and (ii) the denominator of which is 365, and Buyers shall be
responsible for the remaining portion of Straddle Personal Property Taxes.
For the avoidance of doubt, (A) Sellers shall be responsible for any personal
property Tax relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets that has a lien
date that is in a calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs (except for the two days described in clause (i) of the
preceding sentence), and (B) Buyers shall be responsible for any personal
property Tax relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets that has a lien
date after the Closing Date.



(b) _Straddle Period_. If permitted by a Governmental Body, Buyers and
Sellers shall file separate Tax Returns for their respective portions of any
Straddle Period. If separate Tax Returns with respect to a Straddle Period are
not permitted by a Governmental Body, the party required to sign such Tax
Return shall be responsible for the preparation and



 

44 filing of such Tax Return. The party preparing a Straddle Period Tax Return
referred to in the preceding sentence shall provide the other party with a
draft of such Tax Return and consider any comments thereon that such other
party may timely provide.



(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding _Section 8.2(a)_ , (i) any sales Tax,
use Tax, transfer Tax, documentary stamp Tax, value-added Tax or similar Tax
(other than GST and QST and GST/QST Penalty and Interest Amounts) directly
attributable to the sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne one-half by Buyers and one-
half by Sellers, and (ii) Buyers and Sellers agree to timely sign and deliver
such valid exemption or other certificates or forms as Buyers or Sellers may
request and as may be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from
(or otherwise reduce), or make a report with respect to, Transfer Taxes. The
parties intend that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute
an isolated casual transaction that would qualify for any exemption from
Transfer Tax based on such status.



(d) _Personal Property Tax Reimbursements_. Where personal property Taxes
described in _Section 8.2(a)_ are imposed with respect to property subject to
Purchased Leases permitting the lessor to obtain reimbursement for such Taxes
from the Obligor, any reimbursement obtained by a Seller with respect to such
Taxes for which a Buyer is liable under _Section 8.2(a)_ shall promptly be
paid by such Seller to such Buyer, and any reimbursement obtained by a Buyer
with respect to such Taxes for which a Seller is liable under  _Section
8.2(a)_ , shall promptly be paid by such Buyer to such Seller. Following
Closing, upon request of a Seller, the applicable Buyer shall send to an
applicable Obligor a written request that such Obligor reimburse such Taxes
and shall take other action reasonably requested by such Seller to obtain
reimbursement for such Taxes.



(e) _Canadian GST and QST Elections_.



(i) At the Closing, CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer shall execute jointly an
election under Section 167 of the Excise Tax Act and its equivalent under
Section 75 of the Quebec Sales Tax Act to have the sale of the Canadian
Purchased Assets take place on a GST-free basis under Part IX of the Excise
Tax Act and QST-free basis under Quebec Sales Tax Act, respectively, and
Canadian Buyer shall file such elections with its GST and QST Tax Returns,
respectively, for the reporting period which includes the Closing Date.



(ii) Canadian Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless CIT Canada in respect of
any GST, QST and any penalties and interest (" _GST/QST Penalty and Interest
Amounts_ ") that may be assessed against CIT Canada under Part IX of the
Excise Tax Act or the Quebec Sales Tax Act in the event that the elections
referred to in _Section 8.2(e)(i)_ are determined by a Governmental Body to be
unavailable in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Canadian Buyer shall pay to CIT Canada any GST, QST, GST/QST Penalty and
Interest Amounts, and any additional income Taxes imposed upon CIT Canada as a
result of reimbursement under this _Section 8.2(e)(ii)_ , within 10
business days of receipt of notice from CIT Canada that the applicable amount
has been assessed. Canadian Buyer shall pay for all costs (including legal
costs) incurred in connection with any investigation, audit, challenge or
appeal in respect of any assessed GST, QST or GST/QST Penalty and Interest
Amounts for which the elections referred to in _Section 8.2(e)(i)_ had been
made.



 

45 (f) _Canadian Section 22 Election_. CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer agree to
duly make and file an election in prescribed form under Section 22 of the
Canadian Act (and analogous provisions of any other Canadian Tax law) to have
such provisions apply in respect of accounts receivable included in the
Canadian Purchased Assets. Each of CIT Canada and Canadian Buyer shall file
such election with its Tax Return for the Tax Period that includes the Closing
Date.



(g) _Canadian Bulk Sales Legislation_. Canadian Buyer shall not require CIT
Canada to comply with the requirements of the Bulk Sales Act (Ontario)
or Section 6 of Retail Sales Act (Ontario) or any other similar Canadian
laws. CIT Canada warrants and agrees to pay and discharge when due all claims
of creditors asserted against Canadian Buyer by reason of such non-compliance
to the extent that such liabilities are not specifically assumed by Canadian
Buyer as a Canadian Assumed Obligation. CIT Canada hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold Canadian Buyer harmless from, against and in respect of any Loss or
Expense suffered or incurred by Canadian Buyer or claims of any Governmental
Body in respect of Taxes by reason of any failure of CIT Canada to pay or
discharge any such claim.



(h) _Reimbursement_. Each party hereto shall provide reimbursement for any Tax
which is the responsibility of such party in accordance with the terms of
this Section 8.2 and which is paid by any other party hereto. Within a
reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Tax, the party or parties
paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party or parties of the Tax
payable and the portion which is the liability of each party, although
failure to do so will not relieve the other party from its liability
hereunder.



(i) _Notice of Tax Claims_.



(i) If a claim shall be made by any Governmental Body with respect to Taxes,
which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)_ or _Section 11.2_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party
shall promptly, as practicable following the receipt of such Tax Claim, give
written notice of such claim to the Indemnitor; _ provided_ , _however_ , the
failure of the Indemnified Party to give timely notice shall only relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its indemnification obligations hereunder to the
extent it is actually prejudiced by such failure.



(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall control all
proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel) at their own expense. Sellers and Buyers
shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim
relating to Taxes (other than income Taxes) for a Straddle Period. Buyers
shall control at their own expense all proceedings with respect to any Tax
Claim relating to a Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date. A party
shall promptly notify the other party if it decides not to control the defense
or settlement of any Tax Claim which it is entitled to control pursuant to
this Agreement, and the other party shall thereupon be permitted to defend
and settle such proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, _Sections 11.3_ and
_11.4_ shall not apply to any indemnification obligations relating to Taxes.



 

46 (j) _Tax Cooperation_.



(i) After the Closing, Sellers and Buyers shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to), (A) subject to _Section 8.2(i)_ , provide notice
to the other party in writing within 15 days of such partyÂ’s knowledge of any
pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the Business or
the Purchased Assets for taxable periods for which the other may have a
liability under this _Section 8.2_ , although failure to do so will not
relieve the other party from any liability hereunder; and (B) within 15 days
of receipt thereof, furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence
received from any taxing authority in connection with any such Tax audit or
information request with respect to any such taxable period, although failure
to do so will not relieve the other party from its liability hereunder.
Sellers shall have the sole right to control any Tax audit or administrative
or court proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, and to employ counsel of their choice at their expense.



(ii) After the Closing, Sellers and Buyers shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to):



(A) make available to the other party, as reasonably requested, all
information, records and documents necessary to perform any Tax calculations
(including in connection with any GST, PST or property Taxes) or to complete
any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for preparing and
filing;



(B) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing
authorities regarding, or any Tax Claims in connection with, any Tax Returns
relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets;



(C) make available to the other party and to any taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes
relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets, including making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to any such Tax Claim;



(D) in the case of Buyers, (1) allow Sellers to access the STAR and Vertex
Quantum computer programs included in the Purchased Assets and data files
related thereto, to the extent relating to the Business or the Purchased
Assets; (2) allow Sellers to access the Excel and Word-formatted files
containing accounting information relating to the Business or the Purchased
Assets; (3) provide Sellers with a copy of the output of (or other
information contained in) such programs and files as are referred to in the
foregoing clauses (1) and (2); and (4) provide Sellers with the assistance of
employees of Buyers trained in utilizing such programs; and



(E) timely provide to the other party powers of attorney or similar
authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this _Section 8.2_.



 

47 8.3. _Guaranty_.



(a) CIT does hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee (the
" _Guarantee_ ") to Buyers, and all of their successors and assigns, the full
and timely payment and performance by Sellers of all covenants, agreements,
terms, conditions, undertakings, indemnities and other obligations to be
performed and observed by Sellers under this Agreement and the Seller
Ancillary Agreements (the " _CIT Obligations_ "). CIT agrees that the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by CIT shall be conclusive evidence
against CIT that the CIT Obligations are unconditional, absolute
and irrevocable.



(b) The CIT Obligations constitute a present and continuing guarantee of
payment and not of collectability, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall
not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, deduction or defense based upon
any claim CIT, Buyer, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates may have
against each other or any other Person and shall remain in full force and
effect without regard to and shall not be released, discharged or in any way
affected or impaired by, any of the following (whether or not CIT shall have
any knowledge or notice thereof or consent thereto): (i) any amendment or
modification of or supplement to this Agreement; (ii) any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, composition,
liquidation or similar proceedings with respect to either Seller or any other
Person, or the properties or creditors of any of them and the disallowance of
any claim of Buyers in any such bankruptcy; (iii) any transfer or purported
transfer, any consolidation or merger of any of Buyers, CIT or Sellers with
or into any other corporation or entity, or any change whatsoever in the
objects, capital structure, constitution or business of any of Buyers, CIT or
Sellers; (iv) any failure on the part of either Seller to perform or
comply with any terms of this Agreement or any other document to be delivered
in connection therewith or (v) any assertions by either Buyer of any right it
may have under this Agreement, or any waiver of, failure to exercise or
forbearance in exercising any such right or remedy shall not release CIT from
its obligations under this Guarantee.



(c) The CIT Obligations shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated,
as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any obligations guaranteed
hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by a Buyer upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any assignee or any other Person,
all as though such payment had not been made.



(d) If CIT shall make any payment due in respect of this Agreement pursuant to
this Guarantee, it shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
be subrogated to the rights of Buyers in respect of which such payment was
made. CIT hereby agrees that the foregoing right of subrogation shall not be
effective until, and that it shall not be entitled to receive any payment,
under any condition, in respect of any such subrogated claim unless and until
a Seller (or CIT on its behalf) has fully performed all obligations hereunder
to be performed by any such party and all sums which may become due, or are
stated in this Agreement to become due, shall have become due and shall have
been paid in full or funds for their payment shall have been duly and
sufficiently provided.



(e) The CIT Obligations shall survive any expiration or termination of this
Agreement and shall apply to all future amendments of or modifications to
this Agreement.



 

48 (f) This Guarantee shall be binding upon CIT and its successors and shall
inure to the benefit of Buyer and its successors and assigns.



(g) This Guarantee may not be assigned by CIT and any purported assignment
shall be null and void.



8.4. _Employee Matters_.



(a) Sellers shall take all actions to ensure that SellersÂ’ or CITÂ’s
employment of each Business Employee (other than an Excepted Business Employee
or a Leave Employee) shall cease effective as of the Closing Date. Sellers
will ensure full and final payment of all compensation (including salary,
commissions and accrued bonuses) due and owing to such terminated employees as
of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date. Sellers or CIT
in their sole discretion shall determine whether SellersÂ’ or CITÂ’s employment
of Excepted Business Employees or Leave Employees shall continue on or after
the Closing Date. Except for up to ten Business Employees to be identified in
_Schedule 8.4(A)_ (such schedule to be delivered by US Buyer to Sellers at
least three business days prior to the Closing Date, " _Excepted Business
Employees_ "), US Buyer shall offer to all Business Employees employed by CIT
Technologies or CIT on the date of this Agreement and to all Business
Employees hired by CIT Technologies in the ordinary course after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, and Canadian Buyer shall offer
to all Business Employees employed by CIT Canada on the date of this
Agreement and to all Business Employees hired by CIT Canada in the ordinary
course after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date,
employment commencing immediately after Closing, at substantially similar
salaries and with substantially similar bonus opportunities as in effect as
of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement
shall create any obligation on the part of either Buyer to continue salary or
bonus levels after 2004 or to continue the employment of any Business
Employee for any period of time. With respect to a Leave Employee, a BuyerÂ’s
offer of employment shall be conditioned upon the Leave Employee commencing,
or returning to, active employment within 90 days of the Closing Date, unless
otherwise agreed upon by such Buyer and the Leave Employee. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, during the 180-day period beginning on the Closing Date, each
applicable Buyer shall provide severance pay (which, in the case of the
Business Employees of CIT Canada, shall include such pay in lieu of notice and
severance pay as is required by applicable law) to any Transferred Business
Employee whose employment with such Buyer is terminated for a reason that
would have entitled such employee to severance pay under the severance plan
maintained as of the date hereof by CIT Technologies (or, in the case of the
Business Employees of CIT Canada, in accordance with applicable law) if such
termination had occurred under like circumstances while such employee was
employed by such Seller or CIT. Any severance payable pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence shall be no less favorable to the Transferred
Business Employee to whom such severance is payable than if such severance
was paid under the severance plan maintained as of the date hereof by CIT
Technologies (or, in the case of the Business Employees of CIT Canada, in
accordance with applicable law). Sellers shall reimburse Buyers for the
amount of any severance paid pursuant to this _Section 8.4(a)_ , but not more
than (i) $2,000,000 _minus_ (ii) the Accrued Vacation Amount _minus_ (iii) any
severance (or pay in lieu of notice and severance pay as is required by
applicable law with respect to any Excepted Business Employee or Leave
Employee employed by CIT Canada) paid on or after the Closing Date by Sellers
to the Excepted Business Employees or the Leave Employees; _provided_ that
there shall be no

 



 

49 subtraction for severance payable to the President of Technology Rentals and
Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it hereby is agreed that nothing in
this Agreement constitutes an agreement by Buyers to adopt the terms of any
severance plan or plans maintained by Sellers, except as expressly provided in
this _Section 8.4(a)_.



(b) Sellers shall take all actions to ensure that all Business
Employees (other than Leave Employees and Excepted Business Employees) cease
participation in any Welfare Plan sponsored or maintained by CIT Technologies
or in any Canadian Benefit Plan and cease accruing benefits under any Pension
Plan sponsored or maintained by CIT Technologies, except as otherwise
required by the terms of any such Plan or Canadian Benefit Plan or applicable
Requirements of Law, as of the Closing Date.



(c) Commencing on the Closing Date, all Business Employees who become
employees of a Buyer (" _Transferred Business Employees_ ") shall be eligible
for those Plans and other employee benefits in effect for similarly situated
existing employees of Buyers. Each Plan or other material employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement maintained by Buyers for their existing
employees is listed in _Schedule 8.4(C)_. To the extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Laws, Buyers shall credit Transferred Business
Employees for their period of service recognized by Sellers and their
Affiliates for all employment and benefit purposes, including for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the Plans of Buyers (including under the McGrath
RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership Plan, but only if vesting credit for such
plan is approved by US BuyerÂ’s board of directors, and provided further, that
vesting credit under such plan for any Transferred Business Employee under no
circumstance shall exceed the maximum vesting credit that would be applicable,
as of the Closing Date, to an employee of US Buyer who enrolled in such plan
on the date when participation in such plan was first made available to US
BuyersÂ’ employees) and for purposes of any vacation, severance, deferred
compensation or supplemental income arrangements sponsored or maintained by
either Buyer. Subject to the approval of any insurance carrier and to the
extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Laws, Buyers shall (or shall
cause their designee or designees to) cause any and all pre-
existing condition (or actively-at-work or similar) limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Welfare
Plans maintained by Buyers to be waived with respect to Transferred Business
Employees and their eligible dependents, except to the extent that such
restrictions or requirements have not been satisfied under corresponding
Welfare Plans maintained by Sellers as of the Closing Date, and shall provide
Transferred Business Employees with credit for any co-payments, deductibles
and offsets (or similar payments) made prior to the Closing Date under the
Welfare Plans or Canadian Benefit Plans maintained by Sellers for purposes of
satisfying any applicable co-payments, deductibles and offsets (or similar
payments) under corresponding Welfare Plans or Canadian employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Buyers in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the provisions contained herein shall operate to duplicate any
employee benefit provided to any Transferred Business Employee or the funding
of any such benefit. It is understood that Buyers reserve the right and sole
discretion to change, modify, discontinue or terminate any or all of its
Welfare Plans at any time following the Closing Date to the extent permitted
by applicable law.



(d) US Buyer shall establish or make available flexible spending accounts for
medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan
established or maintained



 

50 under Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (" _US Buyer Â’s FSA_"),
effective as of the Closing Date, for each Transferred Business Employee who,
on or prior to the Closing Date, is a participant, and maintains a positive
account balance, in a flexible spending account for medical or dependent care
expenses under a Plan of CIT Technologies pursuant to Section 125 and Section
129 of the Code (" _CIT Technologies Â’ FSA_"). As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, CIT Technologies shall transfer cash
equal to the aggregate value of the positive account balances of the
Transferred Business Employees in CIT TechnologiesÂ’ FSA to US Buyer and, upon
receipt thereof, US Buyer shall credit, effective as of the Closing Date, the
applicable account of each such Transferred Business Employee under the US
BuyerÂ’s FSA with an amount equal to the positive balance of each such
Transferred Business EmployeeÂ’s account under the CIT TechnologiesÂ’ FSA on the
date immediately prior to the Closing Date.



(e) Any vacation days accrued by Transferred Business Employees from
January 1, 2004 through the Closing Date, but unused by such employees as of
the Closing Date, shall be transferred to and assumed by Buyers as of the
Closing Date, and Buyers shall recognize and provide all such unused paid
vacation.



(f) During SellersÂ’ or CITÂ’s employment of the Leave Employees, Sellers or
CIT shall have the liability and obligation for short-term disability, sick
pay or salary continuation benefits for such employees. Except with respect to
disabilities, illnesses or salary continuation events occurring on or after a
Leave EmployeeÂ’s commencement of active employment with a Buyer, Buyers shall
have no liability for or obligation relating to the provision of such
benefits.



(g) CIT Technologies and US Buyer shall permit Transferred Business Employees
who participate in the CIT Group, Inc. Savings Incentive Plan to make,
in their sole discretion, elective transfers of their entire account balances
thereunder to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by US
Buyer. Any such transfers shall be in accordance with section 411(d)(6)(D) of
the Code and QandA-3 of Treas. Reg. Â§1.411(d)-4. CIT Technologies and US Buyer
shall cooperate in providing Transferred Business Employees with written
notification of their right to make such transfers and shall take any other
actions necessary to effectuate such transfers, including, if necessary,
amending their respective plans to permit such transfers. Prior to, and as a
condition of, any elective transfer of assets, each party shall provide the
other with satisfactory evidence that its plan is tax-qualified within the
meaning of section 401(a) of the Code. As of the transfer date, US Buyer shall
be liable for the payment of benefits accrued by and transferred in respect of
the Transferred Business Employees who make elective transfers. 



(h) Sellers shall be solely responsible for any liability or obligation which
may arise under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (" _WARN_ ")
Act and similar state or local rules, statutes and ordinances that is solely
the result of any acts or omissions of CIT Technologies or CIT prior to the
Closing or solely the result of the Closing (and, in each case, that does not
in any way arise as a result of any aggregation of any decisions made or
actions taken by CIT Technologies or CIT before, on or (with respect to any or
all of the Excepted Business Employees and Leave Employees) after the Closing
with any decisions made or actions taken by either Buyer on or after the
Closing), and will indemnify, defend and hold Buyers harmless from and against
any and all such liabilities in accordance with _Section 11.1_. US Buyer
shall be solely responsible for any liability or obligation which may arise
under the



 

51 WARN Act and similar state or local rules, statutes and ordinances that
results in whole or in part from any acts or omissions of either Buyer on or
after the Closing, including any such liability or obligation resulting from
any decisions made or actions taken by CIT Technologies or CIT before, on or
(with respect to any or all of the Excepted Business Employees and Leave
Employees) after the Closing which, when aggregated with any decisions made or
actions taken by either Buyer on or after the Closing, collectively cause or
are alleged to cause the occurrence of a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (or
any comparable terms) or other liability or obligation within the meaning of
the WARN Act or any similar state or local rules, statutes or ordinances, and
US Buyer will indemnify, defend and hold Sellers harmless from and
against any and all such liabilities in accordance with _Section 11.2_. Upon
request, Sellers shall advise Buyers of the number of employee terminations at
each facility of the Business that have occurred during the 90-day period
prior to the Closing. 



(i) Buyers shall have the obligation and liability for any workersÂ’
compensation or similar workersÂ’ protection claims of any Transferred Business
Employee incurred on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Sellers shall retain the obligation and liability for any workersÂ’
compensation or similar workersÂ’ protection claims with respect to any
Transferred Business Employee, whether incurred prior to, on or after the
Closing Date which are the result of an injury or illness originating prior to
the Closing Date (as evidenced by the Transferred Business EmployeeÂ’s
submission of the initial workersÂ’ compensation or similar workersÂ’ protection
claim with respect thereto prior to the Closing Date).



(j) Buyers shall be responsible for providing any Transferred
Business Employee and any eligible dependent or spouse thereof who has a
"qualifying event" within the meaning of section 4980B(f) of the Code after
the Closing Date with health care continuation coverage as required by section
4980B(f) of the Code (or comparable state law) to the extent required by law.
Sellers shall be responsible for providing any employee of the Business and
any eligible dependent or spouse thereof who has a "qualifying event" within
the meaning of section 4980B(f) of the Code on or prior to the Closing Date
with health care continuation coverage as required by section 4980B(f) of the
Code (or comparable state law) to the extent required by law.



(k) No Transferred Business Employee or other current or former employee
of either Seller or CIT, including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or
any other person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert
any claim hereunder.



8.5. _Nontransferable Letters of Credit_.



(a) Following the Closing Date, Buyers shall use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain a replacement letter of credit for each Nontransferable Letter of
Credit, showing the applicable Buyer as the beneficiary thereof, and Sellers
shall cooperate with Buyers to obtain any such replacement. Should Buyers fail
to obtain such replacement letter of credit, Sellers shall have no further
liability to Buyer for the applicable Nontransferable Letter of Credit, except
as provided herein. Buyers shall promptly notify Sellers of the issuance of
any such replacement or of the expiration of any Nontransferable Letter
of Credit. Upon the expiration of a Nontransferable Letter of Credit, Sellers
shall have no further liability and obligation to Buyers therefor.



 

52 (b) If any event shall occur prior to the earlier of (i) the second
anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the expiration date of a
Nontransferable Letter of Credit that permits a draw for the benefit of a
Buyer under a Nontransferable Letter of Credit, the original of which is in
the possession of a Seller along with all documents required to be presented
for a draw, such Seller shall, if requested by such Buyer, request a draw in
accordance with the terms of such Nontransferable Letter of Credit in an
amount specified by such Buyer (but in no event greater than the amount
available to be drawn under such letter of credit). Solely for purposes of
making a draw under a Nontransferable Letter of Credit, such Seller shall be
deemed to have such interest as is necessary with respect to the applicable
Purchased Lease Document to make the draw.



(c) Except as provided in this _Section 8.5_ , Sellers shall not take any
action with respect to a Nontransferable Letter of Credit without the prior
written consent of Buyers. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyers of any notices
or other communications that Seller receives with respect to
any Nontransferable Letter of Credit.



8.6. _Business Trade Secrets_. Each Seller and their respective Affiliates
shall have the right to use each of the Business Trade Secrets in each other
business of such Person that was currently using the Business Trade Secret,
provided that each such Person shall seek to maintain the confidentiality of
the same using the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own Trade
Secrets.

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF CIT AND SELLERS



The obligations of CIT and Sellers under this Agreement shall, at the option
of CIT or a Seller, be subject to the satisfaction or waiver, on or prior to
the Closing Date, of the following conditions:



10.1. _No Misrepresentation or Breach of Covenants and Warranties_. There
shall have been no material breach by either Buyer in the performance of any
of their respective covenants and agreements herein; each of the
representations and warranties of either Buyer contained or referred to herein
that is qualified by material adverse change, material adverse effect or
similar materiality limitations shall be true and correct, and each of
the representations and warranties of either Buyer contained or referred to
herein that is not so qualified shall be true and correct in all material
respects, in each case on the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date,
except for changes in conformity with the covenants and terms hereof and
changes resulting from any transaction expressly consented to in writing by
CIT Technologies or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement; and there
shall have been delivered to CIT and Sellers a certificate to such effect,
dated the Closing Date and signed on behalf of each Buyer by its President or
any Vice President.



10.2. _No Restraint or Litigation_. No action, suit or proceeding by any
Governmental Body shall have been instituted or threatened to restrain,
prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality or validity of the transactions
contemplated hereby.



 

54 10.3. _Necessary Governmental Approvals_. The parties shall have received all
approvals and actions of or by all Governmental Bodies necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, which are required to be
obtained prior to the Closing by applicable Requirements of Laws.



Notwithstanding the failure of any one or more of the foregoing
conditions, CIT and Sellers may proceed with the Closing without
satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any one or more of such conditions and
without written waiver. To the extent that at the Closing either Buyer
delivers to CIT and Sellers a written notice specifying in reasonable detail
the failure of any of such conditions or the breach by a Buyer of any of the
representations or warranties of Buyer herein, and nevertheless CIT and
Sellers proceed with the Closing, CIT and Sellers shall be deemed to have
waived for all purposes any rights or remedies it may have against Buyers by
reason of the failure of any such conditions or the breach of any such
representations or warranties to the extent described in such notice.

_provided_ , _however_ , that:



(A) Buyers shall not be entitled to indemnification under clause (iv) above
with respect to Buyer Losses which, on an individual basis, do not exceed

relate to, the same event, occurrence or condition shall be aggregated for
purposes of determining the applicability of this clause (A));



 

55 (B) Sellers shall be required to indemnify and hold harmless under clause (iv)
above with respect to Buyer Losses unless the aggregate amount of such Buyer
Losses subject to indemnification by Sellers under such clause (iv) exceeds
$375,000, and once such amount is exceeded, Sellers shall indemnify Buyers
only for the amount of Buyer Losses in excess of such amount; and



(C) in no event shall the aggregate amount required to be paid by Sellers
pursuant to this _Section 11.1(a)_ (other than in respect of _Sections
11.1(a)((i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , as to which there shall be no limitation)
exceed $10,000,000; and



_provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer Losses incurred as a result of the
inaccuracies of the representations and warranties contained in _Section

(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.1(a)_  shall terminate on
the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by
either Buyer under this _Section 11.1_ thereafter), except that the
indemnification by Sellers shall be as follows as to:



(i) the representations and warranties set forth in  _Sections 5.1_ ,
_5.2(a)_ and _5.7_ , the covenants of Sellers set forth in _Sections 13.2_ ,
_13.9_ and _13.12_ , the obligations and representations under the Instrument

amount of Buyer Loss arising from such matters in accordance with this
_Article XI_.



(c) Buyers agree to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
all Buyer Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Buyer Losses that are indemnified
hereunder, and the failure of Buyers to take such steps shall reduce the
indemnification obligation of Sellers as to such Losses to the extent not
mitigated because of such failure.



 

56 11.2. _Indemnification by Buyers_.



(a) Buyers agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group
Member from and against any and all Loss and Expense incurred by such Seller
Group Member (the " _Seller Losses_ ") in connection with or arising from:



 

(i) any breach or failure to perform by either Buyer of any of its covenants
or obligations in this Agreement or in any Buyer Ancillary Agreement;



(ii) any failure by Buyers to perform any of the Assumed Liabilities;



(iii) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of
either Buyer contained in this Agreement as of the date hereof or in the
certificate delivered by or on behalf of either Buyer pursuant to _Section
10.1_ as of the Closing Date; or



(iv) any draw properly made at the instruction of a Buyer by either Seller
under a Nontransferable Letter of Credit pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_.



(b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 11.2(a)_ shall terminate on
the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by
any Seller Group Member under this _Section 11.2_ thereafter), except that the
indemnification by Buyers shall be as follows as to:



(i) the obligations of Buyer under the Instrument of Assumption-Canada and the
instrument of Assumption-US, the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 6.1_ and _6.2(a)_ and the covenants of Buyers set forth in _Sections

(iii) unresolved matters described in a Claim Notice delivered by any Seller
Group Member to Buyers in accordance with the requirements of  _Section 11.3_
on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in
accordance with this _Section 11.2_ , as to which the obligation of Buyers
shall continue until the liability of Buyers shall have been
determined pursuant to this _Article XI_ , and Buyers shall have reimbursed
all Seller Group Members for the full amount of Seller Loss arising from such
matters in accordance with this _Article XI_.



(c) Sellers agree to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
all Losses and Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses or Expenses that are
indemnified hereunder, and the failure of Sellers to take such steps shall
reduce the indemnification obligation of Buyers as to such Losses to the
extent not mitigated because of such failure.



 

57 11.3. _Notice of Claims_.



(a) Buyers or any Seller Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give to the party obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to
any claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice
(if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such
claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any
other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection
herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , that a Claim Notice in
respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as
to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the
action or suit is commenced ( _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give
such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure).



(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article XI_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of
proof in establishing the amount of Loss and Expense suffered by it.



(c) Losses to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled hereunder shall
not include exemplary, punitive, speculative, remote or consequential damages;
_provided_ that if an Indemnified Party is obligated to pay a third Person
(other than an Affiliate of the Indemnified Party) damages which
include exemplary, punitive, speculative, remote or consequential damages and
the Indemnitor is obligated under this _Article XI_ to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for Losses in respect of the matter giving rise to such
damages, then Losses to which the Indemnified Party shall be entitled shall
include such damages.



11.4. _Third Person Claims_.



(a) Subject to _Section 11.4(b)_ , the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense,
compromise or settlement of any third Person claim, action or suit against
such Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought by the
Indemnified Party from the Indemnitor hereunder, and in any such case the
Indemnitor shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish such
records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnified Party in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the
Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its
own expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit as to which the
Indemnified Party has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), pay, compromise or settle any such claim, action or suit.
Notwithstanding the



 

58 foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or
compromise any such claim, action or suit without such consent, _provided_ ,
that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity
therefor hereunder unless such consent was unreasonably withheld.



(b) If any third Person claim, action or suit against an Indemnified Party is
solely for money damages or, where a Seller is the Indemnitor, will have no
continuing effect in any material respect on the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or either Buyer, then the Indemnitor shall have the right to
conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise
or settlement of any such third Person claim, action or suit against the
Indemnified Party as to which indemnification will be sought by the
Indemnified Party from the Indemnitor hereunder if the Indemnitor has
acknowledged and agreed in writing that, if the same is adversely determined,
the Indemnitor has an obligation to provide indemnification to the Indemnified
Party in respect thereof to the extent provided herein, and in any such case
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall
furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested by such Indemnitor in connection therewith;  _provided_ , that the
Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own
expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit as to which the
Indemnitor has so elected to conduct and control the defense
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay, settle or compromise any such claim, action or suit; _provided_
, that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity
therefor hereunder. 



11.5. _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a
matter of law, if the Closing occurs, this _Article XI_ shall be the exclusive
remedy for the breach of the representations and warranties contained or
referred to in this Agreement, any Seller Ancillary Agreement or any Buyer
Ancillary Agreement, or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of any party
hereto or thereto.



11.6. _Computation of Losses_. The amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this _Article XI_ shall be reduced by any
insurance recovery if and when actually realized or received, in each case in
respect of such Losses. Any such recovery shall be promptly repaid by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnitor following the time at which such recovery
is realized or received pursuant to the previous sentence, minus all
reasonably allocable costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party in obtaining such recovery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (x) the
amount of Losses for which the Indemnitor is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party is reduced by any in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 11.6_ , and (y) the Indemnified Party subsequently is required to
repay the amount of any such insurance recovery or such insurance recovery is
disallowed, then the obligation of the Indemnitor to indemnify with respect to
such amounts shall be reinstated immediately and such amounts shall be paid
promptly to the Indemnified Party in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.



11.7. _Comparative Fault_. Any Loss sustained by an Indemnified Party shall
be reduced to the extent such partyÂ’s own negligence or breach of
representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement caused such
Loss.



 

59 11.8. _Subrogation_. Upon making any indemnification payment, the Indemnitor
will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party against any third party in respect of the Loss and Expense
to which the payment relates. Without limiting the generality of any other
provision hereof, each such Indemnitor and Indemnified Party will duly
execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and
perfect the above-described subrogation rights.



11.9. _Indemnification Payments as Purchase Price Adjustment_. Sellers and
Buyers agree that, for purposes of computing the amount of
any indemnification payment under this _Article XI_ , any such
indemnification payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes.



11.10. _GST/QST Gross-Up_. The Indemnitor agrees to pay to the Indemnified
Party, in addition to any indemnification payments under this _Article XI_ ,
any applicable GST and/or PST payable or remittable in connection with such
payments.



ARTICLE XII



TERMINATION



12.1. _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing.



(a) by the consent of all parties hereto;



(b) by any party hereto if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
August 1, 2004;



(c) by Buyers in the event of any material breach by CIT or either Seller
of any of its agreements, representations or warranties contained herein and
the failure of CIT or such Seller to cure such breach within ten days after
receipt of notice from Buyers requesting such breach to be cured;



(d) by CIT or either Seller in the event of any material breach by
either Buyer of any of such BuyerÂ’s agreements, representations or warranties
contained herein and the failure of such Buyer to cure such breach within ten
days after receipt of notice from CIT or Sellers requesting such breach to be
cured; or 



(e) by Buyers, CIT or Sellers if any court of competent jurisdiction in the
United States of America or Canada or other Governmental Body shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.



12.2. _Notice of Termination_. Any party desiring to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 12.1_ shall give notice of such termination to all other
parties to this Agreement.



 

60 12.3. _Non-Solicitation_. If this Agreement is terminated, neither Buyer nor
any of their Affiliates will, prior to the second anniversary of such
termination, without the prior written approval of CIT and Sellers, solicit or
cause to be solicited the employment of, or hire, any person who is an
employee of either Seller on the date hereof or at any time hereafter that
precedes such termination; _provided_ that the foregoing provision shall not
prohibit the solicitation or employment of any such person (i) resulting from
general advertisements for employment conducted by US Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including any recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment
agency, provided that US Buyer and its Affiliates have not directed such
recruitment efforts at such person), (ii) if such person approaches US
Buyer or one of its Affiliates on an unsolicited basis or (iii) following
cessation of such personÂ’s employment with either Seller without any
solicitation or encouragement, directly or indirectly, by US Buyer or one of
its Affiliates. Without limiting the rights of CIT and Sellers to pursue all
other legal and equitable rights available for a violation of this _Section
12.3_ by Buyers or their Affiliates, the parties hereto agree that other
remedies cannot fully compensate CIT or Sellers for such a violation and that
CIT and Sellers shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent a violation
or continuing violation hereof. It is the intent and understanding of each
party hereto that if, in any action before any court or agency legally
empowered to enforce this _Section 12.3_ , any term, restriction, covenant or
promise in this _Section 12.3_ is found to be unreasonable and for that reason
unenforceable, then such term, restriction, covenant or promise shall be
deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable by such court
or agency.



12.4. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant
to this _Article XII_ , all further obligations of the parties under this
Agreement (other than _Sections 12.3_ , _13.2_ and _13.9_ and other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) shall be terminated without further liability of
any party to the other; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for its willful breach of this Agreement.



ARTICLE XIII



GENERAL PROVISIONS



13.1. _Survival of Obligations_. All representations, warranties, covenants
and obligations contained in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
except as otherwise provided in  _Article XI_ , the representations and
warranties contained in _Articles V_ and _VI_ shall terminate on the 18-month
anniversary of the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided herein, no claim
shall be made for the breach of any representation or warranty contained in
_Article V_ or _VI_ or under any certificate delivered with respect thereto
under this Agreement after the date on which such representations and
warranties terminate as set forth in this _Section 13.1_.



13.2. _Confidential Nature of Information_. Each party agrees that it will
treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information which it

investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this Agreement and
other related documents, and, if the transactions contemplated hereby shall
not be consummated, each party will return to the other party all copies of
nonpublic documents and materials which



 

61 have been furnished in connection therewith. Such documents, materials and
information shall not be communicated to any third Person (other than, in the
case of Buyers, to their counsel, accountants, financial advisors or lenders,
and in the case of CIT and Sellers, to their counsel, accountants or financial
advisors). No other party shall use any confidential information in any
manner whatsoever except solely for the purpose of evaluating the proposed
purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Closing, Buyers may use or disclose any confidential information included
in the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities or otherwise reasonably related
to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities. The obligation of each party
to treat such documents, materials and other information in confidence shall
not apply to any information which (a) is or becomes available to such party
from a source other than such party, (b) is or becomes available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by such party or its agents, (c) is
required to be disclosed under applicable law or judicial process, or to any

reasonably deems necessary to disclose to obtain any of the consents or
approvals contemplated hereby.



13.3.  _No Public Announcement_. No party hereto shall, without the approval
of the other parties hereto, make any press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as and to the extent that any such parties shall be so obligated by
law or the rules of any stock exchange, in which case the other parties shall
be advised and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause a
mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; _provided_ , that
the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to
implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with the stock
exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations.



13.4. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or delivered (a) when

such party hereto prior to the Closing without the written consent of all
other parties, except that the rights of US Buyer hereunder may be assigned
prior to the Closing, without the consent of any party hereto, to any

or membership interests of which are owned or controlled by US Buyer,
_provided_ that (i) the assignee shall assume in writing all of US
BuyerÂ’s obligations hereunder, (ii) US Buyer shall not be released from any
of its obligations hereunder by reason of such assignment and (iii) SellersÂ’
obligations under this Agreement shall be subject to the delivery by such
assignee, on or prior to the Closing Date, of a certificate signed on its
behalf containing representations and warranties similar to those made by US
Buyer in _Article VI_. Following the Closing, any party may assign any of its
rights hereunder, but no such assignment shall relieve it of its obligations
hereunder.



(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Except for any
Person entitled to indemnification under _Article XI_ who is not a party to
this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties and
successors and assigns permitted by this _Section 13.5_ any right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.



 

63 13.6. _Access to Records after Closing_.



(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, CIT, Sellers and
their representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and
records, including computer files, transferred by Sellers to Buyers hereunder
to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by CIT or Sellers in
connection with matters relating to or affected by its operations prior to
the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyers upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. CIT and Sellers
shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant
to this _Section 13.6(a)_. If Buyers shall desire to dispose of any of such
books and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyers
shall, prior to such disposition, give CIT and Sellers a reasonable
opportunity, at their expense, to segregate and remove such books and records
as CIT and Sellers may select.



(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyers and their
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
which CIT, Sellers or their Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date
relating to the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities. Such access shall be
afforded by CIT, Sellers and their Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours. Buyers shall be solely
responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this
_Section 13.6(b)_. If CIT, Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall desire to
dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-
year period, CIT and Sellers shall, prior to such disposition, give Buyers a
reasonable opportunity, at their expense, to segregate and remove such books
and records as Buyers may select.



13.7. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement and the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the
subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the
parties hereto, including the Confidentiality Agreement, except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect until the Closing. This
Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written
instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties
hereto. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto referenced by a
particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other section in this Agreement. Neither the
specification of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule
hereto is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or
the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. CIT or either
Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, by notice in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement, amend or create any
Schedule, in order to add information or correct previously supplied
information. No such amendment shall be evidence, in and of itself, that
the representations and warranties in the corresponding section are no longer
true and correct in all material respects. It is specifically agreed that such
Schedules may be amended to add immaterial, as well as material, items
thereto. No such supplemental, amended or additional Schedule shall be deemed
to cure any breach for purposes of _Section 9.1_. If, however, the



 

64 Closing occurs, any such supplement, amendment or addition will be effective
to cure and correct for all other purposes any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant which would have existed if CIT or Sellers had not made
such supplement, amendment or addition, and all references to any Schedule
hereto which is supplemented or amended as provided in this  _Section 13.7_
shall for all purposes after the Closing be deemed to be a reference to such
Schedule as so supplemented or amended.



13.8. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the
time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to
the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently
authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is
authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right
of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver
of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any
other or subsequent breach.



13.9. _Expenses_. Each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident
to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance
and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part
to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of its counsel and accountants.



13.10. _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained
herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof,
unless such a construction would be unreasonable.



13.11. _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument,
but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall
become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties hereto and delivered to all other parties hereto.



13.12. _Further Assurances_.



(a) On the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyers such other bills of
sale, deeds, endorsements, assignments and other good and sufficient
instruments of conveyance and transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to
Buyers and their counsel, as Buyers may reasonably request or as may be
otherwise be reasonably necessary to vest in Buyers all the right, title
and interest of Sellers in, to or under any or all of the Purchased Assets,
and Buyers shall deliver to Sellers such other instruments of assumption, in
form reasonably satisfactory to Sellers and their counsel, as Sellers may
reasonably request. From time to time following the Closing, Sellers shall
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such
other instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyers may reasonably request
or as may be



 

65 otherwise necessary to more effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in,
Buyers any part of the Purchased Assets, and Buyers shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Sellers such other
instruments of assumption as Seller may reasonably request. If any rights
included in the Purchased Assets under any Purchased Lease Documents or
Business Agreements cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the
consent of third parties, which consent has not been obtained prior to the
Closing, Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to secure to Buyers
the benefits thereof through the exercise of the rights of Sellers
thereunder.



(b) Sellers recognize the possible need of US Buyer to have audited financial
statements relating to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
covering at least one fiscal year prior to the Closing Date and to have
unaudited interim financial statements for the period from January 1, 2004 to
the Closing Date. In light of this possible need, Sellers will use
commercially reasonable efforts upon BuyersÂ’ request to (i) provide Buyers
with such financial information relating to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities and the Business as shall be in the possession of Sellers,
including internal financial reports, payroll reports and other relevant
financial information, covering the period under audit and the unaudited
interim period, (ii) provide Buyers and their independent accountants with
access during normal business hours to the accounting and financial personnel
of Sellers who have prepared such reports or information and who are familiar
with accounting matters with respect to the Business, and (iii) if
applicable, provide access to the independent accountants of Sellers who are
familiar with accounting matters relating to the Business.



(c) Buyers recognize the possible need of CIT and Sellers to have access to
certain records relating to the Business and to certain personnel of Buyers
in connection with Excluded Liabilities. In light of this possible need,
Buyers will use commercially reasonable efforts upon the request of CIT or a
Seller to provide such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the Excluded Liabilities.



13.13. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Neither CIT nor either Seller makes any
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information provided to Buyers. There is no assurance that any
projected or forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS
EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY CIT AND SELLERS PURSUANT TO _SECTION 4.4_ ,
SELLERS ARE SELLING THE PURCHASED ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND CIT
AND SELLERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Buyers acknowledge that
neither CIT nor either Seller nor any of their representatives or any
other Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as
to the accuracy or completeness of any memoranda, charts or summaries
heretofore made available by CIT, Sellers or their representatives to Buyers
or any other information which is not included in this Agreement or the
Schedules hereto, and neither CIT nor either Seller nor any of their
representatives or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability
to Buyers, any



 

66 Affiliate of Buyers or any other Person resulting from the distribution of any
such information to, or use of any such information by, Buyers, any Affiliate
of Buyers or any of their agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other
representatives.



13.14. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflict of laws
provisions) of the State of Delaware.



13.15. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submit in any suit, action or proceeding among them arising out of or related
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware, and waive any and all objections to jurisdiction that they may
have under the laws of the United States of America.



13.16. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.



EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, TO
IT THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13.16_.



 

67 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed the day and year first above written.
