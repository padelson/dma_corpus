**ARTICLE III** 
  **CONVERSION OF SHARES; CONSIDERATION**

  

3.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of Bluegreen Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Bluegreen Common Stock to be canceled  pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_
and the Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, any party hereto or any other
Person, be converted into the right to receive $10.00 in cash, without
interest thereon (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The preferred share
purchase rights associated with each share of Bluegreen Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of 
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, any party
hereto or any other Person, be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, as the value of such
preferred share purchase rights is included within the value of the associated
share of Bluegreen Common Stock.

  

(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and  without any action
on the part of any party hereto or any other Person, be converted into one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation, so that after the Effective Time, Woodbridge
shall be the holder of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

(c) All shares of Bluegreen Common Stock that are owned by BFC,
Woodbridge or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, be canceled and shall cease to  exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(d) At the Effective Time, each share of Bluegreen Common Stock
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ shall be automatically canceled and shall  cease to exist,
upon the conversion thereof, and the holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of shares of outstanding Bluegreen Common Stock not represented
by certificates, if any (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), and the holders of
certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represent shares
of outstanding Bluegreen Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Bluegreen Common Stock  other
than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2_ , the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon, for each such share of Bluegreen Common Stock
held by them. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
the Book-Entry Shares or the Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2_
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the  Bluegreen Common Stock exchanged theretofore
and represented by such Book-Entry Shares or Certificates.

  

(e) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time any change in the number of outstanding shares of Bluegreen
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a stock split  (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the
amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates; Payments_.

  

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, BFC, Woodbridge or
Merger Sub shall deliver or cause to be delivered, in trust, to such bank or
trust company that may be designated by them and is  reasonably satisfactory
to Bluegreen (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Bluegreen Common Stock at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for
timely payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ in exchange for all issued and outstanding shares of Bluegreen
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Bluegreen Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section  3.1(c)_ ) (the "
_Consideration Fund_ "). In the event the Consideration Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, BFC, Woodbridge or
Merger Sub shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds
to the Paying Agent in an amount equal to such deficiency.

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event not
later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each  holder of
record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , (i)
a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or  Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry Share or a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
with such other documents as may be required  pursuant to such instructions
or as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Book-Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes pursuant to _Section
3.3_ , the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.1_ ,
and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration 
payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates. If any Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the
Book-Entry Share or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Book-Entry  Share or Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  



    

      11

--- 
   

    

(c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent if and as directed by Woodbridge; provided that any such investments
shall be in cash or securities issued or directly and fully  guaranteed or
insured as to principal and interest by the United States government or any
agency or instrumentality thereof and having maturities of not more than one
month from the date of investment. Earnings on the Consideration Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Woodbridge and shall be paid to Woodbridge
as it directs. No investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve
Woodbridge or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_ , and  following any losses from any such investment,
Woodbridge shall promptly provide, or cause to be provided, additional funds
to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Bluegreen
Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds shall be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.

  

(d) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of Bluegreen
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Bluegreen Common Stock that were  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration with respect to the Bluegreen Common Stock formerly
represented thereby pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , except as otherwise provided
by Law.

  

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the
proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former
shareholders of Bluegreen otherwise entitled thereto for one  year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this _Section 3.2_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent,
BFC, Woodbridge, Merger Sub, Bluegreen or the Surviving Corporation, nor any
shareholder, partner, member, Representative or  Affiliate thereof, shall be
liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect
thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or 
Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with the provisions of this
_Section 3.2_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall
be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Woodbridge and the Paying  Agent) by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to which
such Person is entitled in respect of such Certificate pursuant to _Section
3.1_.

  



    

      12

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, Bluegreen shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any
other dispositions of equity securities of Bluegreen in  connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under such section of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

3.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement  (including any
payments made pursuant to the Merger and any payments made in respect of the
Dissenting Shares) to any holder of shares of Bluegreen Common Stock or
Bluegreen Stock Options, such amounts required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid to the appropriate Taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent,  such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Bluegreen Common
Stock or Bluegreen Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  

3.4 _Bluegreen Options and Stock Awards_.

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Bluegreen shall take all
actions necessary to cause each option to purchase shares of Bluegreen Common
Stock issued by Bluegreen under any Bluegreen Equity  Compensation Plan and
outstanding at the Effective Time (each, a " _Bluegreen Option_ "), whether or
not vested or exercisable, to be canceled as of the Effective Time; provided,
however, that the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but in any event no later than five Business Days after the Effective
Time) a cash payment in respect of each share of Bluegreen Common Stock  then
subject to such Bluegreen Option, whether or not such Bluegreen Option was
vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time, in an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share with respect to such Bluegreen Option (subject to
applicable Tax withholding requirements and without interest). No
consideration shall be paid hereunder in respect of shares of Bluegreen Common
Stock subject to Bluegreen Options  which have an exercise price equal to or
greater than the per share Merger Consideration.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Bluegreen shall take all
actions necessary to cause each restricted stock award and restricted stock
unit award, if any, of Bluegreen Common Stock granted by Bluegreen  under any
Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plan and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a " _Bluegreen Stock Award_ ") to become fully vested as
of the Effective Time with respect to the maximum number of shares of
Bluegreen Common Stock subject thereto, which shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the same manner as other
shares of Bluegreen Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

  



    

      13  
--- 
   

  

        
--- 
   

    

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Bluegreen shall take all
actions necessary to cause each Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plan to
terminate as of the Effective Time.

  

3.5 _Appraisal Rights_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
and unless otherwise provided by applicable Law, each share of Bluegreen
Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the
Effective Time and which is owned by a shareholder who, pursuant to Sections
13.01-13.31 of the MBCA, duly and validly exercises and perfects his, her or
its appraisal rights with respect to his, her or its shares of Bluegreen
Common Stock (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the
right to receive, or be exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration, but,
instead, the holder thereof, with respect to such Dissenting Shares, shall be
entitled  to payment in cash from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised
value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Sections
13.01-13.31 of the MBCA. If any such holder shall have failed to duly and
validly exercise or perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights, each share of Bluegreen Common Stock of such holder as to
which appraisal rights were not duly and validly exercised or perfected, or
were effectively withdrawn or lost, shall  not be deemed a Dissenting Share
and shall automatically be converted into and shall thereafter be exchangeable
only for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Agreement.

  

(b) Bluegreen will provide BFC and Woodbridge (i) prompt notice
of any written demands received by Bluegreen for appraisal of shares of
Bluegreen Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands  and any other
instruments served on and received by Bluegreen pursuant to the MBCA, and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any demands for appraisal under the MBCA. Bluegreen shall not,
except with the prior written consent of BFC or Woodbridge, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such
demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

5.2 _Capitalization_.

  

(a) Bluegreen's authorized capital stock consists solely of
140,000,000 shares of Bluegreen Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share (collectively,  the " _Bluegreen Capital
Stock_ "). As of the date hereof, 31,555,513 shares of Bluegreen Common Stock
are issued and outstanding, including 204,766 shares subject to Bluegreen
Stock Awards. Each share of Bluegreen Common Stock has attached thereto an
associated preferred share purchase right which was issued under the Bluegreen
Rights Agreement. No shares of preferred stock, including shares designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, are issued or  outstanding as
of the date hereof. As of the date hereof, approximately 10,460,237 shares of
Bluegreen Common Stock are reserved for issuance under the Bluegreen Equity
Compensation Plans (including, without limitation, 1,151,225 shares of
Bluegreen Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding
Bluegreen Options). Bluegreen does not currently hold, and under the MBCA may

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of Bluegreen
Capital Stock are duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. None of the outstanding shares of Bluegreen Capital  Stock
have been issued in violation of any statutory preemptive rights. Bluegreen
Common Stock is the only class of securities of Bluegreen with the right to
vote on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for the election of
directors of Bluegreen. Except for Bluegreen Options outstanding on the date
hereof to acquire not more than 1,151,225 shares of Bluegreen Common Stock and
except as contemplated by the Bluegreen Rights Agreement, there are no
outstanding or existing  Bluegreen Options or other agreements, commitments
or obligations relating to the issuance of additional shares of any class of
capital stock or other equity securities of Bluegreen.

  

(c) All outstanding Bluegreen Options and Bluegreen Stock
Awards were granted under the Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plans, and none
were issued in violation of applicable Law or the terms of  the applicable
Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plan. Other than Bluegreen's current share
repurchase program, as described in the Bluegreen SEC Reports, Bluegreen is
not a party to or bound by any contract, agreement or arrangement to sell or
otherwise dispose of or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any of its
capital stock. There are no agreements or understandings with respect to the
voting of any shares of Bluegreen Capital Stock or which restrict the transfer
of such shares  to which Bluegreen is a party, nor does Bluegreen have
knowledge of any such agreements or understandings to which Bluegreen is not a
party. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.2_ , since September 30, 2012,
Bluegreen has not (i) issued any shares of Bluegreen Capital Stock (or
securities exercisable for or convertible into Bluegreen Capital Stock) other
than upon the valid exercise of Bluegreen Options previously granted under any
Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plan or (ii) granted  any Bluegreen Options or
Bluegreen Stock Awards under any Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plan. The terms
of each of the Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plans permit the cancellation of
outstanding Bluegreen Options and Bluegreen Stock Awards as provided in this
Agreement without the consent or approval of the holders thereof, any other
shareholders of Bluegreen, or any other Person (other than Bluegreen's Board
of Directors or a committee thereof). _Schedule 5.2_ hereto includes  a true
and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all holders of outstanding
Bluegreen Options and Bluegreen Stock Awards, including the name of such

Award, the number of shares of Bluegreen Common Stock purchasable upon
exercise of the Bluegreen Option or subject to the Bluegreen Stock Award, the
exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per share and the expiration
date. There are no awards  outstanding as of the date hereof under any
Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plan other than those identified on _Schedule
5.2_. A true and complete copy of the Bluegreen Equity Compensation Plans and
all contracts, agreements and other instruments relating to or issued
thereunder have been made available to BFC, and no such plan, contract,
agreement or other instrument has been amended, modified or supplemented, and
there is no agreement to amend, modify or supplement any such plan, 
contract, agreement or other instrument in any case from the form made

of Merger pursuant to the FBCA), and, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and assuming the due and valid authorization, execution and

7.1 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof through the
Effective Time, Bluegreen shall permit BFC, Woodbridge and Merger Sub, and
their authorized Representatives, reasonable access during  regular business
hours to the properties of Bluegreen and each of its Subsidiaries. Bluegreen
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make its directors, management and

7.2 _Public Announcements_. Any public announcement made by or on
behalf of any party hereto prior to the termination of this Agreement
concerning this Agreement, the Merger or other transactions  contemplated
hereby or any other aspect of the dealings between the parties as contemplated

not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), subject to applicable Law,
provided such party shall use its reasonable efforts in good faith to consult
with the other party or parties as to all such public announcements.

  

7.3 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until such time,
if any, as Bluegreen's shareholders approve this Agreement in accordance with
the MBCA, subject to _Section 7.3(b)_ ,  without the prior written consent of
Woodbridge, Bluegreen will not, and will not permit its directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other
Representatives, agents or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposals or any inquiries or
proposals that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposals, (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide
any  non-public information to any Person in connection with, any Acquisition
Proposal or under circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in
an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) agree to, approve, recommend or otherwise
endorse or support any Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal relating to a possible (A)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving  Bluegreen or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) sale, lease,
exchange, transfer or other disposition (other than sales of inventory in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices), directly or
indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise (whether in
one or more transactions), of all or substantially all of the assets of
Bluegreen and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (C) liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of  transaction involving
Bluegreen or any of its Subsidiaries, (D) tender offer or exchange offer for
ten percent (10%) or more of the outstanding shares of Bluegreen Common Stock,
or other transaction involving Bluegreen in which any Person or group shall
acquire or have the right to acquire beneficial ownership of ten percent (10%)
or more of the outstanding shares of Bluegreen Common Stock or (E) transaction
which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing 
transactions; _provided, however_ , that the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ "
shall not include the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby or
related thereto (or any modification thereof or proposal relating thereto).
Bluegreen will, and will direct all of its directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other Representatives, agents
and Affiliates to, immediately cease any and all existing activities,
discussions or  negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.3(a)_ above, if
a Person or group other than BFC or any of its Affiliates (any such Person or
group, a " _Third Party_ ") after the  date of this Agreement submits to
Bluegreen or its Board of Directors or Special Committee, not resulting from a
breach of _Section 7.3(a)_ above, an unsolicited, bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal, and Bluegreen's Board of Directors or Special Committee
reasonably determines in good faith (i) after consultation with their
Representatives that such Acquisition Proposal will result in, or upon further
discussion with or due diligence by such Third Party could  reasonably be
expected to constitute or result in, a Superior Proposal and (ii) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take the action
set forth in (A) and (B) below may be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then, in such case Bluegreen may (A) furnish information
about its business to the Third Party under protection of an appropriate
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and
disclosure of all  non-public written or oral information furnished to such
Third Party, _provided_ that Bluegreen contemporaneously furnishes to
Woodbridge all such non-public information furnished to the Third Party and
(B) negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Third
Party with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. In the event that, after the
date of this Agreement and prior to such time, if any, as Bluegreen's
shareholders approve this Agreement in accordance  with the MBCA, Bluegreen
receives a Superior Proposal not in violation of _Section 7.3(a)_ and
Bluegreen's Board of Directors or Special Committee determines, in good faith
and after consultation with their Representatives, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with fiduciary duties owed by directors under applicable
Law, then Bluegreen's Board of Directors or Special Committee may: (x)
withhold, withdraw, modify or change its approval or recommendation of  this
Agreement or the Merger and/or (y) if applicable, approve or recommend the
Superior Proposal to Bluegreen's shareholders, _provided_ , in each case,
Bluegreen provides Woodbridge with at least two (2) Business Days prior
written notice stating that it intends to take such actions and setting forth
the information specified in _Section 7.3(c)_ with respect to any Superior
Proposal which it intends to accept or recommend. For purposes of this
Agreement,  " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited, bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal for consideration consisting of cash (not subject to a
financing contingency) and/or securities, and otherwise on terms which
Bluegreen's Board of Directors or Special Committee determines, after
consultation with their Representatives, are more favorable to Bluegreen's
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger or other revised
proposal submitted by  Woodbridge or its Affiliates prior to such
determination, taking into account the ability of the Third Party to
consummate the Superior Proposal on substantially the terms proposed. Nothing
contained herein shall prohibit Bluegreen from taking, and disclosing to its
shareholders, a position required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A of the SEC.

  

(c) Bluegreen will notify Woodbridge immediately, and in any
event within one (1) Business Day, if (i) an Acquisition Proposal is made or
is modified in any material respect (including, without  limitation, any
written material provided by the offeror, the principal terms and conditions
of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification thereto and the identity of
the offeror), in which case Bluegreen will provide a copy of the Acquisition
Proposal concurrently with such notice or (ii) Bluegreen furnishes non-public
information to, or enters into discussions or negotiations with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal with, any Third Party.

(d) In addition to the obligations set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_
, _(b)_ and _(c)_ , Bluegreen, as promptly as practicable, will advise
Woodbridge orally and in writing of any request for  information that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the material
terms and conditions of such request or inquiry, and keep Woodbridge informed
in all material respects of the status of any such request or inquiry.
Bluegreen shall also provide Woodbridge with prior telephonic (promptly
confirmed in writing) or written notice of any meeting of its Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof, including, the Special Committee) at
which its Board of  Directors or any such committee is expected or could
reasonably be expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal, together with a
copy of the documentation relating to such Acquisition Proposal to the extent
such documentation is then available (and otherwise provide such documentation
to Woodbridge as soon as available).

  

7.4 _Bluegreen Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E-3_.

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution
of this Agreement, Bluegreen shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it
with the SEC, and Bluegreen, BFC, Woodbridge, Merger Sub  and all other
filing Persons required by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
shall jointly prepare and file the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC.

  

(b) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from
the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement or the  Schedule 13E-3.
The parties shall notify each other promptly upon receipt by such party,
including any Affiliate or Representative of such party, of any comments from
the SEC or its staff with respect to, and of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3, and the parties shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between them, including any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, on the one  hand, and the SEC, or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3.

  

(c) Each of BFC, Woodbridge and Merger Sub shall cooperate with
Bluegreen in connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy
Statement, including promptly furnishing to Bluegreen in  writing upon
request any and all information relating to it as may be reasonably required
to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law. Each party shall
cooperate with the other parties in connection with the Schedule 13E-3. BFC,
Woodbridge and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the information supplied by them for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 will not, on the date
or dates the Proxy  Statement or Schedule 13E-3 is filed with the SEC, on the
date or dates the Proxy Statement is mailed to Bluegreen's shareholders, and
at the time of the Bluegreen Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Bluegreen shall use
its reasonable best efforts to ensure that (i)  the Proxy Statement and
Schedule 13E-3 will not, on the date or dates the Proxy Statement or Schedule
13E-3 is filed with the SEC, on the date or dates the Proxy Statement is
mailed to Bluegreen's shareholders, and at the time of the Bluegreen Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement will comply in
all  material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act,
provided, in each case, that Bluegreen assumes no responsibility with respect
to information supplied in writing, or failed to be supplied, by or on behalf
of BFC, Woodbridge or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3. Each party will use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Schedule 13E-3 complies in all material respects
with the applicable  requirements of the Exchange Act, provided BFC,
Woodbridge and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Bluegreen, on the other hand,
assume no responsibility with respect to information supplied in writing, or
failed to be supplied, by or on behalf of the other for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 13E-3. Prior to filing with the
SEC, or mailing to shareholders, of the Proxy Statement, filing the Schedule
13E-3 with the SEC, or filing any other required document (or, in  each case,
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each party shall provide the other with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall
include in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by the other
party.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms
that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3,
Bluegreen shall duly call, establish a record date for  and give notice of,
and thereafter as soon as reasonably practicable convene and hold, the
Bluegreen Meeting.

  

(b) Except as provided in _Section 7.3(b)_ with respect to the
right of Bluegreen's Special Committee or Board of Directors to withhold,

(a) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or who has been at
any time before the date hereof or who becomes before  the Effective Time, an
officer or director of Bluegreen (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid
in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of
Woodbridge, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, 
whether civil, criminal or administrative (each a " _Claim_ "), in which an
Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party based in whole or
in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is
or was a director or officer of Bluegreen if such Claim pertains to any matter
or fact arising, existing or occurring before the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the Merger) regardless of whether such Claim is asserted
or claimed  before, at or after the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified
Liabilities_ "), to the same extent provided for under the MBCA in effect as
of the date hereof and under the Articles of Organization or Bylaws of
Bluegreen as in effect on the date hereof. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding
to each Indemnified Party to the same extent provided for under the MBCA in
effect on the date hereof and under  the Articles of Organization or Bylaws
of Bluegreen as in effect on the date hereof upon receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable Law or the Articles of Organization or Bylaws of
Bluegreen as in effect on the date hereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 7.7(a)_ , upon learning of any
Claim, shall immediately notify Woodbridge (but the failure to so notify
Woodbridge shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under 
this _Section 7.7(a)_ except to the extent such failure prejudices Woodbridge)
and shall deliver to Woodbridge any undertaking required by applicable Law.
The Surviving Corporation shall ensure, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, that all limitations of liability existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Articles of Organization or Bylaws of
Bluegreen as in effect on the date hereof, or allowed under applicable Law as
in effect on the date hereof  with respect to Indemnified Liabilities, shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' and  in-house counsel liability
insurance maintained by Bluegreen (provided that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amount
containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous,
or in lieu thereof obtain single limit tail coverage providing at least the
same coverage and amount containing terms and conditions which are
substantially no less advantageous for such period (which shall be purchased
by Bluegreen  immediately prior to Closing upon the request of Woodbridge))
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time.

  

(c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation provided under
_Section 7.7(a)_ and _(b)_ are intended to be enforceable against the
Surviving Corporation directly by the Indemnified  Parties and shall be
binding on all successors and permitted assigns of the Surviving Corporation.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each
of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts in good faith to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or  cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable on the part of such party, to consummate
and make effective the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the earliest practicable date, including, without limitation,
obtaining all required consents, approvals, waivers, exemptions, amendments
and authorizations, giving all notices, and making or effecting all filings,
registrations, applications, designations and declarations, including, but not
limited  to, those described in the schedules to this Agreement, and each
party shall cooperate fully with the others (including by providing any
necessary information) with respect to the foregoing. In case, at any time,

Agreement, the proper officers and/or directors of the parties shall use all
reasonable efforts in good faith to take all such necessary action.

times after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, (i) each of BFC,
Woodbridge and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best  efforts to
consummate any and all financings required in order to consummate the Merger
(and promptly advise Bluegreen of any material developments with respect to

its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, to BFC,
Woodbridge and Merger Sub, such cooperation reasonably requested by them in
connection with the arrangement, syndication (including marketing efforts in
connection  therewith) and consummation of such financings, including
furnishing or making available financial and other information and documents,
participating in meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions, and
participating in the negotiation of, and executing and delivering, customary
financing agreements and documents, including loan agreements, promissory
notes, closing certificates and documents, and authorization letters, in each
case, as may be reasonably requested by Woodbridge;  provided that (A) such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Bluegreen or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) no obligation of
Bluegreen or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Lien on any of their respective
assets, in connection with any such financing shall be effective until the
Effective Time (other than any customary authorization letters) and (C) no
