#### (i) Upon selection of the CPA Firm pursuant to paragraph
(d) above, the Selling Parties shall submit any unresolved elements of its
objection to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to the Purchaser), supported

without reasonable cause shall constitute a withdrawal by the Selling Parties
of the Selling Parties Objection with respect to any unresolved element to
which such failure relates.

#### (ii) Within fifteen (15) days following the Selling
Parties submission of the unresolved elements of the Selling Parties
Objection as specified in subclause (i) above, the Purchaser shall submit
their response to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to the Selling
Parties), supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which they rely.

severally, on the other hand, so that the Selling Parties share of such costs
shall be in the same proportion that (x) the aggregate amount of the disputed
items submitted by the Selling Parties to the CPA Firm that are unsuccessfully
disputed bears to (y) the total amount of all disputed items submitted by the
Selling Parties to the CPA Firm. The Selling Parties, jointly and severally,
and Purchaser shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors and
advisors incurred in connection with the determination and review of the
Closing Statement.

 

### (e) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding on
the Parties upon the earliest of (i) if no the Selling Parties Objection has
been given with respect to the Closing Statement, the expiration of the period
within which the Selling Parties must make their objection pursuant to Section
2.3(c), (ii) agreement in writing by the Selling Parties and Purchaser that
the Closing Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed by the
Selling Parties and Purchaser, shall be final and binding, and (iii) the date
on which the CPA Firm shall issue its written determination with respect to
any dispute relating to the Closing Statement.

### (f) Promptly after the Closing Statement and the
determination of the Closing Cash Amount, the Closing Indebtedness, the
Working Capital as of the Closing and the resulting Total Purchase Price
calculated with reference to such amounts become final and binding on the
Parties under Section 2.3(e), the Total Purchase Price shall be recalculated
by giving effect to such components of the Total Purchase Price as set forth
in the final and binding Closing Statement (as recalculated, the " _Final
Purchase Price_ "). Any adjustment or non-adjustment to the Estimated
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall not form the basis for any
claim for damages pursuant to this Agreement. If the Estimated Purchase Price
is greater than the Final Purchase Price, the Selling Parties, jointly and
severally shall, and if the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated
Purchase Price, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties, make payment by
wire transfer to Purchaser or the Selling Parties (or their designees under
Section 2.2(a)), as the case may be, in immediately available funds of the
amount of such difference, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date to the date of payment at the Closing Date Interest Rate, which interest
shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed from the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any amounts owed by one Party to the other pending final resolution
of the Final Purchase Price which are not in dispute between the Selling
Parties and Purchaser shall promptly be paid (plus any interest calculated in
accordance with this clause (f)) and the disputed portion of the Final
Purchase Price shall be paid within five (5) Business Days after the Closing
Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties (plus any interest
calculated in accordance with this clause (f)).

be reasonable and prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, and
the regulations thereunder and (ii) include an allocation between the real
property and the tangible personal property of Rexam Closures LLC and Rexam
Closure Systems LLC. If RI approves of the Allocation, it shall promptly
return an executed copy thereof to Purchaser. If RI in good faith disapproves
of the Allocation, Purchaser and RI agree to promptly negotiate in good faith
an allocation agreeable to both Purchaser and RI. If Purchaser and RI are
unable to agree on an allocation, the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(d)
shall be used, _mutatis mutandis_ , with the disagreement by RI being treated
as the "Selling Parties Objection." Purchaser and the Selling Parties agree
to adopt and utilize the amounts so allocated (as agreed by the Parties or as
determined by the CPA Firm) for purposes of filing Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594 and all federal, state, local and other Tax Returns filed by them
and that they will not voluntarily take any position inconsistent therewith
upon examination of any such Tax Return, in any claim, in any litigation or
otherwise with respect to such Tax Returns, unless otherwise required to do so
pursuant to Applicable Law. The Selling Parties and Purchaser agree to
provide the other promptly with any other information required to complete

this Agreement, the foregoing agreement shall survive the Closing without
limitation.

notice to the Selling Parties, along with copies of all notices and documents
delivered by Bepensa to Rexam Mexico or Purchaser in connection with Bepensas
exercise of such option, within three Business Days following receipt of the
Option Notice; _provided_ that the failure to so notify the Selling Parties
within such period shall not relieve the Selling Parties of their obligations
hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have materially prejudiced
the Selling Parties. Such election by Bepensa shall be treated as a Third
Party Claim under Section 10.4(b) of this Agreement solely for purposes of
administrating such claims and the Selling Parties shall control and
administer such claim subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in
Section 10.4(b) (it being understood that the limitations on indemnification
set forth in Section 10.4 shall not apply to any such payment and no amounts
paid or payable in respect of such obligation shall be counted or considered
in any calculation made pursuant to Section 10.5). The Selling Parties shall
use their best efforts to settle any such claim or Put Election as promptly as
possible without any disruption to the business of Rexam Mega and to the
extent any costs in determining the Fair Market Value of Rexam Mega are
incurred by Rexam Mega, the Selling Parties shall be responsible for
Purchasers Proportionate Equity Share of such costs. If, Bepensa delivers or
causes to be delivered timely notice that it is exercising its right under the
JV Agreement to require Rexam Mexico or its Affiliates to purchase Bepensas
interest in Rexam Mega or exercises any other legal right to require Rexam
Mexico or its Affiliates to acquire its interest in Rexam Mega (a " _Put
Election_ "), then the Selling Parties shall pay Purchaser any amounts
determined to be owed by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including Rexam Mexico)
to Bepensa or any of its Affiliates in connection with Bepensa making such Put
Election. The Selling Parties shall not be required to pay Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including Rexam Mexico) any amounts if Bepensa exercises its right
to require Rexam Mexico to sell its interest in Rexam Mega to Bepensa (or its
Affiliates) at a price based on Fair Market Value (it being understood such
obligation to sell, if any, and the right to receive the proceeds of such sale
shall be Rexam Mexicos).

_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section

Party is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

 TAX MATTERS

 

Section 9.1 _Tax Sharing Agreements with the Target Entities_. Except as
set forth in Section 9.7, any tax sharing agreement between a Selling Party
and any Affiliate of a Selling Party (other than each of the Target Entities)
on the one hand, and a Target Entity, on the other hand, is terminated as of
the Closing Date and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether
the current year, a future year, or a past year).

 

Section 9.2 _Tax Returns and Taxes of the Target Entities_. (a) The
Selling Parties shall prepare or cause to be prepared (in a manner consistent
with past practices of the relevant Target Entity) all Tax Returns required to
be filed by or with respect to the Target Entity after the Closing Date for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period or portion thereof).
The Selling Parties shall cause the Target Entities to timely file such Tax
Returns and the Selling Parties shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such
Tax Returns; _provided_ that no such Tax Return shall be filed without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be

 

 

67    

 

 

unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided,_ _further_ , that Purchaser shall
deliver to the applicable Selling Party the amount of any such Taxes that are
included as a Current Liability on the Closing Statement not less than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns.

 



 

### (b) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
or with respect to the Target Entities (other than any Tax Returns described
in Sections 9.2(a) and 9.2(c)).

### (c) For any Tax period that includes but does not end on
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Purchaser shall timely prepare or
cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Target Entities and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns; _provided_ , that the Selling Parties shall deliver to
Purchaser or the applicable Target Entity, as directed by Purchaser, the
amount of such Taxes that are Excluded Taxes not less than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall
permit the Selling Parties to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence prior to the filing thereof, and shall not
file any such Tax Return without the prior written consent of the Selling
Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

### (d) In the case of a Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes
apportioned to the period ending on the Closing Date and to the period
beginning on the day after the Closing Date shall be determined as follows:
(i) Taxes measured by income or gain shall be apportioned based on an interim
closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date, (ii) Taxes
not measured by income or gain (other than Transfer Taxes) shall be
apportioned on the basis of elapsed days and (iii) Transfer Taxes shall be
allocated according to Section 9.4 if specified therein, and otherwise to the
period in which the related transaction occurred.

### (e) Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit any
Target Entity to, without the prior written consent of RI (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), amend any Tax Return of a Target Entity with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period resulting in a Tax for which a Selling Party would
be liable hereunder.

 

Section 9.3 _Tax Claims_. (a) If a notice of any pending or threatened
audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding shall be
delivered, or any claim shall be made, by any taxing authority, which, if
successful, might result in an indemnity payment to an Indemnified Party, then
such Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice of such claim (a "
_Tax Claim_ ") to the Indemnifying Party, provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice shall not limit the rights of the Indemnified Party to
recover under this Agreement except to the extent such failure shall have
materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

### (b) Subject to Section 9.3(c), with respect to any Tax Claim
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Selling Parties shall, solely at
their own cost and expense, control all proceedings and may make all decisions
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in their sole discretion pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in their sole discretion,
either pay the Tax claimed and

 

 

68    

 

 

sue for a refund where Applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the
Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_ , that the Selling Parties
shall not settle such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Purchaser,
and counsel of its own choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in
all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim (and the Selling
Parties shall keep Purchaser informed of all aspects of such Tax Claim and
shall consult with Purchaser before taking any significant action in
connection therewith) if such Tax Claim would reasonably be expected to have
an adverse impact on the Taxes of a Target Entity for a taxable period or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date or of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates. Purchaser shall be entitled to control a Tax Claim described in
this Section 9.3(b) to the extent the Selling Parties do not exercise their
right to control such Tax Claim.

 



 

### (c) Purchaser shall control all proceedings in connection
with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of a Target Entity for a Straddle Period;
_provided_ , that if such Tax Claim would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse impact on the Taxes of a Target Entity giving rise to Excluded Taxes,
then (i) Purchaser shall not settle any such Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of the Selling Parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (ii) the Selling Parties, and counsel of their own
choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the
prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim and (iii) Purchaser shall keep the
Selling Parties informed of all aspects of such Tax Claim and shall consult
with the Selling Parties before taking any significant action in connection
therewith.

### (d) Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control all
proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of a Target Entity
(other than any Tax Claim described in Section 9.3(b) and (c)).

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
procedures set forth in this Section 9.3, and not the provisions set forth in
Section 10.4, shall govern audits and administrative and judicial proceedings
with respect to Taxes.

 

Section 9.4 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, all documentary, sales, stamp, recording, use,
transfer (real estate or otherwise), registration and other such Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest thereon) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
imposed on the sale of the Purchased Equity pursuant to this Agreement (for
the absence of doubt, other than the actions contemplated in the Restructuring
which shall be paid by the Selling Parties) shall be paid 50% by each of
Purchaser and the Selling Parties. The Party upon which such Transfer Taxes
are imposed shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes.

 

Section 9.5 _Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, Purchaser and the
Selling Parties shall make available to the other, as reasonably requested,
and to any taxing authority in the event requested by the other, all
information, records or documents relating to Tax liabilities or potential Tax
liabilities of the Target Entities for all periods ending prior to or
including the Closing Date and shall preserve all such information, records,
and documents until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or
extensions thereof. Purchaser shall prepare and provide to the Selling
Parties any federal, state, local or foreign Tax information package requested
by a Selling Party or its Affiliate for their use in preparing the returns
required to be

 

 

69   filed by a Selling Party or an Affiliate of a Selling Party, provided that
such requested information package shall be consistent with the requesting
Selling Partys past practice or the past practice of its Affiliate, as the
case may be. Such Tax information packages shall be completed by Purchaser
and provided to each Selling Party by the later of sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date and sixty (60) days from the date such information packages are
requested by a Selling Party. Each Party will compensate the other for the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of providing information,
rendering assistance or preparing returns for taxable periods (or portions
thereof) for which the other is responsible. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement or any other agreement between Purchaser and any
Selling Party executed prior to the date hereof, neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any obligation to make available to any Selling
Party or its representatives, or provide any Selling Party or its
representatives with, any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return filed
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or its respective predecessors, or any
related work papers. 

 



 

Section 9.6 _Refunds_. Purchaser shall promptly pay or cause to be paid
to the applicable Selling Party any refund (reduced by the amount of any Taxes
(other than Excluded Taxes) arising or that would arise as a result of the
receipt of such refund or interest thereon) of Excluded Taxes (and interest
thereon) paid by any Selling Party (or any predecessor or Affiliate thereof),
which refund is received (or constructively received by way of reduction of a
current Tax amount otherwise payable) by Purchaser, any Affiliate of
Purchaser, or any Target Entity, but only to the extent that (i) such refund
is not reflected on the final Closing Statement, (ii) such refund is not the
result of an event that occurred after the Closing Date, and (iii) such refund
is not attributable to, and does not result from, a carry back or other use of
any item of loss, deduction, credit or other similar item arising in a Post-
Closing Tax Period or, in the case of a refund of Taxes for a Straddle Period,
the use of any such item arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period. The amount of
any other refund or Tax Benefit of any Target Entity shall be for the account
of Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax basis, net operating loss,
credit or other item that reduces Taxes paid or payable that may exist in any
Target Entity in a Post-Closing Tax Period or may be carried forward to a
Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Purchaser.

 

Section 9.7 _338 Elections_. Purchaser shall be entitled to make an
election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code and, if applicable, similar
elections under any applicable state or local law, with respect to any Target
Entity that is a Foreign Subsidiary (to the extent permissible by applicable
law) (a "338(g) Election"). Nothing in this Article IX or anywhere in this
Agreement shall be construed to prohibit Purchaser from making any such
election. Purchaser shall notify Seller of its intent to make a 338(g)
Election within 180 days after the Closing Date, provided that Seller shall
have provided Purchaser with all information reasonably requested by Purchaser
for purposes of determining whether to make such 338(g) Election.

 

Section 9.8 _Non-Resident Capital Gain Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold from the
purchase price or any other amount payable under this Agreement any amount
that Purchaser is required to withhold under applicable Tax law and any amount
that Purchaser would be required to pay under applicable Tax law in respect of
Non-Resident Capital Gain Taxes. Any amount so withheld shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid as purchase price under this
Agreement.

Section 10.1 _Survival_. Subject to Section 10.8, the Parties agree that
their respective representations and warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing.

severally, indemnify and hold harmless and defend Purchaser and its
Affiliates, including the Target Entities, and their respective stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively referred to herein as the " _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_ " and individually as a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties after the Closing as a result of or arising out of:

 

### (a) The falsity or incorrectness of or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Selling Parties in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered at the Closing to Purchaser by a Selling Party pursuant
to this Agreement (disregarding, in each case, for purposes of determining the
amount of any Loss (but not for purposes of determining whether there has been
a breach), any qualification on any such representation or warranty as to
materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect);

### (b) The failure by a Selling Party to perform any covenant
or agreement of such Selling Party under this Agreement or under any
certificate delivered at the Closing to Purchaser by a Selling Party pursuant
to this Agreement;

### (c) The failure by any Transferor (as defined in the
Contribution Agreements) to perform any covenant or agreement of such
Transferor required to be performed under the Contribution Agreements prior
to, on or following the Closing Date and the failure by any Transferee (as
defined in the Contribution Agreements) to perform any covenant or agreement
of such Transferee required to be performed under the Contribution Agreements
on or prior to the Closing Date;

### (d) Any Specified Liability; or

### (e) Any Excluded Tax.

 

Section 10.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the other
provisions of this Article X, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Selling Parties and each of their respective Affiliates, and each of their
respective stockholders, directors, officers, employees, representatives,
agents, successors and assigns (collectively referred to herein as the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ " and individually as a " _Seller Indemnified
Party_ ") from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by such
Seller Indemnified Party after the Closing as a result of or arising out of:

 

### (a) The falsity or incorrectness of or breach of any
representation or warranty of Purchaser in this Agreement or under any
certificate delivered at the Closing

 

 

71    

 

 

to a Selling Party by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement (disregarding, in
each case, for purposes of determining the amount of any Loss (but not for
purposes of determining whether there has been a breach), any qualification on
any such representation or warranty as to materiality);

 



 

### (b) The failure by Purchaser to perform any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser under this Agreement or under any certificate delivered
at the Closing to a Selling Party by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;

### (c) The failure by any Transferee (as defined in the
Contribution Agreements) to perform any covenant or agreement of such
Transferee required to be performed under the Contribution Agreements after
the Closing Date;

### (d) Any Assumed Liability; or

### (e) Any Non-Excluded Tax.

 

Section 10.4 _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification
by any Indemnified Party under this Article X shall be asserted and resolved
as follows:

 

### (a) _Third Party Claims_. If any claim or demand in
respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under this Article
X is asserted against such Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice (the " _Third
Party Claim Notice_ ") and the details thereof including an estimate of the
claimed Losses (if known and quantifiable), copies of all relevant pleadings,
documents and information to the Indemnifying Party within a period of thirty
(30) days following the assertion of the Third Party Claim against the
Indemnified Party (the " _Third Party Claim Notice Period_ "); _provided_ ,
that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party within the Third Party
Claim Notice Period shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party. Within ten (10) days after its receipt of the Third
Party Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall, in writing, either
acknowledge or deny its obligations to indemnify and defend under this Article
X.

### (b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligations
to indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim
within fifteen (15) days after having been notified by the Indemnified Party
of the existence of such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party, at
its sole cost and expense, shall defend such Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be diligently prosecuted;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle,
compromise, discharge or consent to an entry of judgment with respect to a
claim or liability subject to indemnification under this Article X without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying
Party may agree without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party to
any settlement, compromise, discharge or consent to an entry of judgment in
each case that by its terms (i) obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the
full amount of the liability in connection with such claim and that
unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all
liability

 

 

72    

 

 

or obligation in connection with such claim and (ii) does not impose
injunctive or other non-monetary equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates, or their respective businesses. The Indemnified
Party will cooperate fully in such defense, including by making available to
the Indemnifying Party all books, records and documents within the Indemnified
Partys control or that it can reasonably obtain relating to the Third Party
Claim, and all costs or expenses incurred by it at the request of the
Indemnifying Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified
Party may, at its cost and expense, at any time to prevent default or protect
its interests, file any pleadings or take any other action that the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests due to the failure of the Indemnifying Party to
diligently defend such Action. The Indemnified Party, at its expense, may
participate in, but not control (except as provided in the subsequent
paragraph), any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim conducted by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 10.4(b).

 



 

### (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (other
than Sections 9.3(e) and 10.4(e)), the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume control of such defense (unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by the Indemnified Party) and shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (1) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-
criminal proceeding, Action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (2) the
claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party;
(3) the Indemnifying Party fails to acknowledge its obligations to indemnify
and defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim within the
fifteen (15) day time period; (4) the named parties to any such suit, Action
or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, and in the reasonable judgment of outside
counsel to the Indemnified Party, representation of the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inadvisable due to actual
or potential differing defenses or conflicts of interests between them that
make joint representation inappropriate; or (5) upon petition by the
Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnifying Party
failed or is failing to take reasonable steps to diligently prosecute or
defend such Third Party Claim.

### (d) _Other Claims_. In the event any Indemnified Party
should have a claim under this Article X against any Indemnifying Party that
does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
give written notice (the " _Indemnity Notice_ ") and the details thereof,
including the amount, or an estimate, if known or reasonably determinable, of
the claimed Losses (if known and quantifiable), copies of all relevant
information and documents to the Indemnifying Party within a period of thirty
(30) days following the discovery of the claim by the Indemnified Party (the "
_Claim Notice Period_ "); _provided_ , that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party during the Claim Notice Period shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such
failure shall have actually and materially prejudiced such Indemnifying Party.
The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party within a period of
twenty (20) days after the receipt of the Indemnity Notice by the Indemnifying
Party whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party under this Article X with respect to such claim. If the Indemnifying

 

 

73    

 

 

Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such twenty (20) day period
that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party
under this Section 10.4(d), such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in
the Indemnity Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party under this Section 10.4(d) or, in the case of any notice in
which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such
later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes
finally determined.

 



 

### (e) _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding the above provisions of
this Section 10.4, the procedures set forth in Section 9.3, and not the
provisions set forth in the above provisions of Section 10.4, shall govern
audits and administrative and judicial proceedings with respect to Taxes.

 

Section 10.5 _Monetary Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

 (a) _Monetary Limitations on Selling Parties_. No amount of indemnity shall be payable by the Selling Parties in the case of a claim by any Purchaser Indemnified Party under Section 10.2(a) unless, until and only to the extent that such Purchaser Indemnified Party has suffered or incurred Losses consisting of actual damages aggregating in excess of Three Million Five Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($3,600,000) (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), whereupon such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to claim indemnification for the amount in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ , that in no event shall the aggregate indemnity amount payable by any Indemnifying Party under Section 10.2(a) exceed forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000) (the " _Cap Amount_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall make an indemnity claim under Section 10.2(a), either individually or together with other related indemnity claims, that does not exceed Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) in the aggregate (the " _De Minimis Amount_ ") for such claim or series of related claims. The limitations in this Section 10.5(a) shall not apply to recovery for an inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty contained in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6 or 4.19 nor, for the absence of doubt, shall they apply to recovery for any claim under Sections 10.2(b), (c), (d) or (e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the "Deductible Amount" for a claim by any Purchaser Indemnified Party under Section 10.2(a) that relates to an inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 4.8 shall be $1,000,000 whereupon such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to claim indemnification for all Losses incurred with respect to such inaccuracy or breach, including all amounts below and including such $1,000,000 Deductible Amount.

 

### (b) _Monetary Limitations on Purchaser_. No amount of
indemnity shall be payable by Purchaser in the case of a claim by any Seller
Indemnified Party under Section 10.3(a) unless, until and only to the extent
that such Seller Indemnified Party has suffered or incurred Losses consisting
of actual damages aggregating in excess of the Deductible Amount whereupon
such Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to claim indemnification for
the amount in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ , that in no event
shall the aggregate indemnity amount payable by any Indemnifying Party under
Section 10.3(a) exceed the Cap Amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no
Seller Indemnified Party shall make an indemnity claim, either individually or
together with other indemnity claims, that does not exceed the De Minimis
Amount. The limitations in this Section 10.5(b) shall not apply to recovery
for an inaccuracy in

 

 

74    

 

 

or breach of a representation or warranty contained in Section 5.2 nor, for
the absence of doubt, shall they apply to recovery for any claim under
Sections 10.3(b), (c), (d) or (e).

 



 

### (c) _Exchange Rate_. For purposes of determining whether a
Loss or all Losses suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party exceed the
Deductible Amount, the Cap Amount and the De Minimis Amount, the Parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that all calculations shall be made in USD and,
where necessary, shall be converted into USD using the Exchange Rate as of the
date that such Purchaser Indemnified Party delivers written notification to
the Selling Parties that such Purchaser Indemnified Party is making an
indemnity claim pursuant to the provisions of this Article X.

### (d) _Current Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Selling Parties shall have no obligation
to separately indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any amount of
Loss that is included as a Current Liability on the final Closing Statement
and specifically identified as such and is duly settled pursuant to Section
2.3.

##  Section 10.6 _Conduct of Environmental Remedial Action_.

## 

### (a) The Parties agree that, in addition to applicable
provisions of Section 10.4, this Section 10.6 shall govern the conduct of any
environmental investigation, clean-up, remediation and/or monitoring
activities at or relating to any Real Property ("Remedial Action") for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof.

### (b) The Selling Parties shall be entitled to assume
principal management of Remedial Action conducted hereunder, including the
actual conduct of the Remedial Action as well as any negotiations or
agreements with relevant Governmental Entities, subject to the conditions and
limitations herein. To assume principal management, the Selling Parties must
provide Purchaser, within 30 days of receiving Purchasers claim for
indemnification with respect to such Remedial Action, written assurances
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that (i) the Selling Parties intend to
undertake principal management of the Remedial Action and (ii) the Selling
Parties acknowledge that Purchaser is entitled to indemnification by the
Selling Parties in respect of the entirety of such claim. In the event the
Selling Parties elect not to undertake principal management, Purchaser shall
assume principal management (the party undertaking principal management to be
known as the " _Control Party_ "), subject to reimbursement by the Selling
Parties of Losses incurred in connection therewith promptly upon demand. The
Parties agree that the Control Party shall exercise the lead role in
determining, in its reasonable judgment, the scope, timing and extent of
Remedial Action and ensuring that such Remedial Action is completed in a
reasonably cost effective manner so as to achieve compliance with the
Applicable Remediation Standards. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Purchaser may take such action as is reasonable under the
circumstances to respond to an actual emergency or other situation arising at
the relevant property in which it would be unlawful or negligent for Purchaser
to take no action while waiting for the Selling Parties to address such
emergency or situation, and the costs of such action shall be included as
Losses indemnified pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof.

### (c) The Control Party shall commence Remedial Action promptly and
pursue it diligently in compliance with all Environmental Laws (defined for
this purpose as in effect at

 

 

75   the time of such Remedial Action). The Control Party shall perform, or
cause to be performed, the related Remedial Action until such time as it
achieves compliance with the Applicable Remediation Standards. 

 



 

### (d) In connection with the conduct of a Remedial Action
hereunder and the securing of a no further action determination, Purchaser
agrees to consent to, and undertake reasonable steps to facilitate the
implementation of, any institutional control, restriction or use limitation
(individually or collectively, an _"Imposition_ ") with respect to the Real
Property as long as the Selling Parties shall have first consulted with
Purchaser and then only if such Imposition would not unreasonably affect the
continued operations of the Business or anticipated future industrial use of
such Real Property or subject Purchaser to any material unreimbursed cost.
Purchaser shall promptly execute such documents identified by the Selling
Parties if such documents are reasonably necessary to effectuate an Imposition
which is imposed in accordance with the terms hereof.

### (e) To the extent any Selling Party is the Control Party,
Purchaser agrees to grant the Selling Parties and its authorized employees,
agents, representatives, consultants, contractors and subcontractors approved
in advance in writing by Purchaser acting reasonably, for such purpose,
(collectively the " _Environmental Representatives_ ") a non-exclusive and
limited right to enter the Real Property at reasonable times after providing
twenty-four hours advance notice solely for the purpose of performing the
Remedial Action at the Real Property subject to customary terms and conditions
for such access (including without limitation provisions relating to insurance
coverage, indemnification for damages caused by such access and Selling Party
responsibility for management and proper disposal in its own name of any
investigation residuals).

### (f) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Selling
Parties in performing the Remedial Actions for which they are the Control
Party, including providing space at the Real Property for the installation and
operation of any system necessary to implement such Remedial Actions provided
such installation and operation may not unreasonably interfere with operations
upon such Real Property. The Selling Parties shall obtain all consents
necessary to perform such Remedial Actions. In connection therewith, to the
extent available, Purchaser shall allow the Environmental Representatives the
reasonable use of existing utilities, including water and electrical power
necessary to operate such systems; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Selling
Parties shall reimburse Purchaser for such utility expenses to the extent they
can be reasonably ascertained or estimated.

### (g) The Selling Parties shall indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for all injuries or claims caused by the Remedial Action
conducted by Selling Parties and the Environmental Representatives pursuant to
this Section 10.6.

### (h) The Selling Parties in performing any action for which
they are the Control Party shall mutually use reasonable and diligent efforts
to accomplish the Remedial Action. Purchaser shall have the right to assume
principal management of any Remedial Action which (i) the Selling Parties fail
to commence promptly or, (ii)the Selling Parties have commenced performing as
the Control Party, and fail to diligently pursue to completion in compliance
with this Section 10.6 and Applicable Remediation Standards, if Purchaser
shall

 

 

76   have given the Selling Parties reasonable notice of, and a reasonable
opportunity to cure, such failure to diligence pursue. 

 



 

### (i) The Selling Parties and Purchaser agree to cooperate
reasonably with each other to effect the successful completion of the Remedial
Action and to negotiate in good faith to reach mutual agreement as to any
matters governed hereunder. However, subject to the Control Partys
obligations to communicate with and receive consents or approvals from the
non-Control Party as provided herein, the Parties agree that the Control Party
shall coordinate all communications with relevant Governmental Entities
regarding the Remedial Action (except to the extent communications by the
non-Control Party are reasonably necessary for or attendant to ordinary
course operations upon the subject Real Property). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the non-Control Party with respect to a particular
Remedial Action shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to reasonably
participate in the management of such Remedial Action. Such participation may
include: (i) the right to receive copies of all reports, work plans and
analytical data submitted to Governmental Entities, all notices or other
letters or documents received from Governmental Entities, any other
documentation and correspondence (except for privileged attorney-client
communications and documents protected by the work-product doctrine) material
to the claim, and notices of material meetings; (ii) the opportunity to attend
such material meetings; (iii) the right of reasonable consultation with the
Control Party. In addition, during the period the Selling Parties are the
Control Party, the Selling Parties shall give Purchaser reasonable advance
notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on (and such
comments shall be reasonably addressed and reflected in), material decisions
with respect to such Remedial Action. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit
a Party having a reporting obligation pursuant to any Law from fulfilling such
obligation.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. After the Closing, except in the case
of fraud, the sole and exclusive remedies for any Party with respect to any
claim relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
the facts and circumstances relating and pertaining hereto shall be governed
by this Agreement (whether any such claim shall be made in contract, breach of
warranty, tort or otherwise); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of a
breach of the Agreement that does not result in termination of the Agreement
by the non-breaching Party, the foregoing shall not limit the availability to
any Party hereof of injunctive and other equitable relief, including specific
performance.

 

Section 10.8 _Time Limits on Claims_. No claim or Action shall be brought
under this Article X hereto for breach of a representation or warranty more
than fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, or any other provision of this Agreement:

 

### (a) There shall be no time limitation on claims or Actions
brought for breach of any representation or warranty made in or pursuant to
Section 4.5 (Capitalization of the Subject Companies) or Section 4.6 (Good
Title Conveyed in the Purchased Equity).

### (b) Any claim pursuant to Section 4.16 (Environmental
Matters) may be brought at any time within three years after the Closing Date.

 

 

77    

 

 



 

### (c) Any claim or Action brought for breach of any
representation or warranty made in or pursuant to Section 4.18 (Employee
Benefits Plans) or 4.19 (Tax Matters) may be brought at any time until six (6)
months following the date that the underlying Tax obligation is barred by the
applicable statute of limitation under Applicable Laws relating thereto.

### (d) Any claim or Action brought for breach of any
representation or warranty made in or pursuant to Section 4.8 (Financial
Statements) may be brought at any time prior to January 31, 2013.

 

Any claim for breach of a representation or warranty not made within the
foregoing relevant time period shall expire and be forever barred thereafter.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants and agreements of the Selling
Parties set forth in Section 6.17 shall survive the Closing indefinitely;
_provided_ , that the obligation of the Selling Parties to deliver immaterial
Intellectual Property to the Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.17 shall survive
until the three year anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

No claim for any Excluded Tax or Non-Excluded Taxes may be brought after such
date that is six months following the date that the underlying Tax obligation
is barred by the applicable statute of limitation under Applicable Laws
relating thereto.

 

Section 10.9 _Insurance Proceeds_. The liability of the Indemnifying Party
with respect to any Loss shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds received
by the Indemnified Party as a result of any such Loss.

 

Section 10.10 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of Applicable Law),
Purchaser, the Selling Parties and their respective Affiliates shall treat any
and all indemnification payments under this Article X as an adjustment to the
Total Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. Except as provided in Section
2.2(a), any indemnification payments made by the Selling Parties under this
Article X shall be allocated to the applicable Purchased Equity which directly
or indirectly represents an ownership interest in the Subject Company that
gave rise to the Loss resulting in the indemnification payment.
