("NEWCO"), GENESCO INC., a Tennessee corporation ("PARENT"), and HAT WORLD

unexercised options to purchase Company Stock will be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as determined herein.   C.

an irrevocable proxy dated the date hereof (the "PROXIES") pursuant to which
such holders have agreed, among other things, to vote all his, her or its
shares of Company Stock in favor of the Merger.   D. The Company, Parent
and Newco desire to make certain representations and warranties and other
agreements in connection with the Merger.   E. Certain capitalized terms
used herein as defined terms are defined in Schedule 1 attached hereto.

State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required  by, and executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions  of, Section 251(c) of the Delaware
General Corporation Law  (the "DGCL") (the time of such filing with the
Secretary of  the State of Delaware, or such other later time as the
parties  mutually agree and set forth in the Certificate of Merger,  being
the "EFFECTIVE TIME"). The consummation of the  transactions contemplated
hereby (the "CLOSING") shall take  place at 10:00 a.m. at the offices of the
Company\'s counsel,  Barnes and Thornburg, in Indianapolis, Indiana on the
date  provided above, unless another date is agreed to in writing by  the
parties (the "CLOSING DATE").   SECTION 1.3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the
Effective  Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided under the 
DGCL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of  the foregoing,
at the Effective Time all the property, rights,  privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Newco  shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts,  liabilities and duties of the Company and Newco shall
become  the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving  Corporation.  
SECTION 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION; BY-LAWS.   (a) Unless otherwise
determined by Parent prior to the  Effective Time, at the Effective Time the
Certificate of Incorporation  of Newco as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be  the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until  thereafter amended as provided by Law and such Certificate
of  Incorporation.   (b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to
the  Effective Time, the by-laws of Newco as in effect immediately prior to 
the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation  until
thereafter amended.   SECTION 1.5 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The directors
and  committees of the Board of Directors (including the  composition
thereof) of Newco immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be the
initial directors and committees  of the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each  to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of 
Incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and  the officers of
Newco immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall be the
initial  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 3 INDS01 RKIXMILLER
644669v6     officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold 
office until their respective successors are duly elected or  appointed and
qualified.   SECTION 1.6 WARRANTS AND OPTIONS; EFFECT OF THE  MERGER ON THE
CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY.   (a) Prior to or concurrently with the
Closing, as  provided in this Section and in Section 4.7, all warrants,
options or  other rights to acquire Company Stock, other than conversion
rights  under outstanding preferred shares of Company Stock, shall be
either  exercised or cancelled, or, in the case of unexercised options
under  the Option Plan or otherwise, other property shall be substituted
for  the Common Stock issuable upon the exercise thereof as set forth in
the  following sentence. In that regard, prior to the Closing, the Company 
will take appropriate action to elect to substitute the right to  receive the
per share Merger Consideration payable to holders of Common  Stock, instead
of the right to purchase shares of Common Stock, with  respect to all
outstanding options to purchase Common Stock granted  under the Company\'s
2001 Stock Option Plan (the "OPTION PLAN") that  have not been exercised
prior to the taking of the Company\'s actions in  that regard and may by
agreement effect that same result with respect  to options issued and held
outside the Option Plan (in either case, the  unexercised options as to which
the per share Merger Consideration is  substituted for the right to purchase
shares of Common Stock are the  "SUBSTITUTED OPTIONS"). Each Substituted
Option will be cashed out  rather than exercised, and the holder thereof (an
"OPTION HOLDER") will  not be obligated to pay the exercise price thereunder
upon exercise  (but may defer payment of the exercise price thereof), and
upon  submission of a Request for Payment pursuant to Section 1.10 will be 
entitled to receive the per share Merger Consideration payable to  holders of
Common Stock (excluding Dissenting Shares) as to that number  of shares
potentially acquirable under the Substituted Option (the  "SUBSTITUTED OPTION
SHARES") minus the exercise price otherwise payable  under such Substituted
Options and less any applicable tax  withholdings. Accordingly, holders of
Substituted Options will not be  entitled to receive certificates for shares
of Common Stock under those  options but instead will be entitled after the
Effective Time to share  in the Merger Consideration with respect to each of
the Substituted  Option Shares as to which their Substituted Options have
been  exercised, net of the exercise price of such options and applicable
tax  withholdings. The Company will provide to Parent and Newco in 
accordance with Section 1.9 a current list as of the Closing of all  Option
Holders and, as to each Option Holder, the number of Substituted  Option
Shares represented by his or her Substituted Options and the  applicable
exercise price with respect thereto.   (b) At the Effective Time (a) each
share of Company Stock  (other than Dissenting Shares and treasury or other
shares held by the  Company) and each Substituted Option Share will be
converted into the  right to receive, payable upon surrender of the
certificates formerly  representing shares of Company Stock by the holders
thereof in the  manner provided in Section 1.10 and, with respect to
Substituted Option  Shares, upon the submission of a Request for Payment by
the Option  Holder with respect thereto in accordance with Section 1.10,
that  portion of the Merger Consideration payable by Parent (through the 
Paying Agent and, as applicable, through the Stockholder Committee, the 
Working Capital Escrow Agent and the Indemnification Escrow
Agent),  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 4 INDS01 RKIXMILLER
644669v6     without interest, to the holders thereof at the times and in
the  amounts determined pursuant to Sections 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 hereof, (b) 
any treasury shares or other shares held by the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries will be canceled and (c) notwithstanding anything in this 
Agreement to the contrary, no Dissenting Shares will be deemed to be 
converted into and to represent the right to receive cash as  contemplated by
this Agreement (including Sections 1.8 and 1.9) and the  holders of
Dissenting Shares, if any, will be entitled to payment,  solely from the
Surviving Corporation, of the appraised value of such  Dissenting Shares to
the extent permitted by and in accordance with the  provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if  any holder of Dissenting Shares,
under the circumstances permitted by  the DGCL, subsequently delivers a
written withdrawal of his or her  demand for appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares, (ii) if any holder  fails to establish his or her entitlement to
rights to payment as  provided in such Section 262, or (iii) if neither any
holder of  Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation has filed a
petition  demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares
within  the time provided in such Section 262, such holder will forfeit
such  right to payment for such Dissenting Shares pursuant to such Section 
262 and, as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of  such
event, such holder\'s certificate formerly representing shares of  Company
Stock shall automatically be converted into and represent only  the right to
receive that portion of the Merger Consideration payable  by Parent (through
the Paying Agent and, as applicable, through the  Stockholder Committee, the
Working Capital Escrow Agent and the  Indemnification Escrow Agent) at the
times and in the amounts  determined by Sections 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 hereof,
without any interest  thereon, upon surrender of the certificates formerly
representing such  shares of Company Stock.   SECTION 1.7 EFFECT OF THE
MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK  OF NEWCO. Each share of common stock of Newco
issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at 
the Effective Time, be converted into one validly issued,  fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate of Newco  evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to  evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the 
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.8 MERGER CONSIDERATION.   (a) AMOUNT
PAYABLE. Subject to the adjustments to be made  pursuant to Section 1.9 with
respect to any Dissenting Shares, the  aggregate consideration payable to the
holders of Company Stock and  Substituted Options in connection with the
Merger is the sum of (i) One  Hundred Sixty-Five Million Dollars
($165,000,000), plus (ii) the  amount, if any, by which Closing Cash exceeds
Closing Debt, minus (iii)  the amount, if any, by which Closing Debt exceeds

estimated and final  working capital adjustments described in Sections 1.8(b)
and 1.8(c),  and plus (v) Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) with respect to
the  Stock Option Benefits (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). The Merger 
Consideration will be paid by Parent (and Parent will receive refunds  of
overpayments, if applicable) as follows:  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE

upon the termination of the Working  Capital Escrow Agreement to be
distributed pursuant to the  terms thereof and Sections 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 to
the former  holders of Company Stock (excluding Dissenting Shares) and to 
Option Holders who have surrendered their Certificates or  submitted a
Request for Payment pursuant to Section 1.10;   (ii) the sum of Fifteen
Million Dollars  ($15,000,000.00) will be paid by Parent at Closing to the

remaining upon the  termination of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement to
be  distributed pursuant to the terms thereof and Sections 1.8,  1.9 and
1.10 to the former holders of Company Stock (excluding  Dissenting Shares)
and to Option Holders who have surrendered  their Certificates or submitted a
Request for Payment pursuant  to Section 1.10;   (iii) the sum of One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000)  will be paid by Parent at Closing to the
Stockholder Committee  (as the agent of the former holders of Company Stock 
(excluding Dissenting Shares) and the Option Holders who have  surrendered
their Certificates or submitted a Request for  Payment pursuant to Section
1.10) to be received, held and  disbursed pursuant to the authority of such
agent described in  Exhibit C hereto;   (iv) the sum of One Hundred Forty-
Three Million  Dollars ($143,000,000) (the "BASE CLOSING CASH") plus (A)
the  amount, if any, by which Closing Cash exceeds Closing Debt,  minus (B)
the amount, if any, by which Closing Debt exceeds  Closing Cash, plus (C) the
Estimated Working Capital Excess  determined pursuant to Section 1.8(b), or
minus (D) the  Estimated Working Capital Deficiency determined pursuant to 
Section 1.8(b), as applicable, and plus (E) Three Million  Dollars
($3,000,000) with respect to the Stock Option Benefits  (the "CLOSING MERGER
CONSIDERATION"), will be paid by Parent  at Closing as follows: (x) an amount
equal to the Stock Option  Withholding will be paid by Parent to the Company
or retained  by Parent for timely payment by the Company or Parent, as 
applicable (and Parent shall cause the Company to make such  payment if
Parent does not make it), of the Stock Option  Withholding to the appropriate
taxing authorities on behalf of  the Persons from whom such amounts are
withheld (provided,  that the Company shall cooperate with Parent prior to
the  Closing to assist Parent in making or causing to be made such  payment
on the Closing Date), (y) the aggregate exercise price  for all Substituted
Option Shares will be retained by Parent  and/or paid by Parent to the
Surviving Corporation, as Parent  shall elect, and (z) the balance thereof
will be paid by  Parent to the Paying Agent for payment to the former
holders  of Company Stock (excluding Dissenting Shares) and to the  Option
Holders upon surrender of their Certificates or  submission of a Request for
Payment pursuant to Section 1.10;  and  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 6
INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6    (v) any Final Working Capital Excess
determined  pursuant to Section 1.8(c) will be paid by Parent to the  Paying
Agent within ten (10) Business Days after the amount  thereof has been
determined for distribution to the former  holders of Company Stock
(excluding Dissenting Shares) and to  the Option Holders who have surrendered
their Certificates or  submitted a Request for Payment pursuant to Section
1.10.   (b) ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT. At least five  Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to  Parent in
writing its good faith estimate of the Closing Working  Capital, which shall
include the accounts set forth on Exhibit G hereto  (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING
WORKING CAPITAL"). The Company shall make  available to Parent all work
papers and other books and records  utilized in calculating the Estimated
Closing Working Capital and shall  use its reasonable efforts to make
available to Parent the appropriate  personnel involved in the preparation of
such estimate. The amount, if  any, by which the Estimated Closing Working
Capital is less than the  applicable Target Closing Working Capital is the
"ESTIMATED WORKING  CAPITAL DEFICIENCY", and the amount, if any, by which the
Estimated  Closing Working Capital is greater than the Target Closing
Working  Capital is the "ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL EXCESS". The amount 
determined under this Section 1.8(b) shall be added or subtracted, as 
applicable, to the Base Closing Cash in order to determine the cash  amount
payable by Parent at Closing under Section 1.8(a), clause (iv).   (c) POST-
CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT; OTHER  ADJUSTMENTS. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than  sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, the Stockholder Committee shall  notify Parent in writing of its final
determination of the Company\'s  actual (rather than estimated) Closing
Working Capital and of any  disagreement with the amounts used by the parties
at Closing as the  Company\'s Closing Cash and Closing Debt (which
notification is the  "COMMITTEE\'S REPORT"), which determination shall set
forth in  reasonable detail the Stockholder Committee\'s calculation of
Closing  Working Capital and, if applicable, Closing Cash and/or Closing
Debt.  The Committee\'s Report shall also set forth, and explain in
reasonable  detail, any differences between the Stockholder Committee\'s
calculation  of Closing Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Working
Capital. A  copy of all work papers and other books and records utilized in
the  preparation of the Committee\'s Report shall be made available to
Parent  at such time. Parent will notify the Stockholder Committee in
writing  (the "WORKING CAPITAL DISPUTE NOTICE"), within the later of (i)
thirty  (30) days after receiving the Committee\'s Report and (ii) sixty
(60)  days following the Closing Date, if Parent disagrees with the 
Stockholder Committee\'s calculation of the Closing Working Capital as  set
forth in the Committee\'s Report and/or if Parent disagrees with the 
accuracy of the Closing Cash or Closing Debt amounts used at Closing to 
calculate the Merger Consideration, which notice shall set forth in 
reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement(s), the amounts  involved
and Parent\'s calculation of the Closing Working Capital or, if  applicable,
Closing Cash and/or Closing Debt. If no Working Capital  Dispute Notice is
received by the Stockholder Committee within such  period, the Stockholder
Committee\'s calculation of Closing Working  Capital as set forth in the
Committee\'s Report and the amounts of  Closing Cash and Closing Debt used at
the Closing to calculate the  Merger Consideration shall be final and binding
upon the parties  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 7 INDS01 RKIXMILLER
644669v6    hereto. The Stockholder Committee and Parent will give each
other and  their representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to  the personnel, books and records of the Surviving Corporation to
assist  the Stockholder Committee in the preparation of the Committee\'s
Report  and to assist Parent in the preparation of any Working Capital
Dispute  Notice.   (d) Upon receipt by the Stockholder Committee of a 
Working Capital Dispute Notice, the Stockholder Committee and Parent  shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement with respect  to Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash and/or Closing Debt set forth  in the Working
Capital Dispute Notice. To the extent Parent and the  Stockholder Committee
are unable to agree with respect to all such  matters within thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Stockholder  Committee of the Working Capital Dispute
Notice, Parent and the  Stockholder Committee shall promptly submit the
unresolved issues as to  the proper amount of the Closing Working Capital,
Closing Cash and/or  Closing Debt for a binding determination to a nationally
recognized  accounting firm that is mutually acceptable to the Stockholder 
Committee and Parent. Such accounting firm may consider only items  disputed
by the Working Capital Dispute Notice and matters affected  thereby, and its
determination of the Final Closing Working Capital  shall not be more than
the Closing Working Capital set forth in  Committee\'s Report or less than
the Closing Working Capital set forth  in the Working Capital Dispute Notice.
The amount of the Closing  Working Capital plus or minus, as applicable, any
appropriate  adjustments on account of changes to Closing Cash and/or Closing
Debt,  as agreed upon by the Stockholder Committee and Parent, as deemed 
agreed upon pursuant to the next-to-last sentence of Section 1.8(c), or  as
determined by such accounting firm in accordance herewith, shall be  the
"FINAL CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL". The fees and expenses of such  accounting
firm shall be paid by the party (either the Stockholder  Committee or Parent)
whose latest written offer or position as to an  acceptable amount for the
Closing Working Capital at the time the issue  is submitted to such
accounting firm is furthest away from the Final  Closing Working Capital as
determined by such accounting firm.   (e) If the Final Closing Working
Capital is greater than  the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the amount
equal to the  difference between the two (the "FINAL WORKING CAPITAL EXCESS")
shall  be paid by Parent to the Paying Agent within ten (10) Business Days 
after the determination of such amount for distribution to the former 
holders of Company Stock (excluding Dissenting Shares) and to the  Option
Holders who have surrendered their Certificates or submitted a  Request for
Payment pursuant to Section 1.10. If the Final Closing  Working Capital is
less than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the  amount equal to the
difference between the two (the "FINAL WORKING  CAPITAL DEFICIENCY") shall be
paid by the Working Capital Escrow Agent  (and by the Indemnification Escrow
Agent from the funds held by such  agent under Indemnification Escrow if and
to the extent the funds held  by the Working Capital Escrow Agent are not
sufficient) on behalf of  the former holders of Company Stock and Substituted
Options to Parent  within ten (10) Business Days after the amount of the
Final Working  Capital Deficiency has been determined.   (f)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, the computation
of Estimated Closing Working Capital, Target  Closing Working
Capital,  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 8 INDS01 RKIXMILLER
644669v6     Closing Working Capital and Final Closing Working Capital
shall not  include or reflect the impact of any change to the balance sheet 
resulting from any Tax deduction or other Tax benefit to which the  Company
may be entitled as a result of the exercise by any optionee of  any option to
purchase Common Stock or as a result of the realization  of any other
benefits with respect to which the optionee is entitled  pursuant to the
Option Plan, in either case after December 31, 2003  (collectively, the
"STOCK OPTION BENEFITS"). (This Section is not  intended to limit the
Company\'s ability to reflect the non-Tax impact  of the exercise of the
options and issuance of shares of Common Stock  pursuant thereto on its
balance sheet.)   (g) As contemplated by Section 1.9(f), Parent shall 
timely pay or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to timely pay on  behalf
of the Persons as to whom the Company has tax withholding  obligations any
applicable withholding taxes payable with respect to  the exercise by any
optionee of any option to purchase Common Stock or  the realization of any
other benefit to which the optionee is entitled  pursuant to the Option Plan
or with respect to options to purchase  Common Stock outside the Option Plan
(the "STOCK OPTION WITHHOLDING")  and shall deduct the amount of the Stock
Option Withholding from the  Closing Merger Consideration payable to the
Paying Agent pursuant to  Section 1.8(a)(iv).   SECTION 1.9 ALLOCATION AND
PAYMENT OF MERGER  CONSIDERATION.   (a) At the Closing the Company will
provide to Parent a  document prepared by the Company and signed by the Chief
Financial  Officer of the Company (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION PAYMENT
ALLOCATION")  that will list all holders of Company Securities as of the
Closing  (names and addresses), that will reflect the type and number of
shares  of Company Securities held by each of them, and that will reflect,
as  determined pursuant to the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation,
this  Agreement and applicable law, the amount and/or proportion, on a per 
share basis, of each component of the Merger Consideration payable or 
potentially payable to each holder of Company Securities (excluding 
Dissenting Shares but including, without limitation, Substituted Option 
Shares) by Parent, the Paying Agent, the Working Capital Escrow Agent  and
the Indemnification Escrow Agent. The provisions of this Section  1.9 will be
followed in preparing the Merger Consideration Payment  Allocation.   (b)
(i) If any former holder of Company Stock delivers a  written demand for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, an  amount allocable to the
shares of Company Stock held by such holder and  deposited pursuant to the
Working Capital Escrow Agreement or the  Indemnification Escrow Agreement or
deposited with the Stockholder  Committee or with the Paying Agent (each a
"Disbursement Account")  shall be segregated and held separate pending a
determination with  respect to whether such holder is entitled to rights to
payment  pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If such holder\'s rights to
payment  pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL has been forfeited pursuant to 
Section 1.6(b) of this Agreement, such funds shall no longer be  segregated
and shall be disbursed in accordance with the terms of  Sections 1.6, 1.8 and
1.9. If it is determined that such holder is  entitled to rights to payment
as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL or  if no such determination has been
made at the time all nonsegregated  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 9
INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6     amounts in the applicable Disbursement
Account have been or are being  disbursed, the amounts allocable to such
holder\'s Dissenting Shares  shall be disbursed to the Company.   (ii) The
amount of funds deposited into a Disbursement Account  allocable to such a
holder\'s shares shall be an amount equal to (A) the  amount of funds
deposited in such Disbursement Account (less any  amounts payable from such
Disbursement Account to Parent or the  Surviving Corporation or other third
parties and, in the case of funds  deposited with the Paying Agent, the
$1,000,001 preference amount  payable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and plus, in the case of  the Disbursement Account with the Paying Agent, the
amount of the  exercise price for any Substituted Option and any Stock
Option  Withholding withheld therefrom by Parent or paid to Parent, the
Company  or the Surviving Corporation) divided by (B) the number of shares
of  Common Stock of the Company as of the Closing Date viewing all Company 
Securities on an as-converted, as-exercised basis (and including, for  this
purpose, all Substituted Option Shares, shares underlying  Substituted
Options and Dissenting Shares, but excluding any treasury  shares or shares
otherwise held by the Company).   (c) The holders of the Company\'s Series A
Preferred Stock  outstanding as of the Closing as a group will be entitled to
receive  $5.27082 per share, or an aggregate total of One Million One
Dollars  ($1,000,001), of the Merger Consideration as a preferential amount 
payable to such holders under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock  as
set forth in the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation.   (d) The balance
of the Merger Consideration, after  adjustment on account of Dissenting
Shares (if any) and after  subtracting the $1,000,001 preference amount
payable to the holders of  Series A Preferred Stock, will be payable prorata
(subject to Section  1.9(e) and 1.9(f)) according to their respective shares
of Common Stock  (or deemed ownership of Common Stock) to the holders of
Company  Securities as of the Closing other than Dissenting Shares, viewing
all  Company Securities on an as-exercised and as-converted basis;
provided,  however, that if the Series B-1 Liquidation Preference (as defined
in  the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation) is greater than the per 
share Merger Consideration payable to the holders thereof such holders  shall
instead be entitled to receive an amount equal to the Series B-1  Liquidation
Preference for each share of Common Stock into which such  holder\'s Series
B-1 Preferred Stock is convertible, and if the Series  B-2 Liquidation
Preference (as defined in the Company\'s Certificate of  Incorporation) is
greater than the per share Merger Consideration  payable to the holders
thereof such holders shall instead be entitled  to receive an amount equal to
the Series B-2 Liquidation Preference for  each share of Common Stock into
which such holder\'s Series B-2  Preferred Stock is convertible, and the
amounts payable to the other  holders of Company Securities pursuant to this
Section 1.9(d) will be  reduced accordingly. Such payment will occur at the
various times and  from the various sources (such as the Paying Agent and the
escrow  agents referred to herein) as described in this Agreement.   (e)
Under the Option Plan, participants who exercise  options in anticipation of
the Merger have the right to defer payment  of the exercise price for their
shares of Common Stock so acquired  until the consummation of the Merger. The
Company may grant similar  rights to the holders of options that have been
issued outside the  Option  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 10 INDS01
RKIXMILLER 644669v6     Plan. With respect to any such participants or
option holders who have  exercised options but who have not paid the exercise
price in full for  any of their shares of Common Stock acquired from the
Company, the  Paying Agent shall, as provided on the Merger Consideration
Payment  Allocation (but only to the extent such amounts were not withheld
by  Parent from its payments to the Paying Agent), pay directly to the 
Company out of sums otherwise payable to such Persons the unpaid  exercise
price payable by them to the Company with respect to their  shares of Common
Stock and shall pay to each such Person only the net  remaining amount
payable to such Person after deducting amounts paid to  the Company on behalf
of such Person pursuant to this Section 1.9. With  respect to the holders of
Substituted Options, the amount payable to  the holders of Substituted Option
Shares shall also be only the net  amount payable to such Persons after
deducting the exercise price that  would otherwise be payable by them with
respect to their Substituted  Option Shares.   (f) The Company will have
tax withholding obligations  with respect to certain of its employees or
former employees who  exercise stock options or whose options are cashed out
without being  exercised. If, prior to the Closing, the Company has not
effected such  tax withholdings with respect to option holders who have
exercised  options or who will be receiving Merger Consideration with respect
to  Substituted Option Shares, the taxes required to be withheld from each 
of said Persons will be deducted from the Merger Consideration  otherwise
payable to them, and will be paid (or caused to be paid) by  Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to the appropriate taxing  authorities as withheld
taxes on their behalf as provided in this  Agreement, and they will be
entitled to receive the amounts of Merger  Consideration otherwise payable to
them hereunder after deducting any  such withheld tax amounts.   SECTION
1.10 PAYMENT AND SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) Simultaneous with the
Effective Time, Parent will  furnish to SunTrust Bank, N.A. (the "PAYING
AGENT") sufficient funds  for the payment of the Closing Merger
Consideration, and Parent will  cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise
provide (i) a letter of  transmittal (with instructions for its use) in the
form attached hereto  as Exhibit D to each record holder of outstanding
Company Stock (other  than Dissenting Shares) as of the Closing, and (ii) a
Request for  Payment of Merger Consideration in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit  E (a "REQUEST FOR PAYMENT") to each holder of Substituted Options as
of  the Closing, for each holder to use in surrendering against payment of 
the Closing Merger Consideration the certificates which represented  his, her
or its shares of Company Stock other than Dissenting Shares  and/or in
requesting payment of the per share amount of the Closing  Merger
Consideration with respect to Substituted Option Shares held by  such
holder.   (b) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the  certificates
representing shares of Company Stock (the "CERTIFICATES")  other than
Dissenting Shares, or upon submitting to the Paying Agent a  signed Request
for Payment with respect to Substituted Option Shares  and to certain other
participants under the Option Plan who have  previously exercised options,
the Certificates so surrendered shall  forthwith be cancelled and payment of
the Closing Merger Consideration  will be made by the Paying Agent (and
any  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 11 INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6    
other portion of the Merger Consideration not then payable will be paid  as
contemplated hereby) to the holders of surrendered Certificates and  to the
Option Holders who submit a Request for Payment with respect to  each
Substituted Option Share designated therein in accordance with the  terms of
this Agreement, or to the Company in payment of the unpaid  exercise price
payable upon the exercise of options under the Option  Plan and/or applicable
tax withholdings in connection therewith, in the  amounts determined under
Section 1.9. Until so surrendered, each  outstanding Certificate or right
thereto shall be deemed, from and  after the Effective Time, to represent
solely the right to receive upon  such surrender payment of the Merger
Consideration, without interest,  at the times and in the amounts determined
pursuant to this Article 1.   (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or  destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person  claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
satisfactory  to Parent and complying with any other reasonable requirements
imposed  by Parent, Parent will cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, 
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Closing Merger Consideration (and  as
applicable all other sums included in the Merger Consideration as  such sums
become payable to holders of Company Stock other than  Dissenting Shares) for
each share represented thereby; provided,  however, that Parent may not
require the owner of such lost, stolen or  destroyed Certificate to give
Parent a bond or other financial  instrument or collateral but may require a
written indemnity against  any claim that may be made against Parent with
respect to the  Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   SECTION 1.11 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY  STOCK.
All payments of the Merger Consideration made upon  surrender of Certificates
for Company Stock in accordance with  the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been made in full  satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of  Company Stock, and there shall be no further registration of  transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of  shares of Company Stock which
were outstanding as of the  Closing. If, after the Closing, Certificates are
presented to  the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be 
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 1.   SECTION 1.12
STOCKHOLDER COMMITTEE. There is hereby  created and established a committee
of two (2) persons  appointed by holders of Company Stock who were
stockholders of  the Company prior to the Effective Time (the "STOCKHOLDER 
COMMITTEE"), one member of which shall be appointed (and may  be removed and
replaced) by HWorld Investments, LLC, a  Delaware limited liability company,
and one member of which  shall be appointed (and may be removed and replaced)
by  Bluestem Capital Company, LLC. The Stockholder Committee shall  have the
power and authority to act for all purposes under  this Agreement on behalf
of all of the former stockholders of  the Company who as of the Closing held
shares of Company Stock  (other than Dissenting Shares) and all Option
Holders. The  initial members of the Stockholder Committee, who shall be 
members thereof until they are replaced as provided herein,  are F. Barron
Fletcher, III and Steve Kirby. Written notice of  a replacement of a member
of the Stockholder Committee shall  be given by the Person entitled to
appoint such member to  Parent and to the other Person entitled to appoint a
member of  the Stockholder Committee. Each former  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER PAGE 12 INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6     stockholder of the Company
and Option Holder shall be deemed  at the Effective Time to have irrevocably
appointed the  Stockholder Committee, and each of the members thereof, as 
his, her or its attorney-in-fact and agent to act for such  stockholder or
Option Holder within the scope of the authority  given to the Stockholder
Committee as described in Exhibit C  attached hereto and made a part hereof,
including, without  limitation, the authority to receive, invest, spend and 
distribute the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to  the
Stockholder Committee pursuant to Section 1.8(a), clause  (iii). Parent and
Newco shall be entitled to rely on the  written instructions of the
Stockholder Committee and shall be  protected from any liability of any kind
for actions taken in  reliance upon such written instructions.   SECTION
1.13 EBITDA LOSS ADJUSTMENT.   (a) As used herein:   (i) "LEASE CONSENT
COST" means any amount the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries pays or agrees
to pay in  order to obtain a Lease Consent from a landlord under a Lease 
other than an Excluded Lease, either prior to the Closing or  at any time
after the Closing prior to the end of the 210th  day following the Closing
Date (whether such amount is paid or  payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at, prior to  or after the Closing). If such amount is a one
time payment,  the Lease Consent Cost shall be the amount of such payment.
If  such amount is more than one payment (such as increased rent),  the
Lease Consent Cost shall be the sum of such payments  becoming payable during
the remaining term of the Lease and,  if applicable, any renewal or extension
periods available to  the tenant as a matter of right without a renegotiation
of the  rent or other terms applicable under the Lease;   (ii) "OTHER LEASE
INCREASE COST" means any amount  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
required to pay or  otherwise agrees to pay under any Lease as a result of
the  occurrence of the Merger that (i) would not have been owed had  the
Merger not occurred and (ii) is not a Lease Consent Cost.  If such amount is
a one time payment, the Other Lease Increase  Cost shall be the amount of
such payment. If such amount is  more than one payment (such as increased
rent), the Other  Lease Increase Cost shall be the sum of such payments
becoming  payable during the remaining term of the Lease and, if 
applicable, any renewal or extension periods available to the  tenant as a
matter of right without a renegotiation of the  rent or other terms
applicable under the Lease; and   (iii) "LOST LEASE COST" means 3.5 times
the Store  EBITDA reflected on Exhibit H hereto with respect to any  Leases
that (i) are terminable by the landlord thereunder as a  result of the Merger
and (ii) are in fact so terminated by  such landlord not later than 210 days
after the Closing Date.   (b) If any Lease Consent Cost or Other Lease
Increase  Cost is paid or accrued (but as to the amount accrued only to the 
extent included as a current liability in Closing  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER PAGE 13 INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6     Working Capital) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior  to the Closing, there shall
be added as an asset of the Company for  purposes of calculating Closing
Working Capital (and to Estimated  Closing Working Capital to the extent
known) an amount equal to the  lesser of (i) the aggregate amount of such
Lease Consent Costs and  Other Lease Increase Costs paid or accrued (but as
to the amount  accrued only to the extent included as a current liability in
Closing  Working Capital) and (ii) the Excess EBITDA Amount. If the
aggregate  amount of the Lease Consent Costs and Other Lease Increase Costs
paid  or accrued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to
the  Closing is less than the amount of the Excess EBITDA Amount, the 
difference shall be referred to as the "Unused Excess EBITDA Amount."  If the
aggregate amount of the Lease Consent Costs and Other Lease  Increase Costs
paid or accrued by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Closing is more than the amount of the  Excess EBITDA Amount, the difference
shall be referred to as the "Price  Reduction Amount." If the Price Reduction
Amount is more than $5  million, Parent shall further increase the Closing
Working Capital by  such excess paid or accrued by the Company (but as to the
amount  accrued only to the extent included as a current liability in
Closing  Working Capital) and shall pay such amount to the Paying Agent at
the  time the Closing Merger Consideration is paid or, to the extent not 
then known, at the time the Final Closing Working Capital is  determined.  
(c) If any Lease Consent Cost or Other Lease Increase  Cost is not paid or
accrued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  at or prior to the Closing
or if there is any Lost Lease Cost, Parent  shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the funds held by the  Indemnification Escrow Agent under
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement  an amount equal to the amount by which
the sum of such Lease Consent  Costs, Other Lease Increase Costs and Lost
Lease Costs exceeds any  Unused Excess EBITDA Amount; provided, however, that
the amount Parent  may so receive shall not exceed $5 million minus the Price
Reduction  Amount. The procedures set forth in Section 6.4(a) shall apply to
a  claim for reimbursement under this Section as if it were a claim for 
indemnification to which Section 6.4(a) is applicable. (The Deductible 
limitation in Section 6.2(b) is not applicable to any such claim for 
reimbursement under this Section.)   (d) The amount of any Lease Consent
Cost or Other Lease  Increase Cost shall be determined on a "cash on cash"
basis.   SECTION 1.14 LEASE CONSENTS.   (a) With respect to Leases other
than Excluded Leases,  the provisions of this Section shall be applicable in
connection with  the efforts of the parties to obtain Lease Consents.   (b)
Prior to the Closing the Company may obtain Lease  Consents on such economic
terms as the Company shall approve under the  provisions of this Section and
without the approval or consent of  Parent or Newco so long as the aggregate
Lease Consent Cost and Other  Lease Increase Cost (the "AGGREGATE PRE-CLOSING
CONSENT COSTS") with  respect to those Leases as to which the Company has
obtained Lease  Consents does not exceed the Excess EBITDA Amount. If the
Aggregate  Pre-Closing  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 14 INDS01
RKIXMILLER 644669v6     Consent Costs equal or exceed (or would exceed if
increased as a result  of a proposed Lease Consent) the Excess EBITDA Amount,
then the Company  shall not incur any additional Aggregate Pre-Closing
Consent Costs to  obtain additional Lease Consents without the advance
written consent of  Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or  delayed by Parent. If Parent has not disapproved in writing
the form  and/or terms of any proposed Lease Consent within ten (10) days 
following written notice thereof, Parent shall be deemed to have  consented
in writing to the form and terms thereof. In addition,  anything to the
contrary herein notwithstanding, in no event shall the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries agree to any non-economic terms or  conditions in connection
with any Lease Consents without the prior  written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed by
Parent.   (c) After the Closing and prior to the end of the 210th  day
following the Closing Date Parent and the Surviving Corporation may  incur or
agree to incur Lease Consent Costs and Other Lease Increase  Costs in
connection with obtaining Lease Consents only with the advance  written
approval of the Stockholder Committee (which approval shall not  be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by the Stockholder  Committee)
and the costs so incurred shall be subject to the provisions  of Section
1.13. If the Stockholder Committee has not disapproved in  writing such costs
within ten (10) days following written notice  thereof, the Stockholder
Committee shall be deemed to have consented in  writing to such costs. Any
such costs incurred or agreed to be incurred  by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation without the written approval of  the Stockholder Committee shall
be at the expense of Parent or the  Surviving Corporation and shall not be
subject to the provisions of  Section 1.13.   (d) In connection with
obtaining Lease Consents as to  which the advance consent or approval of the
other party as to the  terms thereof is not required under this Section, each
of the Company,  the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall exercise
reasonable business  judgment in good faith with a view toward minimizing, to
the extent  reasonably practicable, the costs to be borne by the other party
(which  after the Closing is meant to refer to the Persons entitled to share
in  the Merger Consideration being held by the Indemnification Escrow 
Agent) under Section 1.13.   (e) Any damages allegedly resulting from a
breach of the  covenant made in Section 1.14(d) shall be considered an
indemnification  claim against the allegedly breaching party subject to the
provisions  of Article 6.   (f) Each of the Company and Parent shall,
during the  period of time that they are obtaining Lease Consents subject to
the  provisions of this Section and Section 1.13, furnish a weekly report
to  the other party (which will be the Stockholder Committee after the 
Closing) as to the Lease Consents obtained since the prior weekly  report and
the terms agreed to in connection therewith, and shall  otherwise furnish the
other party from time to time with all other  information reasonably
requested concerning the efforts made to obtain  Lease Consents.  ARTICLE
2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER PAGE 15 INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6     The Company hereby

Material Adverse Effect. Except as  set forth in Section 2.4, the Company has
no Subsidiaries or  equity investments in any other Person. The only U.S.

expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect, the Company need not give any
notice  to, make any filing with, or obtain any authorization,  consent, or
approval of any Government Authority in order to  consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  The affirmative vote of the shares of
capital stock of the  Company owned by the Controlling Stockholders and
subject to  the Proxies will be sufficient to approve the Merger in 
accordance with the requirements of the DGCL and the Company\'s  Certificate

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or  (iii) violate or conflict

the Audited Financial  Statements, the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Financial
Statements have  been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied consistently
with prior  periods, and present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated  financial position and consolidated results of operations of
the  Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods 
indicated; provided however, that the unaudited interim financial  statements
are subject to normal year-end adjustments and lack  footnotes and other
presentation items (which, if presented, would not  differ materially from
those included in the Audited Financial  Statements).   (b) The Company and
its Subsidiaries maintain accurate  books and records reflecting their assets
and liabilities and maintain  proper and adequate internal accounting

the notes  thereto, the Company does not have any liabilities or obligations
of  any nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and 
whether due or to become due (including, without limitation,  liabilities for
taxes and interest, penalties and other charges payable  with respect

in  Schedule 2.7 hereto, there is no Action pending, or to the  Knowledge of
the Company threatened, against the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries,
before or by any court or other  Government Authority. The matters listed on
Schedule 2.7 could  not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse  Effect. There is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or  order of
any court or governmental body specifically  applicable to the Company or any
Subsidiary. To the Knowledge  of the Company neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is  subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of  any court or governmental body of general applicability, that  in any
such case (i) would  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 19 INDS01 RKIXMILLER
644669v6     require a change in the manner in which the Company or any 
Subsidiary presently conducts its business and (ii) which  change could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect. There is not
pending against the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries any Action (i)
seeking to restrain or prohibit  the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement, or (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit the
ownership  or operation by the Surviving Corporation of any portion of  the
assets or business of the Company or its Subsidiaries.   SECTION 2.8
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS; CONSENTS.   (a) Except as disclosed in
Schedule 2.8, the Company and  its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Laws, except for  such non-compliance as reasonably could not be
expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The Company and its
Subsidiaries own, or have full  rights under, all licenses, permits and
authorizations of any  Government Authority which are necessary for the
conduct of their  business as currently conducted, except for any such
licenses, permits,  consents and authorizations that, if not so held,
reasonably could not  be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the  foregoing is in full force and effect, and the Company and its 
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all of their obligations with  respect
thereto, with such exceptions as reasonably would not be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 2.9 TITLE TO ASSETS. The Company and
its  Subsidiaries have good title to, or valid and existing leases  or
licenses for, all of the assets used by them or required  for use in their
business operations or included in the most  recent Financial Statements

Company has knowledge that arises  hereafter if, had it existed or occurred
on or prior to the  date hereof, such matter would have been required to be
listed  or described on a Schedule to this Agreement or would have 
constituted a breach of a representation or warranty of the  Company, or
(b)  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 34 INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6    
any matter of which the Company has knowledge, the disclosure  of which is

connection therewith shall nevertheless be  limited as follows:   (i)
first, no Losses (A) arising out of the  breach of any representation or
warranty of the Company  contained or made in this Agreement or the breach of
Section  4.11, or (B) relating to Taxes for any period ending on or  prior
to the Closing Date (or any indemnification obligation  relating to any of
the foregoing), shall be payable until the  total of all such Losses exceeds
One Million Dollars  ($1,000,000) (the "DEDUCTIBLE"), and then only the
excess  amounts above the Deductible shall be payable; and  AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 40 INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6    (ii) second, the only
available source of payment  for any Losses (A) arising out of the breach of
any  representation or warranty of the Company contained or made in  this
Agreement or the breach of Section 4.11, or (B) relating  to Taxes for any
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date  (or any indemnification
obligation relating to any of the  foregoing) shall be the funds held by the
Indemnification  Escrow Agent that have not yet become distributable to the 
former holders of Company Stock (excluding Dissenting Shares)  and to Option
Holders under the terms hereof and/or the  Indemnification Escrow Agreement.
The former stockholders of  the Company and the members of the Stockholder
Committee,  individually or as a group, shall not have any personal 
liability for the payment of any indemnification obligations  hereunder.  
SECTION 6.3 STOCKHOLDER INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) From and after the Closing,
and subject to Section  6.1 and this Section 6.3, including the limitations
herein, Newco and  Parent hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and
hold  harmless the former stockholders of the Company and the Option
Holders  and their directors, officers and employees (each a "STOCKHOLDER 
INDEMNIFIED PERSON" and, collectively, the "STOCKHOLDER INDEMNIFIED 
PERSONS") (a Parent Indemnified Person or a Stockholder Indemnified  Person,
as applicable, are referred to herein as an "INDEMNIFIED  PERSON") for, from
and against any Losses arising out of (i) the breach  of any representation
or warranty of Newco or Parent contained in or  made pursuant to this
Agreement, (ii) the breach by Newco or Parent of,  or the failure by Newco or
Parent to perform, any of its or their  covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, or (iii) any  obligation or liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which  is included in the Financial
Statements or in the calculation of Final  Closing Working Capital. For
purposes of this Section 6.3, any breach  of any representation, warranty or
covenant shall be determined without  regard to any materiality or material
adverse effect qualification.   (b) If any Stockholder Indemnified Person
becomes  potentially entitled to any indemnification arising out of the
breach  of any representation or warranty of Newco or Parent contained or
made  in this Agreement (or any indemnification obligation relating
thereto)  pursuant to Section 6.3(a) of this Agreement, the amount that
such  Stockholder Indemnified Person is entitled to recover in connection 
therewith shall nevertheless be limited as follows:   (i) first, no Losses
arising out of the breach  of any representation or warranty of Newco or
Parent contained  or made in this Agreement (or any indemnification
obligation  relating thereto) shall be payable until the total of all such 
Losses exceeds the Deductible, and then only the excess  amounts above the
Deductible shall be payable; and   (ii) second, the aggregate limit of
Parent\'s and  Newco\'s liability for all Losses arising out of the breach
of  any representation or warranty of Newco or Parent contained or  made in
this Agreement (or any indemnification obligation  relating thereto) shall be
limited to $15,000,000.00.  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 41 INDS01
RKIXMILLER 644669v6      SECTION 6.4 PROCEDURES.   (a) An Indemnified
Person that has (or believes that it  has) a claim for indemnification under
this Article 6, other than a  claim for indemnification that involves a Third
Party Claim, shall give  written notice to Parent or the Stockholder
Committee (as the  representative of the former stockholders of the Company
(other than  Dissenting Shares) and Option Holders), as applicable (each,
an  "INDEMNIFYING PARTY", as applicable) (a "CLAIM NOTICE"), requesting 
indemnification and describing in reasonable detail to the extent then  known
the nature of the indemnification claim being asserted by the  Indemnified
Person, providing therein an estimate of the amount of  Losses attributable
to the claim to the extent feasible (which estimate  may be but shall not
necessarily be conclusive of the final amount of  such claim), and also
providing therein the basis for and factual  circumstances surrounding the
Indemnified Person\'s request for  indemnification under this Article 6. The
Indemnifying Person shall,  within thirty (30) days after its receipt of a
Claim Notice, notify the  Indemnified Person in writing as to whether the
Indemnifying Person  admits or disputes the claim described in the Claim
Notice. If the  Indemnifying Person gives written notice that it admits the 
indemnification claim described in such Claim Notice, then the  Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the  provisions of
this Article 6, and subject to the limitations hereof,  with respect to the
estimated amount of Losses stated in the Claim  Notice. If the Indemnifying
Person notifies the Indemnified Person in  writing that it disputes such
claim for indemnification, or that it  admits the entitlement of the
Indemnified Person to indemnification  under this Article 6 with respect
thereto but disputes the amount of  the Losses in connection therewith, or if
the Indemnifying Person fails  to notify the Indemnified Person within such
thirty (30) day period  that it either admits or disputes such claim for
indemnification, then  in either of such cases the indemnification claim
described in the  Claim Notice shall be a disputed indemnification claim that
must be  resolved by settlement between the Indemnified Person and the 
Indemnifying Person, or by proceedings commenced in an appropriate  court of
competent jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying Person or  the Indemnified
Person, or by any other mutually agreeable method.  Payment of all amounts
determined pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) to be  owed to a Parent
Indemnified Person shall be made by the  Indemnification Escrow Agent, upon
the written instruction for the  making of such payment by both the
Stockholder Committee and Parent,  within ten (10) days after (i) the making
of a binding settlement  approved by the Stockholder Committee and Parent, or
(ii) the  expiration of all appeal rights from a final adjudication of a
court of  competent jurisdiction with respect thereto, or (iii) the final
and  nonappealable determination of such liability and amount by any other 
resolution method undertaken pursuant to the mutual written agreement  of the
Parent and the Stockholder Committee. Payment of all amounts  determined
pursuant to this Section 6.4(a) to be owed to a Stockholder  Indemnified
Person shall be made by Parent within ten (10) days after  (i) the making of
a binding settlement approved by the Stockholder  Indemnified Person, the
Stockholder Committee and Parent, or (ii) the  expiration of all appeal
rights from a final adjudication of a court of  competent jurisdiction with
respect thereto, or (iii) the final and  nonappealable determination of such
liability and amount by any other  resolution method undertaken pursuant to
the mutual written agreement  of the Stockholder Indemnified Person, the
Parent and the Stockholder  Committee.  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE
42 INDS01 RKIXMILLER 644669v6      (b) If a claim is asserted against an
Indemnified Person  by a person other than a party to this Agreement and is
based on  factual allegations which, if true, would entitle the Indemnified 
Person to indemnification under Section 6.2(a) and (b) taken together  or
6.3(a) and (b) taken together (any such claim is a "THIRD PARTY  CLAIM"), the
Indemnified Person against whom the Third Party Claim is  asserted shall give
written notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE") to the  Indemnifying Person of the
assertion of such Third Party Claim,  describing in such notice in reasonable
detail to the extent then known  the nature of the Third Party Claim and the
factual basis and  circumstances surrounding same and estimating the amount
of Losses  attributable to such Third Party Claim to the extent feasible
(which  estimate shall not be conclusive of or binding as to the final
amount  of such indemnification claim). A copy of all papers served on or 
received by the Indemnified Person with respect to such Third Party  Claim,
if any, shall be attached to the Claim Notice. The failure of an  Indemnified
Person to properly deliver a Claim Notice to the  Indemnifying Person shall
not defeat or prejudice the indemnification  rights under this Article 6 of
such Indemnified Person with respect to  the related Third Party Claim unless
and except to the extent that the  resulting delay is materially prejudicial
to the defense of the Third  Party Claim or the amount of Losses associated
therewith. Within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of any Claim Notice with
respect to a  Third Party Claim (the "ELECTION PERIOD"), the Indemnifying
Person  shall notify the Indemnified Person who provided the Claim Notice
in  writing that the Indemnifying Person either (i) disputes the right of 
the Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article 6 with  respect
to that Third Party Claim, or (ii) admits the right of the  Indemnified
Person to indemnification under this Article 6 with respect  to Losses
arising in connection with that Third Party Claim. The  failure of the
Indemnifying Person to respond to the Indemnified Person  within such fifteen
(15) day period after receipt of a Claim Notice by  the shall be deemed to
constitute a response by the Indemnifying Person  that it denies the right of
such Indemnified Person to indemnification  under this Article 6 with respect
to that Third Party Claim.   (c) If the Indemnifying Person admits that an
Indemnified  Person is entitled to indemnification under this Article 6 with
respect  to a Third Party Claim, then in such event (i) the Indemnifying
Person  shall vigorously defend the Third Party Claim with counsel approved
by  the Indemnified Person (which approval shall not be unreasonably 
withheld), and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not enter into any 
settlement of the Third Party Claim unless such settlement is approved  in
writing by the Indemnified Person (which approval may not be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed). (If the Stockholder Committee is the  Indemnifying
Person defending a Third Party Claim, the costs and  expenses of such defense
shall be payable by (or the Stockholder  Committee shall be entitled to
reimbursement therefor upon demand to)  the Indemnification Escrow Agent from
the funds held pursuant to the  Indemnification Escrow Agreement, and Parent
and the Stockholder  Committee shall each so instruct the Indemnification
Escrow Agent in  writing to that effect.) If the Indemnifying Person disputes
the right  of the Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article 6
with  respect to the Third Party Claim described in a Claim Notice, then in 
such event (i) the Indemnified Person may defend the Third Party Claim  with
counsel of its choice and may enter into a settlement thereof  without
seeking or obtaining approval of the Indemnifying Person as to  counsel
employed or for the making of such settlement, and (ii) the  amount of Losses
incurred by  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 43 INDS01 RKIXMILLER
644669v6     the Indemnified Person in connection with such Third Party
Claim, and  the Indemnified Person\'s right to indemnification under this
Article 6  with respect thereto, shall be a disputed indemnification claim to
be  resolved by settlement between the Indemnifying Person and the 
Indemnified Person, or by appropriate proceedings in any court of  competent
jurisdiction. Payment of all amounts determined pursuant to  this subsection
(c) to be owed to a Parent Indemnified Person shall be  made by the
Indemnification Escrow Agent, upon the written instruction  for the making of
such payment by both the Stockholder Committee and  Parent, within ten (10)
days after (i) the making of a binding  settlement approved in writing by the
Stockholder Committee and the  Parent Indemnified Person, or (ii) the
expiration of all appeal rights  from a final adjudication of a court of
competent jurisdiction with  respect thereto, or (iii) the final and
nonappealable determination of  such liability and amount by any other
resolution method undertaken  pursuant to the mutual written agreement of the
Stockholder Committee  and the Parent Indemnified Person. Payment of all
amounts determined  pursuant to this subsection (c) to be owed to a
Stockholder Indemnified  Person shall be made by Parent, within ten (10) days
after (i) the  making of a binding settlement, or (ii) the expiration of all
appeal  rights from a final adjudication of a court of competent
jurisdiction  with respect thereto, or (iii) the final and nonappealable 
determination of such liability and amount by any other resolution  method
undertaken pursuant to the mutual written agreement of Parent  and the
Stockholder Indemnified Person.   SECTION 6.5 EXCLUSIVE POST-CLOSING REMEDY.
After the Closing, and except for any non-monetary, equitable relief to which
any Indemnified Person may be entitled, the rights and remedies set forth in
this Article 6 shall constitute the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of
the Indemnified Persons under or with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement is intended to
limit any right of any Person with respect to a common law fraud claim
against another Person.   SECTION 6.6 LIABILITY LIMITATIONS. In no event
shall any Indemnified Person be, under or in respect of this Agreement (but
not with respect to matters appropriately pursued outside of the provisions
of this Agreement), entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages.
Additionally, Parent, Newco and the Company hereby waive as to each former
officer and director of the Company, from and after the Closing, any and all
claims and any causes of action for monetary damages under or with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement (other than any claims or causes of
action arising out of the express provisions of this Article 6) or any breach
or alleged breach of fiduciary obligation by such officer or director to the
Company that Parent, Newco or the Company might otherwise be entitled to
assert against any such former officer or director, including under any
Law.  ARTICLE 7. TERMINATION AND REMEDIES   SECTION 7.1 TERMINATION OF
AGREEMENT. Subject to Section 8.4  hereof, either of the Company and Parent
may terminate this Agreement  with the prior authorization of its board of

thereof to the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time (i) in  the
event the Company has breached any representation, warranty or covenant 
contained in this Agreement in any material respect, Parent has notified the

cure for a period of thirty (30) days after the notice of breach was given 
to the Company, or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 
April 30, 2004, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under 
Section 5.1 hereof unless such failure results primarily from Newco or 
Parent breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this 
Agreement;   (c) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving 
written notice thereof to Parent at any time prior to the Effective Time (i) 
in the event Newco or Parent has breached any representation, warranty or 
covenant contained in this Agreement in any material respect, the Company

without cure for a period of thirty (30) days after the notice of breach was 
given to Parent, or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 
April 30, 2004, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under 
Section 5.2 hereof unless such failure results primarily from the Company 
breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this 
Agreement;   (d) either the Company or Parent may terminate this  Agreement
by giving written notice to the other at any time after the  Special Meeting,
as adjourned or postponed, in the event this Agreement and  the Merger fail

Agreement by giving written notice to the other, if any court of competent 
jurisdiction or other Government Authority shall have permanently enjoined, 
restrained or otherwise prohibited the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby and such injunction, restraint or prohibition shall have 
become final and nonappealable, provided that the party seeking to terminate 
this Agreement shall have used reasonable efforts to prevent and remove such 
injunction, restraint or prohibition;   (f) the Company may terminate this
Agreement by giving  written notice thereof to Parent if the Board of
Directors of the Company  determines that it will not recommend approval of

withdrawn) based upon  the advice of outside counsel that such action is
necessary for the Board of  Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to
stockholders under  applicable law;   (g) Parent may terminate this
Agreement by giving written  notice thereof to the Company if the Company has
within the five previous  Business Days given Parent any notice pursuant to
Section 4.11 and the  matter that is the subject of the notice results in (i)
the Company being in  breach in any material respect of any covenant
contained in  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER PAGE 45 INDS01 RKIXMILLER
644669v6     this Agreement or (ii) the representations and warranties of

respect; or   (h) Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written 
notice thereof to the Company if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company 
shall have determined to not recommend or shall withdraw, modify or change 
its recommendation relating to the Merger in a manner materially adverse to 
Parent, or (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have recommended 
to the stockholders of the Company that they accept or approve, or the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have agreed to engage in, a
