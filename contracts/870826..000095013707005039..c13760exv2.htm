request. 

   

 5.4 _Non-Compete_. In partial consideration for entering into this Agreement for the sale of the NBC Company Interest, NBC agrees, with the Buyer that, for a period (the " _Restricted Period_ ") equal to twelve (12) months following the date hereof, NBC and its Affiliates will not, without the prior written consent of the Buyer in its sole discretion, directly or indirectly, alone or in association with or on behalf of any other Person enter into any arrangement, business, understanding, commitment, agreement or venture with respect to running a business similar in any material respect to that of the Company (i.e., a joint venture for the distribution or sale of premium lifestyle products online) with any of the Persons or brands listed on _Exhibit B_ hereto (or their successors or subsidiaries) (collectively, the " _Competing Persons_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall limit the right of NBC or its Affiliates to (x) collectively own not more than an aggregate of 20% of any of the debt or equity securities of any Person or (y) enter into any arrangement for advertisement in the ordinary course of business between the Seller or any of its Affiliates and any Competing Person. NBC and the Buyer agree that the provisions of this Section 5.4 are an integral part of this Agreement and that the Buyer would not be entering into this Agreement without the provisions of this Section 5.4 If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 5.4 is invalid or unenforceable, NBC and the Buyer agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope or duration of such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. NBC and the Buyer recognize and agree that immediate irreparable damages for which there is not adequate remedy at law would occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 5.4 are not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or are otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that in the event of a failure by NBC or the Buyer to perform its obligations under this Section 5.4, the nonbreaching party shall be entitled to specific performance through injunctive relief, without the necessity of posting a bond, to prevent breaches of the provisions and to enforce specifically the provisions of this Section 5.4 in addition to any other remedy to which such party may be entitled, at law or in equity. 

   

 5.5 _Non-Solicitation; No-Hire_. As a separate and independent covenant, in partial consideration of entering into this Agreement for the sale of the Seller Company Interests, each Seller agrees, as to itself and its Affiliates, during the Restricted Period, it will not, alone or in association with or on behalf of any other Person, in any way, directly or indirectly, call upon, solicit, or hire as an employee, director, manager, consultant, officer, agent, representative or advisor any (i) executive officer of the Company or any other employee of the Company who, as of the date hereof is eligible to make through base salary and potential bonuses an aggregate of $150,000 or more per annum or (ii) of the individuals listed on _Exhibit C_. The foregoing restrictions shall not  ##### 

 

 

8

solicitations of employment published in a newspaper, over the internet, or
in another publication of general circulation and not specifically directed
towards such persons. 

   

 5.6 _Confidentiality_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees, solely as to itself and its Affiliates, that it may be in possession of confidential information concerning the Company and the other parties hereto and their respective businesses (the " _Confidential Information_ ") (each party receiving information, a " _Recipient_ " and each party disclosing Confidential Information, a " _Disclosing Party_ "); provided that Confidential Information shall not include any such information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such Recipient in violation of this provision, (ii) was or becomes available to such Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other then the Company or its representatives; _provided_ , that to the best of such Recipients knowledge such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to such Recipient by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, or (iii) is independently developed by such Recipient without violating such Recipients obligations hereunder. Each Recipient agrees, solely as to itself, that from and after the date hereof until the third anniversary of the date hereof, it shall, and that it shall cause its Affiliates and advisors (" _Representatives_ ") to keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and not to use Confidential Information for any purpose. Each Recipient acknowledges and agrees, solely as to itself and its Representatives, that the Confidential Information is proprietary and confidential in nature and may be disclosed to its Representatives only to the extent necessary for such Recipient and such Representatives to fulfill its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , that such Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of those confidentiality provisions by such Recipients Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.6 will be deemed to prohibit or limit the use, disclosure or retention of any Confidential Information by (a) the Company or ValueVision to and only to the extent that such Person is permitted to use, disclose or retain such Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of the Services Agreement or (b) any public disclosure permitted or made in accordance with Section 6.13. If, following the date hereof, a Recipient or any of its Representatives are legally required to disclose (after such Recipient has used its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid such disclosure) any of the Confidential Information (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), to the extent practicable, such Recipient shall, or shall cause its Representatives to, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or remedy is not obtained, such Recipient or its Representative may disclose only that portion of the restricted Confidential Information which such Person is legally required to disclose, and such Recipient shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information so disclosed. Each Recipient further agrees, solely as to itself, that, from and after the date hereof, such Recipient and its Representatives, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, shall promptly destroy the portion of all information and documents constituting or containing Confidential Information and shall certify such destruction to the Disclosing Party,  ##### 

 

 

9   

provided, however that each Recipient shall be permitted to keep one copy of
all information and documents constituting or containing Confidential
Information with legal counsel.

The Sellers each hereby agree that neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, use or exploit the Company name or any "Polo" and "Ralph Lauren" brand or derivation thereof or any other intellectual property that is or has been provided or licensed to the Company under the License Agreement (collectively, " _Polo IP_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.7 shall not apply (x) in the context of a separate commercial relationship between the Buyer and any of the Sellers, such as an advertising relationship and (y) with respect to ValueVision, the use of such intellectual property solely in accordance with the terms of the Service Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, NBC shall promptly and, in any event, within thirty days of the date hereof, change its name to remove the reference to "Lauren" from its name and such new name shall not contain any reference to any Polo IP. 

   

ARTICLE VI MISCELLANEOUS
