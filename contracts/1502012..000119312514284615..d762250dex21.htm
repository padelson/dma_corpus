Units whether or not they exchange their Partnership Common Units,
Partnership Class B Units and Partnership Class C Units pursuant to _Section
3.3_. At the Effective Time, the unit transfer books of the Partnership will
be closed immediately and there will be no further registration of transfers
on the unit transfer books of the Partnership with respect to Partnership
Common Units, Partnership Class B Units and Partnership Class C Units.

 

3.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to
act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Partnership
Units for the Merger Consideration or Cash Consideration as required by this
_Article III_ (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the applicable Partnership Units, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_, through the Exchange Agent, New Common
Units and cash as required by this _Article III_. Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and to make payments
in lieu of any fractional New Common Units pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, in
each case without interest. Any cash (including as payment for any fractional
New Common Units in accordance with _Section 3.3(d)_ and any distributions
with respect to such fractional New Common Units in accordance with _Section
3.3(c)_) and New Common Units deposited with the Exchange Agent are

 



19  hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent will,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions from Parent, deliver the Merger
Consideration and Cash Consideration contemplated to be paid for Partnership
Units pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by _Sections 3.3(c)_ and _3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund will not
be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Partnership
Units as of the Effective Time (other than the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries) (i) a letter of transmittal
(specifying that in respect of certificated Partnership Units, delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which will
be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the
Effective Time) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions (in
customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the
Effective Time) for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Units in exchange for the Merger Consideration or Cash
Consideration payable in respect of Partnership Units represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Units, as applicable. Promptly after the Effective
Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents (including in respect of Book-Entry Units)
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, (A) each holder
who held Partnership Common Units or Partnership Class B Units immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
and Parent and its Subsidiaries) will be entitled to receive upon surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Units therefor (x) New Common Units
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of New Common Units that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ (after
taking into account all Partnership Common Units or Partnership Class B Units
then held by such holder) and (y) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of the cash that such holder has the right to receive with respect to
such Partnership Common Units or Partnership Class B Units pursuant to
_Section 3.3(c)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_, and (B) each holder who held
Partnership Class C Units immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries) will be
entitled to receive upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units
therefor a check in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Cash
Consideration, if any, payable in respect of such Partnership Class C Units
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, Cash
Consideration, any cash payment in lieu of fractional New Common Units, any
Parent distributions payable pursuant to  _Section 3.3(c)_ or any Regular
Distribution. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Partnership Units
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Partnership, the Merger
Consideration or Cash Consideration, as applicable, and any Parent
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ payable in respect of such
Partnership Units may be paid to a transferee, if the Certificate representing
such Partnership Units or evidence of ownership of the Book-Entry Units is
presented to the Exchange Agent, and in the case of both certificated and
book-entry Partnership Units, accompanied by all documents reasonably required
to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange
will pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration or Cash Consideration,
as applicable, in 

 



20  any name other than that of the record holder of such Partnership Units, or
will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have
been paid or are not payable. Until such required documentation has been
delivered and Certificates, if any, have been surrendered, as contemplated by
this _Section 3.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit will be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such delivery and surrender the Merger Consideration or Cash Consideration, as
applicable, payable in respect of Partnership Units, and any cash or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_,
_Section 3.3(d)_ and (without the necessity of such surrender) Regular
Distributions.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Partnership Common Units and
Partnership Class B Units_. No distributions declared or made with respect
to Parent Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time will be
paid to the holder of any Partnership Common Units or Partnership Class B
Units with respect to New Common Units that such holder would be entitled
to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
New Common Units will be paid to any such holder until such holder has
delivered the required documentation and surrendered any Certificates
or Book-Entry Units as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_. Subject to
applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of _Section
3.3(b)_, there will be paid to such holder of New Common Units issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional New Common
Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.3(d)_ (which
shall be paid by the Exchange Agent as provided therein) and the amount of
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to New Common Units and payable with respect to such New Common
Units, and (ii) promptly after such compliance, or, if later, at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such delivery and surrender and a payment
date subsequent to such compliance payable with respect to such New Common
Units (which shall be paid by Parent).

(d) _Fractional New Common Units_. No certificates or scrip of New Common
Units representing fractional New Common Units or book entry credit of the
same will be issued upon the surrender of Partnership Common Units or
Partnership Class B Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_, and such fractional interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any New
Common Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Partnership Common Units or Partnership Class B Units converted in
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
New Common Unit (after taking into account all Partnership Common Units and
Partnership Class B Units exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the
Closing Date and (ii) the fraction of a New Common Unit that such holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As
promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any,
to be paid to holders of fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



21 (e) _Further Rights in Partnership Common Units_.

 

(i) The Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of a Partnership Common
Unit or Partnership Class B Unit in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_) and any declared
distributions to be paid on Parent Common Units as described in _Section
3.3(c)_ will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Partnership Common Unit or Partnership Class B Unit.

(ii) The Cash Consideration paid upon conversion of a Partnership Class C
Unit in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Partnership Class C Units.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Partnership Units after 180 days
following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by Parent
and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Partnership Units who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will thereafter look
only to Parent for the Merger Consideration or Cash Consideration, as the case
may be, payable in respect of such Partnership Units, any cash in lieu of
fractional New Common Units to which they are entitled pursuant to  _Section
3.3(d)_, or any distributions with respect to New Common Units to which they
are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Partnership Units
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any governmental entity will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, be held by Parent. Without limitation of the
foregoing, after 180 days following the Effective Time any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Partnership Units will become the property of Parent,
subject to the legitimate claims of any Person previously entitled thereto
under abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in such amount
reasonably determined by Parent, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration or Cash Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect
of Partnership Units represented by such Certificate, any distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ and any
cash payable in lieu of fractional New Common Units to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_.

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent are
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Partnership Units such amounts or
securities as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent reasonably deems to be
required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment or
issuance; _provided, however_ , that the Exchange Agent will provide
reasonable notice to the 

 



22  applicable holders of Partnership Units prior to deducting and withholding
any amounts or securities pursuant to this _Section 3.3(h)_. To the extent
that amounts or securities are so deducted and withheld such amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid or issued to
the holder of Partnership Units in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

(i) _Book Entry and Admission of Holders of New Common Units as Additional
Limited Partners of Parent_. All New Common Units to be issued in the Merger
will be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates. Upon the
issuance of New Common Units to the holders of Partnership Common Units and
Partnership Class B Units in accordance with this  _Section 3.3_, and the
compliance by such holders with the requirements of the Parent Agreement,
which requirements may be satisfied by each holder of New Common Units by the
execution and delivery by such holder of a completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal, Parent GP will be deemed to have automatically consented to the
admission of such holder as a limited partner of Parent in respect of its New
Common Units and will reflect such admission on the books and records
of Parent.

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis, in Parents
sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment or loss
thereon affects the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to
the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to the other provisions of this _Section
3.3_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be
paid promptly to Parent.

 

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger and Cash Received_. The Partnership and
Parent each acknowledges and agrees that for federal income Tax purposes the
transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement will be treated as an
"assets-over" partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby the Partnership will be
the terminating partnership and Parent will be the resulting partnership. As a
result, the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a contribution of all of the
assets of the Partnership to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
the cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units and the
assumption of liabilities. To the maximum extent possible, any cash received
in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units shall be treated as a reimbursement
of preformation capital expenditures described in Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-4(d). To the extent the any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Units exceeds the amount that can be so treated, such excess cash will
be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale transaction described in Section
707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a " _Disguised Sale_ "). Each holder of Partnership
Class C Units will be deemed to have consented for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (and to the extent applicable, state or local income tax purposes)
to report the Cash Consideration received in the Merger as proceeds from the
sale of the holders Partnership Class C Units to Parent consistent with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(c)(4). Each of the Partnership and Parent
agrees to prepare and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in accordance
with the foregoing and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith on
any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Laws following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other final administrative decision by an
applicable Governmental Authority.

 



23 3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. Without limiting the covenants in  _Sections
4.1_ and _4.2_ , in the event the outstanding Partnership Units or Parent
Common Units shall have been changed into a different number of units or a
different class after the date of this Agreement by reason of
any subdivisions, reclassifications, splits, unit distributions, combinations
or exchanges of Partnership Units or Parent Common Units, the Exchange Ratio
will be correspondingly adjusted to provide to the holders of such Partnership
Common Units and Partnership Class B Units the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

3.5 _Treatment of Awards under the Partnership LTIP_. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any award of Partnership Common Units issued under the
Partnership LTIP that is subject to vesting or forfeiture conditions ("
_Partnership Restricted Units_ "), that is subject to time-based vesting and
that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become
fully vested and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and such
Partnership Restricted Units shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ on the terms applicable to
issued and outstanding Partnership Common Units. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any award of performance units with respect to Partnership
Common Units that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Partnership Performance Units_ " and, together with the Partnership
Restricted Units, " _Partnership Equity Awards_ ") will, automatically and
without action on the part of the holder thereof, vest and be settled in a
number of Partnership Common Units determined based on actual attainment of
the applicable performance goal(s) as of two Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, and such resulting Partnership Common Units shall be converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ on the terms applicable to other issued and
outstanding Partnership Common Units.

 

3.6 _Treatment of Contingent Partnership Class B Units_. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, a number of Contingent Class B Units issuable upon a
Change of Control transaction (as used in Section 7.4 of the Existing
Partnership Agreement) equal to the Adjusted Class B Amount automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall vest and be
issued, the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and such issued
Contingent Class B Units shall be treated as issued and outstanding
Partnership Class B Units as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
otherwise subject to the terms of this Agreement applicable to issued and
outstanding Partnership Class B Units. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Adjusted Class B Amount_ " equals (x) 6,748,067 _minus_ (y) the excess of
(A) the number of Partnership Common Units issued in respect of the
Partnership Performance Units in accordance with _Section 3.5_ over (B)
383,900 and _minus_ (z) the number, if any, of Contingent Class B Units
issued pursuant to Section 7.4(d) of the Existing Partnership Agreement.

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTNERSHIP

circumstance or that such item has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Partnership (a " _Partnership Material Adverse Effect_ ")), the Partnership
represents and warrants to Parent as follows: __

30 (b) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth above in this
_Section 5.2_, (A) there are no partnership interests, limited liability

except pursuant to this Agreement, and (C) there are no contractual
obligations of the Partnership or any of its respective Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any partnership interest or other
equity interest in the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or any such
securities or agreements listed in _clause (B)_ of this sentence.

(c) Neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,

reorganization or other similar Law affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally or by general equitable principles).

 

5.5 _No Violations or Defaults_. Subject to required filings under federal and
state securities laws and with the NYSE, assuming the other consents and
approvals contemplated by _Section 5.6_ and _Article VIII_ are duly obtained
and assuming the consents, waivers and approvals specified in _Section
7.9(a)_ are obtained, the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by the

would become a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance required by, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise,
lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation
to which the Partnership or any of its respective Subsidiaries is a party or

with the rules of the NYSE, (D) such filings and approvals as may be required

unavailability of which would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger.

5.7 _Financial Reports and the Partnership SEC Documents_.

(a) Since January 1, 2013, the Partnership has filed or furnished with the SEC
all forms, registration statements, reports, schedules and statements
required to be filed or furnished under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act. At the time filed (or, in the case of

 



32  registration statements, solely on the dates of effectiveness) (except to
the extent amended by a subsequently filed Partnership SEC Document prior to
the date of this Agreement, in which case as of the date of such amendment),
each Partnership SEC Document complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be and, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) Any consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents (the " _Partnership Financial Statements_ ") as of
their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment)
(A) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (B) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a

regulations), and (C) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated

5.8 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Partnership has established and
maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls
and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Partnership, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the Partnerships principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Partnerships
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Partnerships
auditors and the audit committee of the Partnership Board (x) all significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect the Partnerships ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Partnerships auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Partnerships internal controls. The principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of the Partnership have made
all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and
any related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Partnership SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete and correct as of the dates they were made.

33 _ _ the Partnerships Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 2014 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ "), and in the financial
statements (or notes thereto) included in subsequent Partnership SEC Documents
filed by the Partnership prior to the date of this Agreement, neither the
Partnership nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had at the Balance Sheet
Date or has incurred since that date, any liabilities or obligations (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of any nature, except (i)
liabilities, obligations or contingencies that (A) are accrued or reserved
against in the financial statements of the Partnership included in the
Partnership SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, or
reflected in the notes thereto, (B) were incurred since the Balance Sheet Date
and prior to the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practices, or (C) were incurred in accordance with
this Agreement or (ii) liabilities, obligations or contingencies that (A)

5.18_) and environmental matters (which are provided for in _Section 5.13_),
the Partnership is in compliance with all, and is not in default under or in
violation of any, applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default or
violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership has
not received any written communication since the Balance Sheet Date and prior
to the date of this Agreement from a Governmental Authority that alleges that
the Partnership is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of
any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Partnership is in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exemptions,

default, other events, notices or modifications as to which requisite waivers
or consents have been obtained or which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse

prepared by Netherland, Sewall and Associates, Inc. referred to in
the Partnerships Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and
procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the

Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate, be

the Parent Intellectual Property by Parent and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of Parents business as presently conducted does not infringe upon
or misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for
such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. __

ARTICLE VII

 

COVENANTS

The Partnership Entities hereby covenant to and agree with the Parent
Entities, and the Parent Entities and Merger Sub hereby covenant to and agree
with the Partnership Entities, that:

 

7.1 _Consummation of the Merger_.

 

 __(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including
_Section 7.1(d)_), each of the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the
Partnership Entities, on the other hand, will cooperate with the other and use
(and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents (including any required or
recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain promptly
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals, consents,
clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations,
permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental
Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger and (iv) obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from
third parties. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws issued by a
Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition. __

 



57 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within 15 Business Days after the
date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by
their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this
_Section 7.1_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date). Parent will pay any HSR Act filing
fee.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Merger, including any
proceeding initiated by a private Person, (ii) promptly inform the Other
Parties of (and supply to the Other Parties) any communication received by
such Party from, or given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority and any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding the Merger, (iii)
permit the Other Parties to review in advance and incorporate the Other
Parties reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it to any
Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining any clearances required
under any Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (iv) consult with the Other Parties in advance of any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not
prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Other
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and teleconferences. Subject to _Section 7.4(b)_, the Parties will take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 7.1_ in a manner so as to
preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its
Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including
by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger, in each
case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in
any event no later than the Outside Date, including, without limitation, (x)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent
(or any of its Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Entity or any equity interest in
any joint venture held by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or the
Surviving Entity, (y) creating, terminating or divesting relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent (or any of its
Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Entity and (z) otherwise taking or committing
to take any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect

 



58 _ _ to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent
(including any of its Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Entity or any equity
interest in any joint venture held by Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or
the Surviving Entity, in each case as may be required in order to obtain all
approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the
commencement of any action to prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby
under any Antitrust Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order in any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Merger or
delay the Closing beyond the Outside Date. To assist Parent in complying with
its obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_, the Partnership will enter
into one or more agreements requested by Parent to be entered into prior to
the Closing with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or
otherwise take any action that limits the Surviving Entitys freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets,
equity interests, product lines or properties of the Surviving Entity or any
equity interest in any joint venture held by the Surviving Entity (each, a "
_Divestiture Action_ "); ___provided, however_ __, that the consummation of
the transactions provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action
will be conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction of all of the conditions
to the Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately following
such Divestiture Action (and where Parent has irrevocably committed to effect
the Closing immediately following such Divestiture Action). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.1_ or
elsewhere shall require, or be deemed to require, any Parent Entity or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any Divestiture Action
if doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Partnership and Parent, taken together. __

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
Parties contained in this _Section 7.1_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger as
violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Partnership will use
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger.

7.2 _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but no later
than 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement unless otherwise
mutually agreed by the Parties), the Partnership will prepare and file with
the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent will prepare and Parent will file with
the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Each of the Partnership and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and
keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent also agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary state securities law
or "Blue Sky"

 



59  permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Partnership will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Partnership Unitholders as promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under
the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Registration Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Partnership without
providing the Other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Partnership or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Partnership or Parent that should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such
information will promptly notify the Other Parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information will be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the
Partnership Unitholders. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional
information and will supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the
staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all
orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement.

 

(b) The Partnership will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective by
the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Partnership Meeting.
The Partnership Meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable, and,
if reasonably practicable, shall be held within 45 days after the mailing of
the Proxy Statement. Subject to _Section 7.3_, the Partnership will, through
the Partnership Board, (i) determine that the Merger is in the best interests
of the Partnership and the Partnership Unitholders and (ii) recommend that
the Partnership Unitholders approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the " _Partnership
Board Recommendation_ "). The Proxy Statement shall (subject to _Section
7.3)_ include the Partnership Board Recommendation. The Partnerships
obligations to call, give notice of and hold the Partnership Meeting in
accordance with _Section 7.2(a)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected
by the making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any
Superior Proposal or Alternative Proposal, or by any Partnership Change in
Recommendation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Partnership agrees that: (i) unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_ (including, if applicable, upon payment of the
Termination Fee and Parent Expenses), the Partnership shall not submit any
Superior Proposal to a vote of the Partnership Unitholders; and (ii) the
Partnership shall not (without Parents prior written consent) adjourn,
postpone or cancel (or propose, publicly or otherwise, or resolve to, to
adjourn, postpone or cancel) the Partnership Meeting. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Partnership may postpone or adjourn the
Partnership Meeting (i) in the absence of proxies sufficient to obtain the
Partnership Unitholder Approval, to solicit

 



60  additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining Partnership Unitholder
Approval, (ii) in the absence of a quorum, and (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that the Partnership has determined after consultation with outside
legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Partnership
Unitholders prior to Partnership Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if there occurs a Partnership Change in
Recommendation, the Partnership shall remain required to call, hold and
convene the Partnership Meeting unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

7.3 _Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation_.

(a) The Partnership will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers, and employees, and will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective other Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to an Alternative Proposal, and
request the return or destruction of all confidential information previously
provided to such Persons by or on behalf of the Partnership or its
Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this _Section 7.3_, the Partnership
will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers and employees not to, and will use reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective other Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Alternative Proposal, or (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-
public information with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this  _Section 7.3_, if at any time following the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (i) the
Partnership has received a written Alternative Proposal which was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement and that the Partnership Board
believes is _bona fide_ , and that did not result from a breach of this
_Section 7.3_ and (ii) the Partnership Board, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that
such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to or result in a Superior Proposal, then the Partnership may, subject to
_clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below, (A) furnish information, including
confidential information, with respect to the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative Proposal; provided
that (x) (I) at least 24 hours prior to furnishing any such non-public
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Partnership gives Parent written notice of the identity of
such Person and the Partnerships intention to furnish non-public information
to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person and (II) the
Partnership receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of, an
executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions, including
limitations on the use and disclosure of non-public written and oral
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Partnership, not
materially less favorable to the Partnership than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement, and (y) the Partnership will provide to Parent any non-public
information about the Partnership and its Subsidiaries that was not previously
provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently
with providing or making available such non-public information to such other
Person.

 



61 (b) In addition to the obligations of the Partnership set forth in this
_Section 7.3_, the Partnership will promptly (and in no event later than 24
hours after receipt) (i) advise Parent in writing of any Alternative Proposal
(and any changes thereto) and the material terms and conditions of any such
Alternative Proposal, including the identity of such Person making such
Alternative Proposal, and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written
proposals or draft agreements received by the Partnership or any
Representative of the Partnership setting forth the terms and conditions of,
or otherwise relating to, such Alternative Proposal. The Partnership will keep
Parent reasonably informed of all material developments with respect to the
status and terms of any such Alternative Proposal, offers, inquiries or
requests (and the Partnership shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any
additional written proposals received by the Partnership or that the
Partnership has delivered to any third party making an Alternative Proposal
relating to such Alternative Proposal) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. The Partnership Parties agree that neither
Partnership Party nor any of the Subsidiaries of the Partnership will enter
into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
which prohibits the Partnership from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 7.3_.

 

 __(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, the Partnership
Board shall not: (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Parent the Partnership Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the
Partnership Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) publicly
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Alternative Proposal (any action described in this _Section 7.3(c)(i)_ being
referred to as a " _Partnership Change in Recommendation_ "); (ii) approve,
adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, or
allow the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement, or other similar contract or any tender or exchange
offer providing for, with respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative
Proposal; (iii) fail to announce publicly within 10 Business Days after
a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the Partnership Units shall have
been commenced that the Partnership Board recommends rejection of such tender
offer or exchange offer and reaffirming the Partnership Board Recommendation;
or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to, or permit the Partnership or
any Representative of the Partnership to agree or publicly propose to take any
of the actions referred to in this _Section 7.3(c)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, a public statement that describes the Partnerships receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed a Partnership Change in Recommendation. __

 

 __(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Partnership receives a
written Alternative Proposal (and such proposal is not withdrawn) that the
Partnership Board believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did
not result from a breach of this _Section 7.3_ and (iii) the Partnership
Board determines, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
then the Partnership Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, terminate this _ _

 



62  Agreement and pay Parent a Termination Fee and/or effect a Partnership
Change in Recommendation; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership Board may
not take such action pursuant to the foregoing unless:

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of
the proposed definitive agreement providing for the Alternative Proposal for
such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other relevant
proposed transaction agreements, at least three Business Days in advance of
its intention to take such action with respect to a Partnership Change in
Recommendation, unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be
given there are less than three Business Days prior to the Partnership
Meeting, in which case the Partnership will provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the "
_Notice Period_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any material
amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new notice
pursuant to this _Section 7.3(d)(i)_ and a new Notice Period, except that
such new Notice Period in connection with any amendment shall be for two
Business Days from the time Parent receives such notice (as opposed to three
Business Days)); and

 

(ii) during the Notice Period the Partnership has negotiated with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the determination of the
Partnership Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel) a Superior Proposal.

(e) The Partnership Board is permitted, at any time prior to obtaining the
Partnership Unitholder Approval, other than in connection with an Alternative
Proposal, to make a Partnership Change in Recommendation in response to an
Intervening Event but only if (i) prior to taking any such action, the
Partnership Board determines in good faith, after consultation with and
considering the advice of the Partnerships outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Delaware law, the Existing Partnership Agreement or the Partnership
GP Agreement, (ii) the Partnership has given at least three Business Days
advance written notice to Parent that the Partnership Board intends to take
such action (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for
such action) and (iii) during such period the Partnership has negotiated, and
has used reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so as to permit the Partnership Board (in its judgment, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) not to
make the determination described in  _clause (i)_. If after compliance with
the foregoing _clauses (i)_  (iii) the Partnership Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Partnership Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Delaware law, the
Existing Partnership Agreement or the Partnership GP Agreement, then the
Partnership Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation. An "
_Intervening Event_ " means a material event, circumstance, state of facts,
occurrence,

 



63  development or change that did not exist or was not known to the Partnership
Board on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Partnership Board as of the
date of this Agreement), which event, circumstance, state of facts,
occurrence, development or change, or any material consequences thereof,
becomes known to the Partnership Board prior to the receipt of
the Partnership Unitholder Approval; _provided, however_ , that (A) in no
event shall the receipt, existence, potential for or terms of an Alternative
Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an
Intervening Event and (B) if the Intervening Event relates to a change,
event, development, circumstance, condition, occurrence or effect involving
the Partnership, then none of the following changes, events, developments,
circumstances, conditions, occurrences or effects shall constitute an
Intervening Event: (1) changes in the general economic, financial, credit or
securities markets, including prevailing interest rates or currency rates, or
regulatory or political conditions and changes in oil, natural gas,
condensate or natural gas liquids prices or prices of other commodities,
including changes in price differentials; (2) changes in general economic
conditions in the (v) oil and gas exploration and production industry, (w)
natural gas gathering, compressing, treating, processing and transportation
industry generally, (x) the natural gas liquids fractionating and
transportation industry generally, (y) the crude oil and condensate logistics
and marketing industry generally, and (z) the natural gas marketing and
trading industry generally (including in each case changes in law affecting
such industries); (3) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, performance of obligations under this
Agreement); and (4) changes in any Laws or regulations applicable to the
Partnership or applicable accounting regulations or the interpretations
thereof.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
Partnership Board from taking and disclosing to the Partnership Unitholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership Unitholders)
or from making any legally required disclosure to Partnership Unitholders.
Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the Partnership or the Partnership
Board to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Partnership
Unitholders) will not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal,
modification or change in any manner adverse to Parent of, all or a portion
of the Partnership Board Recommendation.

(g) The Partnership agrees that it will not release or permit the release of
any Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any
provision of, any "standstill" or similar agreement or provision to which the
Partnership is or becomes a party or under which the Partnership has
any rights, and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce each such
agreement or provision at the request of Parent.

(h) The Partnership acknowledges and agrees that any action inconsistent with
any provision set forth in this _Section 7.3_ that is taken by a
Representative of the Partnership that, if taken by the Partnership would have
been a breach of this  _Section 7.3_, shall be deemed to constitute a breach
of such provision by the Partnership.

(i) Promptly, but in any event no later than 24 hours after the date of this
Agreement, the Partnership shall request each Person that has executed a
confidentiality or

 



64  similar agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of a
possible Alternative Proposal to return or destroy all confidential
information previously furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Partnership.

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer, which was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement, from any Person or "group" (as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions), of assets of the
Partnership equal to 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Partnership
or to which 20% or more of the Partnerships revenues or earnings are
attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions) of beneficial ownership
(within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of
any class of the Partnerships equity securities, (C) tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "group"
(as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 20% or
more of any class of the Partnerships equity securities, or (D)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Partnership which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire
beneficial ownership of at least 20% of the Partnerships consolidated assets
or equity interests; in each case, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written offer, which was not solicited
after the date of this Agreement and which was obtained after the date of
this Agreement, to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 75% of the
outstanding equity securities of the Partnership or more than 75% of the
assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiary, made by a third party, which
did not result from a breach of _Section 7.3_, is on terms and conditions
which the Partnership Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to be more favorable from
a financial point of view to the Partnership Unitholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account at the time
of determination (a) relevant financial considerations, (b) the identity of
the person making such offer, (c) the anticipated timing, conditions and
prospects for completion of the transactions contemplated by such offer, (d)
the other terms and conditions of such offer and the implications thereof on
the Partnership, including relevant legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such offer and (e) any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that
time had been committed to by Parent in writing.

 

7.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the Other Parties and their
respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
(and, with respect to books and records, the right to copy) to all of its and
its Subsidiaries properties, commitments, books, contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives. Each Party shall furnish promptly to the Other

 



65  Parties (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
Laws and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters") received
by such Party from the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii)
all other information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as the Other Parties may reasonably request,
including information necessary to prepare the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Partnership shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent (1) on a monthly basis reports
specifying the capital expenditures, operating expenses, production and
completed and in-progress activities of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries,
together with a comparison to the relevant items in the Partnership 2014
Budget, and (2) weekly operating reports, in each case, to the extent as
prepared by the Partnership in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, each Party and its Representatives shall hold
information received from the Other Parties pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ in
confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) This _Section 7.4_ shall not require any Party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such Party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such Partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Partys position in any
pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Other Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_
that, in the case of _clause (i)_, the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to
find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1) would
not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel)) reasonably be expected to result in the violation of any such
contract or Law or reasonably be expected to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-
employee Representatives of the Other Party shall be provided access to such
information; provided, further, that the Party being requested to disclose the
information shall (x) notify the Other Parties that such disclosures would
reasonably be expected to violate its or its Subsidiaries obligations under
any such contract or Law or would reasonably be expected to cause such
privilege to be undermined and (y) communicate to the Other Parties in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the first proviso in this _Section 7.4(b)_) and (z) in the case where
such disclosures would be reasonably expected to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 



66 7.5 _Public Statements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by Parent and the Partnership. Parent and the Partnership will
not, and each of the foregoing will cause its Representatives not to, issue
any public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written
approval of the Parties; _provided, however_ , that a Party or its
Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures
required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys or
its Parent entitys capital stock is traded, provided such Party uses
reasonable best efforts to afford the Other Party an opportunity to first
review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comment
regarding same; _provided, however_ , that this _Section 7.5_ shall not be
deemed to restrict in any manner the Partnerships ability to communicate
with its employees and that the Partnership shall not be required by this
_Section 7.5_ to consult with any Other Party with respect to a public
announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of an Alternative
Proposal and matters related thereto or a Partnership Change in
Recommendation, but nothing in this _Section 7.5_ shall limit the
Partnerships obligations under _Section 7.3_.

 

 __7.6 _Confidentiality_ __. The obligations of Parent and the Partnership
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
all information provided to any Party or its Representatives pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement is deemed to be "Evaluation Material" as
defined under the Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that
nothing in the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the
performance by the Partnership Parties or the Parent Parties of their
respective obligations under this Agreement, and in the case of any conflict
between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement the terms of this Agreement shall control. __

 

7.7 _Takeover Laws_. Neither the Partnership nor Parent will take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each of them will
take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from
the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

7.8 _New Common Units Listed_. Parent will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on the NASDAQ, upon official notice of
issuance, the New Common Units.

 

7.9 _Third-Party Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent and the
Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to prepare all documentation, to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and third parties 

 



67  necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to comply with the terms and conditions of such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations and to cause the Merger to be consummated as expeditiously
as practicable. Each of Parent and the Partnership has the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party
or any Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each
of the Parties agrees to act reasonably and promptly. Each Party agrees that
it will consult with the Other Parties with respect to the obtaining of all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will keep the
Other Parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

(b) Each of Parent and the Partnership agrees, upon request, to furnish the
Other Party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and unitholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such Other Party or any of such Other Partys Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(c) This _Section 7.9_ shall not apply to (i) approval under Antitrust Laws
or (ii) approval of the SEC of the Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement.

7.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment
or indemnification agreement or under the Existing Partnership Agreement, the
Director and Officer Indemnification Agreements, this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Partnerships Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Entity, jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the
Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Partnership GP, the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such
Person, in their capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not
such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Partnership) serving at
the request of or on behalf of the Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of
its Subsidiaries and together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law in connection with any Claim
or Action against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within 15 days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any Indemnification
Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or
otherwise participating

 



68  with respect to any Claim or Action in advance of the final disposition of
such Claim or Action, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the
Indemnified Party of any Indemnification Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security. The indemnification and advancement obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section 7.10(a)_ extend
to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim
or Action relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue
as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and
inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this _Section 7.10_: (x) the term " _Claim_ "
means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action or proceeding,
whether instituted by any Party, any Governmental Authority or any other
person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the
institution of any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism (" _Action_ "), arising out of or
pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a director or officer of the Partnership GP or of any of its
Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any
compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term " _Indemnification
Expenses_ " means documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and expenses and
all other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses and
obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to this _Section 7.10(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party; and (z) the
phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law"
includes, but is not limited to (1) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any provision of the DRULPA and the DLLCA that authorizes or
permits additional indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the
corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement of the DRULPA and
the DLLCA and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
amendments to or replacements of the DRULPA and the DLLCA adopted after the
date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an entity may
indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents,
or fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified
Party serves. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DRULPA or the DLLCA
that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective
only and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim
or Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Entity will settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect
of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an

 



69  unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or
such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Existing
Partnership Agreement (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of the Partnership GP or the Partnerships Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements (including, without limitation, the Director and
Officer Indemnification Agreements) of the Partnership GP, the Partnership or
any of its Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving Entity and Parent in
the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Existing
Partnership Agreement and the organizational documents of the Partnerships
Subsidiaries, including any applicable amendments thereto or restatements
thereof, will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation and limitations on
liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Existing
Partnership Agreement and Director and Officer Indemnification Agreements,
which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required
by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law; _provided,
however_ , that any such modification shall be prospective only and shall not
limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or Action
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to modification; and _provided_ _further_ that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any
Claim made within such period continue until the disposition of such Action
or resolution of such Claim.

(d) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will maintain in
effect the current directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability
insurance policies covering the Indemnified Parties (but may substitute
therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage or
are alleged to have occurred) with respect to matters occurring on or before
the Effective Time, but Parent is not required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") and will purchase the maximum amount
of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in
this _Section 7.10(d)_ would cost in excess of that amount. If Parent elects,
then Parent may, on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy"
with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior
to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by
such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no
event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the Partnership, exceed
six times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall have any further obligations
under this _Section 7.10(d)_.

 



70 (e) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.10_.

 

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.10_.

 

(g) This _Section 7.10_ survives the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal
representatives, and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their
respective successors and assigns.

 

7.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Partnership shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Partnership, to
the extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Partnership or Parent, (ii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries and that relate to the Merger, (iii) the discovery of any
fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VIII_ and (iv)
any material failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which would result in
the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in
_Article VIII_; _provided_ that, in the case of _clauses (iii)_ and _(iv)_ ,
the failure to comply with this _Section 7.11_ shall not result in the
failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article
VIII_, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under _Article
IX_, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and
of itself give rise to such failure or right.

7.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Partnership will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Partnership
Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to Partnership
Common Units) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Partnership, or will become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



71 7.13 [Intentionally Omitted]

 

7.14 _Distributions_. Each of the Partnership and Parent will consult with the
Other Party regarding the declaration and payment of distributions in respect
of Partnership Common Units, Partnership Class B Units, Partnership Class C
Units and the Parent Common Units and the record and payment dates relating
thereto, so that no Partnership Unitholder receives two distributions, or
fails to receive one distribution, for any single calendar month with respect
to its applicable Partnership Common Units, Partnership Class B Units,
Partnership Class C Units or any Parent Common Units any such Partnership
Unitholder receives in exchange therefor pursuant to the Merger.

7.15 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) At least five business days prior to the Closing, Parent or an Affiliate
of Parent shall extend offers of employment, which offers shall be effective
as of the Closing, to (i) each Employee that is a field-level Employee and
(ii) each Employee employed in the positions to be offered on Schedule 7.15(a)
(collectively, the " _Business Employees_ "). The Partnership shall cooperate
with Parent to make the Business Employees reasonably accessible to the Parent
and to assist Parent in its efforts to secure satisfactory employment
arrangements with any Business Employees. The Partnership shall, or shall use
reasonable efforts to cause QRM to, terminate for all purposes (including
under all Partnership Employee Benefit Plan) the employment of each Business
Employee. Each Business Employee who commences employment with Parent or an
Affiliate thereof, effective as of the Closing, shall hereinafter be referred
to as a " _Continuing Employee_ " as of the Closing.

(b) For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each of the Continuing Employees
with (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable
than such Continuing Employees base salary or wage rate as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) a target annual cash bonus opportunity that
is no less favorable than the target annual cash bonus opportunity provided to
such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(iii) other health and welfare employee benefits (but, for clarity, excluding
equity-based compensation and retiree welfare and defined benefit plans) that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefits
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(c) Without limiting _Section 7.15(b)_, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to , provide to the Business Employees whose employment is
terminated at or following the Effective Time with the severance payments and
benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions mutually agreed to
between Parent and the Partnership prior to Closing.

 

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, cause each compensation or employee benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Affiliates and in which any Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in, to treat the prior service of such Continuing
Employee with any of Partnership, QRM and their respective Affiliates as
service rendered to Parent or its Affiliates, as the case may be, for all
purposes

 



72  (including vesting, eligibility, level of benefit and benefit accrual
purposes, but other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan or retiree welfare plan or vesting under any equity compensation
plan) to the extent that such service crediting does not violate any
applicable Law or result in duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

 

(e) Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of any
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents due to pre-existing
conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment requirements, and
requirements to show evidence of good health under the applicable health and
welfare plan of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent to the extent such
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents are covered under a
health and welfare benefit plan of the Partnership, QRM or any of their
respective Affiliates (as the case may be), and such conditions, periods or
requirements are satisfied or waived under such plan, immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) credit each Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents with all deductible payments, co-payments and co-insurance
paid by such employee and covered dependents under the medical employee
benefit plan of the Partnership, QRM or any of their respective
Affiliates (as the case may be) prior to the Effective Time during the year
in which the Effective Time occurs for the purpose of determining the extent
to which any such employee and his or her dependents have satisfied their
deductible and whether they have reached the out-of-pocket maximum under the
applicable medical plan of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent for such year.

(f) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Continuing Employee is entitled during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, assume and honor all vacation and other paid time off days
accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Continuing Employee as of the
Effective Time.

(g) Unless otherwise notified by Parent in writing, prior to the Effective
Time, the Partnership shall take or cause to be taken any and all actions
necessary or appropriate, including board approvals, to terminate the
Partnership LTIP effective as of and contingent upon the Closing.

(h) The provisions of this _Section 7.15_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Employee, Business Employee or Continuing Employee or other
current or former employee of the Partnership, QRM or any of their respective
Affiliates), other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including
with respect to the matters provided for in this  _Section 7.15_) under or
by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 7.15_
amends, or will be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or termination
of) any Partnership Employee Benefit Plan or any Parent Employee Benefit
Plan. Parent has no obligation to continue to employ or retain the services of
any Continuing Employee for any period of time following the Effective Time
and, except as specifically provided in this _Section 7.15_, Parent will be
entitled to modify any compensation or benefits provided to, and any other
terms or conditions of employment of, any such employees in its absolute
discretion.

 



73 7.16 _Transaction Litigation_. The Partnership shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any security
holder litigation against the Partnership, the Partnership GP and/or its
respective directors relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Partnership shall
cooperate, shall cause the Partnership Subsidiaries to cooperate, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to cooperate, in the defense against such litigation.

 

7.17 _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership
Entities shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and expense, provide all
cooperation that is reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in connection
with any financing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger as may be reasonably requested by Parent or its Representatives.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Partnership Entities
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to
(i) furnish, as promptly as practicable, the report of the Companys auditor
on the most recently available audited consolidated financial statements of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use of such report in accordance
with normal custom and practice and use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such auditor to provide customary comfort letters (providing "negative
assurance" comfort) and drafts thereof to the underwriters, initial purchasers
or placement agents, as applicable, in connection with such financing by
Parent; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish, as promptly as
practicable, financial statements and other financial data of the Partnership
as would be required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act for a registered public offering to consummate any
offering(s) of securities contemplated by such financing; and (iii) provide
reasonable and customary assistance in the preparation of one or more
confidential information memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda,
private placement memoranda and other marketing and syndication materials
(including the provision of authorization letters and a representation with
respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information)
reasonably requested by Parent, including by making available, at reasonable
times and on reasonable advance notice, employees and advisors of the
Partnership Entities; provided that (x) none of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur
any other liability or obligation in connection with such financing or to take
any action that would be prohibited by any applicable Law or cause a default
of, or breach under, or otherwise violate any Partnership Material Agreement,
in each case except for any payment, incurrence or action that is conditioned
upon, and shall not take effect until, the Effective Time, (y) no obligations
of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, opinion,
contract, indenture or other document or instrument delivered pursuant to this
_Section 7.17_ shall be effective until the Effective Time, and none of the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any
action pursuant to this _Section 7.17_ under any certificate, opinion,
contract, indenture or other document or instrument that is not contingent
upon the Closing or that would be effective

 



74  prior to the Effective Time and (z) none of the Partnership or its senior
officers shall be required to engage in any action that would interfere
unreasonably with the business of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, directors and other Representatives from and
against any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of any financing by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and any information utilized in
connection therewith except (A) with respect to information supplied by the
Partnership, its Subsidiaries and Representatives specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein and/or (B) to the extent such losses and
damages arise from the willful misconduct of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees or Representatives.

7.18 _Parent Distributions._ Subject to the Parent Partnership Agreement and
Delaware law, effective as of the first full calendar month following the
Effective Time, Parent shall increase its monthly distributions to the holders

TERMINATION

9.1  _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to
the Closing as follows:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Partnership and Parent;

(b) by the Partnership or Parent if there is in effect a final nonappealable
order of a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(b)_ is not available to the Partnership, on the one
hand, or Parent, on the other hand, if such order was primarily due to the
failure of the Partnership, on the one hand, or any of Parent or Merger Sub,
on the other hand, to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(c) by Parent if (i) the Partnership has breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of the Partnership becomes
untrue, and, with respect to either _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above, which
breach, failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the Closing
Date would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.3(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to perform or
untruth is incapable of being cured (or become true) or, if capable of being
cured (or become true), is not cured (or become true) by the earlier of (x)
the Outside Date or (y) within 30 days following receipt by the Partnership of
notice of such breach, failure or untruth from Parent;

(d) by the Partnership if (i) Parent has breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of Parent becomes untrue,
and, with respect to either _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above, which breach,
failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the Closing Date

 



78  would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.2(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to perform or
untruth is incapable of being cured (or become true) or, if capable of being
cured (or become true), is not cured (or become true) by the earlier of (x)
the Outside Date or (y) within 30 days following receipt by Parent of notice
of such breach, failure or untruth from the Partnership;

(e) by the Partnership or Parent if the Closing does not occur on or before
March 31, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that such
failure of the Closing to occur is not due to the failure of such Party to
perform and comply in all material respects with the covenants and agreements
to be performed or complied with by such Party prior to the Closing;

(f) by the Partnership or Parent if the Partnership Meeting has concluded and
the Partnership Unitholder Approval has not been obtained;

(g) by Parent, if a Partnership Change in Recommendation has occurred; or

 

(h) by the Partnership, if the Partnership is terminating to enter into a
definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal in accordance with

9.4(c)_.

9.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by Parent or the Partnership, or both, pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
written notice thereof will forthwith be given to the Other Party or Parties,
and this Agreement will terminate without further action by Parent or the
Partnership.

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated as provided in _Section 9.1_, then each of the Parties will be
relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the
date of such termination and such termination will be without liability to
Parent or the Partnership; _provided_ , that the agreements and obligations of
the Parties set forth in _Section 7.6,_ this _Section 9.3_, _Section 9.4_
and _Article X_ hereof will survive any such termination and are enforceable
hereunder; _provided further_ , that nothing in this _Section 9.3_ relieves
any of Parent or the Partnership of any liability for fraud or any Willful
Breach of any covenant or agreement contained herein occurring prior to
termination, or as provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in which case
the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at
law or in equity (including, in the case of the Parent, liability for damages
based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the
holders of Partnership Units). " _Willful Breach_ " means an intentional and
willful material breach, or an intentional and willful material failure to
perform, in each case that is the consequence of an act or omission by a Party
with the knowledge that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or
would be reasonably expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

9.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) an Alternative Proposal is publicly submitted,
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the

transaction. For purposes of this _Section 9.4(a)_, the term "Alternative
Proposal" has the meaning assigned to such term in  _Section 7.3(j)(i)_,
except that the references to "20% or more" are deemed to be references to
"50% or more."

 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)_ or (ii) by the Partnership pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_,
in each of cases _(i)_ and _(ii)_ , the non-terminating party will pay the
terminating party, within two Business Days after the date of termination, the
Expenses.

 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(g)_, then the Partnership will pay to Parent, within two
Business Days after the date of termination, the Termination Fee or (ii) the
Partnership pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_, then the Partnership will
immediately prior to or simultaneously with such termination pay to Parent,
the Termination Fee.

(d) Any payment of the Termination Fee or Expenses (or applicable portion
thereof) will be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated in writing by the recipient of such payment.

(e) The Partnership acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 9.4_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without
these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. The parties
agree that in the event that the Partnership pays the Termination Fee to
Parent, the Partnership has no further liability to Parent of any kind in
respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) As used herein, (i) " _Termination Fee_ " means a cash amount equal to
$64,875,000, and (ii) " _Expenses_ " means the reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket expenses of a party incurred in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the
transactions contemplated hereby up to an aggregate amount equal to
$16,425,000. In no event will the Partnership or the Parent be required to pay
the other Partys Expenses on more than one occasion.

 

(g) In no event shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of the
Termination Fee in connection with this Agreement pursuant to which the
Termination Fee is payable, and if the Termination Fee is payable at such time
as Parent has already received payment or concurrently receives payment from
the Partnership in respect of Parents Expenses, the amount of such
Expenses actually received by Parent shall be deducted from the Termination
Fee.

 



80 (h) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including in this
_Section 9.4_, each party shall pay its own expenses incident to preparing
for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent and the

_Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

to _Section 10.5_, their respective successors and assigns, and no provision
of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the Parties

10.7 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this
Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

10.8 _Jurisdiction_. 

(a) Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, to the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or,
if jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Federal courts of the United
States, the Federal courts of the United States sitting in the State of
Delaware, and any appellate court from any such state or Federal court, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to
any such claim shall be heard and determined in such Delaware court or in such
Federal court, as applicable. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any
such claim is conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

(b) Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter
in any Delaware state or Federal court located in the State of Delaware and
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any
such court.

 



83 (c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any of
its controlled Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind of description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source or any Financing Related Party, in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York or, if such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any state court located in the Borough of Manhattan (and the
Parties hereto agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue
in, such court in connection therewith), and that the provisions _Section
10.9_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim.

 

10.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS
THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED
TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT
OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY
OF THIS  _SECTION 10.9_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF
EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

10.10 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties
and no past, present or future Affiliate, director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent,
attorney or representative of any Party has any liability for any obligations
or liabilities of the Parties or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 10.11_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) any Party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10.11_, and
each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



84 __10.12 _Survival_ __. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
none of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained
in this Agreement will survive the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article
IX_ prior to the Closing; _provided, however_ , that if the Closing occurs,
the agreements of the Parties in _Sections 3.2, 3.3_, _3.4_ , _3.5_ , _7.10_
, _7.15_ , _7.16_ , _7.18_ and _Article X_ will survive the Closing, and if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, the agreements of the
Parties in _Sections 7.6_, _9.2_ , _9.3_ and _9.4_ , and this _Article X_
will survive such termination. The Confidentiality Agreement shall (i)
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii)
terminate as of the Effective Time. __

 

10.13 _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Partnership Entities agree, on behalf of themselves and
each of their former, current or future officers, directors, managers,
employees, members, partners, Partnership Unitholders, agents and other
representatives and controlled Affiliates (the " _Partnership Parties_ ")
that Parents, Parent GPs and Merger Subs financial institutions and their
respective Affiliates (collectively " _Financing Sources_ "), and each of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, agents, representatives and Affiliates, and
each of their successors and assigns (collectively, " _Finance Related
Parties_ ") shall be subject to no liability or claims to the Partnership
Parties in connection with the financing of or in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (a) no amendment or modification
to _Section 10.6(c)_, _Section 10.8(c)_ or this _Section 10.13_ (or
amendment or modification with respect to any related definitions as they
affect the second paragraph of _Section 10.6(c)_, _Section 10.8(c)_ or this
_Section 10.13_) shall be effective without the prior written consent of each
Financing Source (on behalf of themselves and the applicable Financing
Related Parties), (b) no amendment or modification to _Section 9.4_ (or any
amendment or modification with respect to any related definitions as they
affect _Section 9.4_) that would be adverse to the Financing Sources or the
Financing Related Parties shall be effective without the prior written consent
of each Financing Source (on behalf of themselves and the applicable Financing
Related Parties), and (c) each Financing Source and Financing Related Party
shall be an express third party beneficiary of, and shall have the right to
enforce, the second paragraph of _Section 10.6(c)_, _Section 10.8(c)_ or
this _Section 10.13_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that _Section 10.3_
notwithstanding, this _Section 10.13_ shall be interpreted and any action
relating to this provision shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York.
