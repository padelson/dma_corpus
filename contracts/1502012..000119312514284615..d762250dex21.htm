All New Common Units to be issued in the Merger will be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates. Upon the issuance of New Common Units to the holders of Partnership Common Units and Partnership Class B Units in accordance with this
<U>Section&nbsp;3.3</U>, and the compliance by such holders with the requirements of the Parent Agreement, which requirements may be satisfied by each holder of New Common Units by the execution and delivery by such holder of a completed and

consummated pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a contribution of all of the assets of the Partnership to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the cash received in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Units and the assumption of liabilities. To the maximum extent possible, any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units shall be treated as a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures described in Treasury Regulation <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Section&nbsp;1.707-4(d).</FONT> To the extent the any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units exceeds the amount that can be so treated, such excess cash will be treated as proceeds of a disguised sale
transaction described in Section&nbsp;707(a)(2)(B) of the Code (a &#147;<B><I>Disguised Sale</I></B>&#148;). Each holder of Partnership Class&nbsp;C Units will be deemed to have consented for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and to the extent
