ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE PRICE

Section 2.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Interests (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be THREE BILLION FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE MILLION
dollars ($3,475,000,000) (the " _Unadjusted Purchase Price_ "), adjusted
as provided in Section 2.3.

Section 2.2 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

(a) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Shares of each
Company and to the Additional Assets as set forth on Schedule 2.2(a) (each an
" _Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price_ "). The adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under Section 2.3 shall be applied to the Interest Unadjusted
Purchase Price for the Shares of each Company and the Additional Assets based
upon the owner of the specific Mineral Interest, Well or other asset to which
the adjustment relates, if determinable. Any adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under Section 2.3 that are not specific to any Company or
Additional Asset group shall be applied pro rata to the Interest Unadjusted
Purchase Price for the Shares of each Company and the Additional Assets, as
previously adjusted, in proportion to the amount of each. Each Interest
Unadjusted Purchase Price, as so adjusted, shall be referred to herein as the
" _Interest Purchase Price_."

(b) On the Closing Date, DRI shall receive the Purchase Price on behalf of
itself and the other Sellers. Each Seller shall be entitled to the portion of
the Purchase Price equal to the Interest Purchase Price for the various
Interests it is selling. 

(c) Within forty-five (45) days after the Target Closing Date, Sellers shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the best information
available to Sellers, a schedule (the " _Preliminary Section 2.2(c)
Schedule_"), along with reasonably detailed supporting documentation, setting
forth the following items:

(i) the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in Section 2.1
allocated to the DEPI Shares and the Reserve Shares consistently with
Schedule 2.2(a);

(ii) the liabilities of the Companies and the Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries as of
the Closing (as required for the allocations under clause (iii));

(iii) an allocation of the sum of the Unadjusted Purchase Price under clause
(i) and the aggregate amount of such liabilities under clause (ii) that are
part of the aggregate deemed sale price within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation §1.338-4 and the adjusted grossed-up basis within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation §1.338-5 among the classes of assets of the Companies and
any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary as of the Closing, which allocations shall be made
in accordance with Section 338(b)(5) and (h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and shall be consistent with the Allocated Values
pursuant to Section 3.4;

(iv) the portion of the Unadjusted Purchase Price as set forth in Section 2.1
allocated to the Additional Assets consistently with Schedule 2.2(a);



 

16 _Execution Version_



 

(v) the liabilities associated with the Additional Assets as of the Closing
(as required for the allocations under clause (vi)); and

(vi) an allocation of the sum of the Unadjusted Purchase Price under clause
(iv) and the aggregate amount of such liabilities under clause (v) that are
includable in DTIs amount realized and the Purchasers tax basis in the
Additional Assets among the classes of the Additional Assets as of the
Closing, which allocations shall be made in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and shall be consistent with
the Allocated Values pursuant to Section 3.4. 

Sellers shall at Purchasers request make reasonable documentation available
to support the proposed allocation. As soon as reasonably practicable, but
not later than forty-five (45) days following receipt of Sellers proposed
allocation schedule, Purchaser shall deliver to DRI a written report
containing any changes that Purchaser proposes to be made in such
schedule (and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail). The
Parties shall undertake to agree on a final schedule no later than fifteen
(15) Business Days subsequent to the receipt by Sellers of Purchasers
proposed changes.

 

Within thirty (30) days after the later of the determination of the Purchase
Price under Section 8.4(b) and the agreement on the schedule described above
in this Section 2.2(c), such schedule shall be amended by Sellers and
delivered to Purchaser to reflect the Purchase Price following final
adjustments. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers in the preparation of the
amended schedule in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 9.4.
If Sellers amendments to the schedule to reflect the Purchase Price following
the final adjustments are not objected to by Purchaser (by written notice to
DRI specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail) within thirty (30)
days after delivery of Sellers adjustments to the schedule, it shall be
deemed agreed upon by the Parties and shall constitute the " _Final Section
2.2(c) Schedule_." In the event that the Parties cannot reach an agreement
within twenty (20) days after DRI receives notice of any objection by
Purchaser, then, any Party may refer the matters in dispute to KPMG LLP ("
_KPMG_ ") or another mutually acceptable independent appraiser (the "
_Independent Appraiser_ ") to assist in determining the matters in dispute
with respect to the allocation of the Purchase Price as finally adjusted among
the separate classes of Company Assets or Additional Assets, as the case may
be, solely for the purposes of the allocation described in this Section
2.2(c). Should KPMG fail or refuse to agree to serve as Independent Appraiser
within twenty (20) days after written request from any Party to serve, and
the Parties fail to agree in writing on a replacement Independent Appraiser
within ten (10) days after the end of that twenty (20) day period, or should
no replacement Independent Appraiser agree to serve within forty-five (45)
days after the original written request pursuant to this sentence, the
Independent Appraiser shall be appointed by the New York, New York office of
the American Arbitration Association. The Independent Appraiser shall be
instructed to deliver to Purchaser and Sellers a written determination of the
valuation and any revisions to the Preliminary Section 2.2(c) Schedule within
thirty (30) days after the date of referral thereof to the Independent
Appraiser. Purchaser and Sellers agree to accept the Independent Appraisers
determinations as to the matters in dispute and the appropriate adjustments to
the schedule to reflect those determinations, which as so adjusted
shall constitute the Final Section 2.2(c) Schedule. The Independent Appraiser
may determine the issues in dispute following such procedures, consistent with
Schedule 2.2(a), the provisions of this Agreement and the Allocated Values, as
it reasonably deems appropriate in the



 

17 _Execution Version_



 

circumstances and with reference to the amounts in issue. The Parties do not
intend to impose any particular procedures upon the Independent Appraiser, it
being the desire and direction of the Parties that any such disagreement shall
be resolved as expeditiously and inexpensively as reasonably practicable. The
Independent Appraiser shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed aspects of the allocation schedule submitted
by any Party and may not award damages, interest, or penalties to any Party
with respect to any matter. Each Seller and Purchaser shall bear its own
legal fees and costs of presenting its case. DRI shall bear one half and
Purchaser shall bear one half of the costs and expenses of the Independent
Appraiser.

The allocations set forth in the Final Section 2.2(c) Schedule shall be used
by Sellers, Purchaser and the Companies and Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries as the
basis for reporting asset values and other items, including the determination
of the aggregate deemed sale price and the adjusted grossed-up basis of the
assets of the applicable Companies and Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries in accordance
with Treasury Regulation §1.338-4 and §1.338-5 or similar applicable law, for
purposes of all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8883,
Asset Allocation Statement Under Section 338). The allocations set forth in
the Final Section 2.2(c) Schedule shall also be used by Sellers and Purchaser
in preparing Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement.
Such Forms 8594 and 8883 shall be completed, executed and delivered by such
parties as soon as practicable after the Closing but in no event later than
fifteen (15) days prior to the date such form is required to be filed. Sellers
and Purchaser agree not to assert, and will cause their Affiliates not to
assert, in connection with any audit or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes, any asset values or other items inconsistent with the amounts set
forth in the Final Section 2.2(c) Schedule unless otherwise required by a
determination under Section 1313(a) of the Code.

Section 2.3 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. The Interest Unadjusted Purchase
Price shall be adjusted with respect to the Shares of each Company and the
Additional Assets as follows, but only with respect to matters (i) in the case
of Section 2.3(a), for which notice is given on or before the Title Claim Date
and (ii) in the case of Section 2.3(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h)
identified on or before the one hundred eightieth (180th) day following
Closing (the " _Cut-Off Date_ "):

(a) increased or decreased, as appropriate, in accordance with Section 3.5;

(b) decreased as a consequence of Assets excluded from this transaction as a
consequence of the exercise of preferential rights to purchase, as described
in Section 3.7;

(c) decreased by the amount of royalty, overriding royalty and other burdens
payable out of production of Hydrocarbons from the Mineral Interests or the
proceeds thereof to third Persons but held in suspense by any Seller or
Company at the Closing, and any interest accrued in escrow accounts for such
suspended funds, to the extent such funds are not transferred to
Purchasers control at the Closing;

(d) increased by the amount of the Leased Assets Buy-Out Costs in accordance
with Section 6.12 incurred by DRI or its Affiliates;



 

18 _Execution Version_



 

(e) increased by the amount of cash and cash equivalents, if any, in lock
boxes or otherwise in the possession of any Company or Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary at the end of the Closing Date;

(f) increased by the aggregate amount of oil inventories from the Properties
in stock tanks at the end of the Closing Date and produced for the account of
DTI, the Companies and any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing
Date, in barrels, multiplied by (A) with respect to Properties located in the
State of West Virginia, the posted price (less applicable location deduction)
of Appalachian Oil Purchasers Inc. on the Closing Date, or (B) with respect to
Properties located in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the posted price
(less applicable location deduction) of Ergon, Inc. on the Closing Date;

(g) increased by the net amount of (i) all prepaid expenses (including
prepaid Taxes, bonuses, rentals and cash calls to third-party operators) to
the extent applying to the ownership and operation of the Assets or applying
to the Companies or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary after the Closing Date _less_
(ii) all third-party cash call payments received by DTI, the Companies or any
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary as operators to the extent applying to the operation
of the Assets after the Closing Date; and

(h) adjusted (increased or decreased, as applicable) for proceeds and other
income attributable to the Assets, and Property Costs and certain other costs
attributable to the Assets, in accordance with Section 2.4(b) and Section
2.4(c).

The amount of each adjustment to the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price
described in Section 2.3(g) and Section 2.3(h) shall be determined in
accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles
(the " _Accounting Principles_ ").

Section 2.4 _Ordinary Course Pre-Closing Date Costs Paid and Revenues
Received Post-Closing_.

(a) With respect to any revenues earned or Property Costs incurred
with respect to the Assets on or prior to the Closing Date but received or
paid after the Closing Date:

(i) Sellers shall be entitled to all amounts earned from the sale, during the
period up to and including the end of the Closing Date, of Hydrocarbons
produced from or attributable to the Properties, which amounts are received on
or before the Cut-Off Date (reduced by any (A) royalties, overriding
royalties and other burdens payable out of production of Hydrocarbons or the
proceeds thereof that are not included in Property Costs under Section
2.4(a)(ii), (B) gathering, processing and transportation costs paid in
connection with sales of Hydrocarbons that are not included as Property Costs
under Section 2.4(a)(ii) and (C) production Taxes, other Taxes measured by
units of production, severance Taxes, and other Property Costs that in any
such case are deducted by the purchaser of production), and to all other
income earned with respect to the Assets through and including the Closing
Date and received after the Closing Date but on or before the Cut-Off Date;
and 



 

19 _Execution Version_



 

(ii) Sellers shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds
and indemnities with respect to) all Property Costs incurred through and
including the end of the Closing Date that are paid after the Closing Date but
on or before the Cut-Off Date.

"Earned" and "incurred," as used in this Section 2.4, shall be interpreted in
accordance with accounting recognition guidance under the Accounting
Principles and shall be consistent with Sellers current accounting
recognition practices.

(b) Should Purchaser, the Companies or their Affiliates receive after Closing
any proceeds or other income to which Sellers are entitled under Section
2.4(a), Purchaser (on behalf of the Companies or their Affiliates, as
applicable) shall fully disclose, account for and promptly remit the same to
DRI on behalf of Sellers. If, after Closing, Sellers or their Affiliates
(other than a Company or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) receive any proceeds or
other income with respect to the Assets to which such party is not entitled
under Section 2.4(a), DRI shall fully disclose, account for and promptly
remit same to Purchaser.

(c) Should Purchaser, the Companies or their Affiliates pay after Closing any
Property Costs for which Sellers are responsible under Section 2.4(a), DRI
shall reimburse Purchaser (on behalf of the Companies or their Affiliates, as
applicable) promptly after receipt of such Persons invoice, accompanied by
copies of the relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of payment. Should
Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than a Company or any Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary) pay after Closing any Property Costs for which Sellers are not
responsible under Section 2.4(a), Purchaser shall reimburse DRI (on behalf of
Sellers) promptly after receipt of such Persons invoices, accompanied by
copies of the relevant vendor or other invoice and proof of payment.

(d) Sellers shall have no further entitlement to amounts earned from the sale
of Hydrocarbons produced from or attributable to the Properties and other
income earned with respect to the Assets (except any applicable Excluded
Assets) through the end of the Closing Date, and no further responsibility for
Property Costs incurred with respect to the Assets through the end of the
Closing Date, to the extent such amounts have not been received or paid,
respectively, on or before the Cut-Off Date.

Section 2.5 _Procedures_.

(a) For purposes of allocating production (and accounts receivable with
respect thereto), under Section 2.3 and Section 2.4, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons
shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass
through the pipeline flange connecting into the storage facilities located on
the lands subject to the applicable Mineral Interest or, if there are no such
storage facilities, when they pass through the Lease Automatic Custody
Transfer (LACT) meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the
pipelines through which they are transported from those lands, and (ii)
gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Properties when they pass through the Custody Transfer Meters or similar
meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are
transported from the lands subject to the applicable Mineral Interest. Sellers
shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures in accordance with past
practice to arrive at an allocation of production when exact meter readings
are not available. Surface use fees, insurance premiums and other Property
Costs 



 

20 _Execution Version_



 

 that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in
the applicable period falling on or before, or after the Closing Date.
Production Taxes and similar Taxes measured by units of production, and
severance Taxes, shall be prorated based on the amount of Hydrocarbons
actually produced, purchased or sold, as applicable, on or before, and after
the Closing Date. Sellers shall measure the physical inventory of the
oil volume in each stock tank (beginning with the Wells that have
historically produced the greatest volume of oil) commencing on or immediately
prior to the Closing Date to determine the oil inventory as near as possible
to the Closing Date for purposes of the adjustment in Section 2.3(f);
_provided_ that Seller shall provide Purchaser with at least forty-eight (48)
hours written notice on a district basis before measurements in each district
are taken, and Purchaser shall be entitled to designate a representative to
observe the taking of such measurements. The Parties agree that,
notwithstanding the fact each stock tank has not been subject to a physical
inventory as of the end of the Closing Date, the physical inventory taken by
Sellers under this Section 2.5(a) shall constitute the Closing Date oil
inventory subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.3(f).

(b) Notwithstanding Section 2.4(d), Sellers shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, the Companies, the Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries, and their respective Affiliates from and against (together with
all reasonable fees, expenses and costs relating thereto) any production Taxes
and similar Taxes measured by units of production and severance Taxes for
which Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 2.4 and any other
production Taxes and similar Taxes measured by units of production and
severance Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing Period (except for such Taxes
relating to revenues received after the Cut-Off Date to which Sellers are not
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(d)). After Closing, Purchaser shall handle
all joint interest audits and other audits of Property Costs covering periods
for which Sellers are in whole or in part responsible under Section 2.4 (and,
in the case of a Tax Audit related to production Taxes or similar Taxes
measured by units of production or severance Taxes, such reasonable fees,
expenses and costs relating thereto shall be borne by Purchaser and Sellers,
respectively, in the same proportion as such Taxes are or would be borne
economically by Purchaser and Sellers), _provided_ that Purchaser shall not
agree to any adjustments to previously assessed costs for which Sellers are
liable, or any compromise of any audit claims to which Sellers would be
entitled, without the prior written consent of DRI, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided further however_ that
Tax Audits (other than those with respect to production Taxes and similar
Taxes measured by units of production, and severance Taxes) shall be handled
as set forth in Article 9\. Purchaser shall provide DRI with a copy of all
applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by Purchaser,
any Company or any of their Affiliates and relating to periods for which
Sellers are partially responsible.

ARTICLE 3

TITLE MATTERS

Section 3.1 _Title_. For the sole purpose of determining Title Defects, and
subject to the special warranty of title provided by DTI in the Conveyances,
DRI warrants to Purchaser that DTI and each Company (including for
all purposes of this Article 3, any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary owned by such
Company) (as applicable) owns Defensible Title to the Marcellus Leases and the
Wells as of the Closing Date. This warranty and, to the extent 



 

21 _Execution Version_



 

 applicable, the special warranty of title in the Conveyances provide
Purchasers exclusive remedy with respect to any Title Defects.

Section 3.2 _Definition of Defensible Title_.

(a) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " means that
title of DTI or the Companies with respect to the Marcellus Leases and the
Wells, as applicable, that:

(i) entitles DTI or such Company to receive ownership and control of the
Marcellus Leases, the Wells and the Hydrocarbons within, produced, saved and
marketed from the Marcellus Leases and the Wells throughout the duration of
the productive life of such leases and wells (after satisfaction of all
royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests or other
similar burdens paid to third Persons on or measured by production of
Hydrocarbons, hereinafter " _Net Revenue Interest_ "), of not less than the
Net Revenue Interest shown in Schedule 3.4 for such leases and wells,
except (A) decreases in connection with those operations in which DTI or such
Company may elect after the Execution Date (to the extent such election is
permissible under this Agreement) to be a nonconsenting co-owner, (B)
decreases resulting from reversion of interest to co-owners with respect to
operations in which such co-owners elect, after the Execution Date, not to
consent, (C) decreases resulting from the establishment or amendment, after
the Execution Date, of involuntary pools or units, (D) decreases required to
allow other working interest owners to make up past underproduction or
pipelines to make up past under deliveries, and (E) as otherwise expressly
stated in Exhibit A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2 or Schedule 3.4;

(ii) obligates DTI or such Company to bear a percentage of the costs and
expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating to,
any of the Marcellus Leases and the Wells shown in Schedule 3.4 not greater
than the working interest shown in Schedule 3.4, without increase throughout
the productive life of such leases and wells except (A) as otherwise stated
in Exhibit A-1, A-2, B-1, B-2 or Schedule 3.4 and (B) increases that are
accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in DTIs or such Companys
Net Revenue Interest; 

(iii) with respect to the Marcellus Leases, entitles DTI or such Company to
the Net Mineral Acres for such Marcellus Lease set forth on Schedule 3.4; and

(iv) is free and clear of liens, encumbrances, obligations, or defects,
except for and subject to Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Defect_ " means any lien,
charge, encumbrance, obligation (including contract obligation), defect, or
other similar matter (including a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest or
working interest) that, if not cured, causes DTI or the Companies not to have
Defensible Title in and to the Marcellus Leases and the Wells as of the
Closing Date. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " means
any right, circumstance or condition that operates to (i) increase the Net
Revenue Interest of DTI or the Companies as of the Closing Date in any of the
Marcellus Leases and the Wells above that 



 

22 _Execution Version_



 

 shown on Schedule 3.4 without causing a greater than proportionate increase
in DTIs or the Companies working interest, as applicable, above that shown
in Schedule 3.4, or (ii), in the case of the Marcellus Leases, increase the
Net Mineral Acres for such lease above that shown on Schedule 3.4.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be considered Title
Defects:

(i) defects based solely on: (A) lack of information in DTIs or the
Companies files; (B) references to an unrecorded document(s) to which neither
DTI nor any of the Companies or Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries is a party if such
document(s) is dated earlier than January 1, 1970 and not in DTIs or the
Companies files; or (C) Tax assessment, Tax payment or similar records (or
the absence of such activities or records);

(ii) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization,
unless such lack of authorization results in a third Persons actual and

affirmatively shown to exist such that it would give rise to a right to
terminate the lease, which documents shall be included in a Title Defect
Notice; and

(v) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitations or
prescription.

Encumbrances_ " means any or all of the following:

(a) royalties and any overriding royalties, net profits interests, free gas

Section 3.4 _Allocated Values_. Schedule 3.4 sets forth the agreed allocation
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price among the Marcellus Leases and Wells for
purposes of DRI title representation in this Article 3, consistent with the
allocations among the DEPI Shares, Reserve Shares and Additional Assets under
Section 2.2(a). The " _Allocated Value_ " for any Marcellus Lease or Well
equals the portion of the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such
Marcellus Lease or Well on Schedule 3.4, increased or decreased by a share of
each adjustment to the Interest Unadjusted Purchase Price under Section
2.3(c), Section 2.3(d), Section 2.3(e), Section 2.3(e), Section 2.3(f) and
Section 2.3(g). Sellers have accepted such Allocated Values for purposes of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but otherwise make
no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such values.

Section 3.5 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_.

(a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver claim notices
to DRI on behalf of each of the Sellers (each a " _Title Defect Notice_ ")
promptly after the discovery thereof, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing (such cut-off date being the " _Title
Claim Date_ "). To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing
and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s) reasonably
sufficient for DRI to 



 

25 _Execution Version_



 

 determine the basis of each alleged Title Defect, (ii) the Marcellus Lease
or Well adversely affected by such Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect
Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv)
all documents upon which Purchaser relies for its assertion of such Title
Defect, including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for
DRI (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by DRI) to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the amount by which
Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and
information upon which Purchasers belief is based, including any analysis by
any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser. Purchaser shall not be
entitled to protection under DTIs special warranty of title set forth in the
Conveyances against any Title Defect for which a Title Defect Notice is
furnished pursuant to this Section 3.5(a) or any Title Defect disclosed in
writing to Sellers by Purchaser prior to the Title Claim Date.

(b) Should Purchaser discover any Title Benefit on or before the Title Claim
Date, Purchaser shall as soon as practicable, but in any case by the Title
Claim Date, deliver a notice to DRI in writing and including (i) a description
of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Marcellus Lease or Well affected, (iii) the
Allocated Value of the lease or well subject to such Title Benefit and (iv)
the amount by which the Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of
each of those leases or wells is increased by such Title Benefit, and the
computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based. DRI
has the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Purchaser a similar
notice on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit
discovered by Sellers. Sellers shall be deemed to have waived all Title
Benefits of which no Party has given notice on or before the Title Claim
Date, except to the extent Purchaser has failed to give a notice which it was
obligated to give under this Section 3.5(b).

(c) DRI shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at DRIs
sole cost, to cure or remove on or before thirty (30) days after the Closing
Date (the " _Cure Period_ ") any Title Defects for which it has received a
Title Defect Notice from Purchaser prior to the Title Claim Date. No reduction
shall be made to the Closing Payment with respect to any Title Defect for
which DRI has provided notice to Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date
that DRI intends to attempt to cure the Title Defect during the Cure Period (a
" _Remedy Notice_ ") or for which DRI disputes the existence thereof (a "
_Disputed Defect_ "). If any Title Defect with respect to which DRI provided
a Remedy Notice to Purchaser is not cured by DRI within the Cure Period, DRI
shall remedy such Title Defect pursuant to this Section 3.5(c) no later than
forty (40) days after the Closing Date (the " _Remedy Deadline_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that any downward adjustments to the Purchase Price
made pursuant to this Section 3.5(c) shall occur at the times set forth in
Section 8.4; and, _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if, prior to the Remedy
Deadline, DRI and Purchaser cannot agree on (i) the proper and adequate cure
for any such Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect Amount, or (iii) whether the
alleged Title Defect constitutes a Title Defect, such dispute(s) shall be
finally and exclusively resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.5(j). DRIs election to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without
prejudice to its rights under Section 3.5(j) and shall not constitute an
admission against interests or a waiver of DRIs right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title Defect. Any
Disputed Defects that have not been cured, waived, or otherwise resolved by
the Parties prior to the Remedy Deadline shall be exclusively and finally
resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.5(j).



 

26 _Execution Version_



 

(d) In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or, subject
to Section 3.5(c), cured prior to the expiration of the Cure Period, DRI
shall, at its sole election, and subject to the Individual Title Threshold and
the Aggregate Title Deductible, elect to (i) make a downward adjustment to the
Purchase Price equal to an amount determined (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ")
pursuant to Section 3.5(h) as being the value of such Title Defect (taking
into consideration the Allocated Value of the Marcellus Lease or Well
adversely affected by such Title Defect, the portion of the lease or well
subject to such Title Defect and the legal effect of such Title Defect on the
lease or well adversely affected thereby) net of any Title Benefit Amount
calculated in accordance with Section 3.5(i); or (ii) retain the entirety of
the lease or well that is adversely affected by such Title Defect, in which
event, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward, by an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and such lease or well
shall no longer be included within the definition of "Assets" for any purpose
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.5(d), no reduction shall be made in the Unadjusted Purchase Price with
respect to any Title Defect for which DRI, at its election, executes and
delivers to Purchaser a written indemnity agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, under which DRI agrees to
fully, unconditionally and irrevocably indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
and its successors and assigns from any and all Damages arising out of or
resulting from such Title Defect.

(e) Upon DRI electing to remedy a Title Defect pursuant to subsections (d)(i)
or (d)(ii) above, the Parties shall complete any further conveyancing or
reconveyancing of a Marcellus Lease or Well as is necessary to effect such
remedy. In the case of any such reconveyancing, Purchaser shall assign the
relevant lease or well to Sellers with a special warranty of title,
subject to any Permitted Encumbrances ( _mutatis mutandis_ ), by, through,
and under Purchaser. Any downward adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be
made pursuant to Section 8.4.

(f) With respect to each Marcellus Lease or Well affected by Title Benefits
reported under Section 3.5(b) (or which Purchaser should have reported under
Section 3.5(b)), the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount
(the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value
for such lease or well caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant
to Section 3.5(i), but in no event will the aggregate upward adjustments to
the Unadjusted Purchase Price as a result of Title Benefits exceed the
aggregate downward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price due to Title
Defects.

(g) This Article 3 and, to the extent applicable, DTIs special warranty of
title in the Conveyances, shall be the exclusive right and remedy of
Purchaser with respect to Title Defects. In this regard and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if a Title Defect under this
Article 3 results from any matter which could also result in the breach of
any representation or warranty of a Seller as set forth in Article 4, then
Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter prior to the Title
Claim Date as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by this Article 3 and
shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach
of any such representation or warranty.

(h) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by such Title 



 

27 _Execution Version_



 

 Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and
shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and
conditions:

(i) if Purchaser and DRI agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount shall
be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the
appropriate Sellers or Companys interest in the affected Title Defect
Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest
stated in Schedule 3.4, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the Net Revenue Interest decrease and
the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4;

(iv) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the Net Mineral
Acres for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Mineral Acres stated in
Schedule 3.4, the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Net Mineral Acre decrease for such Title Defect Property and
the denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres of such Title Defect
Property stated in Schedule 3.4;

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and DRI
and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, the foregoing considerations notwithstanding,
in the event that the Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured,
the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and
expense of curing such Title Defect;

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives
credit in the calculation of the Purchase Price; and

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

(i) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the greater of:
(A) the product of the Allocated Value of the affected lease or well
multiplied by a fraction, the 



 

28 _Execution Version_



 

 numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in Schedule 3.4; and (B) the
product of the Allocated Value of the affected lease or well multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Mineral Acres increase for such
lease or well, and the denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres of such
lease or well stated in Schedule 3.4,  _provided_ that if the Title Benefit
does not affect a lease or well throughout the entire life of such lease or
well, the Title Benefit Amount determined under this Section 3.5(i) shall be
reduced to take into account the applicable time period only.

(j) DRI and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects and Title
Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, respectively,
prior to Closing. If DRI and Purchaser are unable to agree on Title Defects
and Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts,
respectively, by the scheduled Closing, then Sellers good faith estimate
shall be used to determine the Closing Payment pursuant to Section 8.4(a). If,
after the Remedy Deadline, DRI and Purchaser are unable to agree on an alleged
Title Defect/Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount/Title Benefit Amount (the "
_Disputed Title Matters_ ") such dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall
be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following
provisions of this Section 3.5(j).

(i) Purchaser shall provide to DRI by not later than the tenth (10th) Business
Day following the Remedy Deadline a written description meeting the
requirements of Section 3.5(a) or Section 3.5(b), as applicable, together with
all supporting documentation, of the Disputed Title Matters. By not later than
ten (10) Business Days after DRIs receipt of Purchasers written description
of the Disputed Title Matters, DRI shall provide to Purchaser a written
response setting forth DRIs position with respect to the Disputed Title
Matters together with all supporting documentation, including a written
description meeting the requirements of Section 3.5(b) in the case of any
Title Benefit Amount asserted by DRI.

(ii) By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Purchasers receipt of
DRIs written response to Purchasers written description of the Disputed
Title Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any
such dispute(s) by written notice to DRI of any Disputed Title Matters ("
_Final Disputed Title Matters_ ") not otherwise resolved or waived that are to
be resolved by arbitration (the " _Title Arbitration Notice_ ").

(iii) The arbitration shall be held before a one (1) or three (3) member
arbitration panel (" _Title Arbitration Panel_ "), determined as follows. Each
member of the panel shall be an attorney with at least ten (10) years
experience examining oil and gas titles in Pennsylvania or West Virginia.
Within two (2) Business Days following DRIs receipt of the Title Arbitration
Notice, DRI and Purchaser shall each exchange lists of five (5) acceptable,
qualified arbitrators. Within two (2) Business Days following the exchange of
lists of acceptable arbitrators, Purchaser and DRI shall select by mutual
agreement one (1) arbitrator from the combined lists. If no such agreement is
reached, Purchaser and DRI shall each, by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time of the
second (2nd) Business Day identify a single arbitrator from their original
list of five (5) acceptable arbitrators. The two (2) selected arbitrators
shall then together select a third arbitrator within three (3) 



 

29 _Execution Version_



 

 Business Days following their selection, which shall be no more than seven
(7) Business Days following the Title Arbitration Notice.

(iv) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the Title
Arbitration Panel, the Parties shall submit one copy to each member of the
Title Arbitration Panel of (A) this Agreement, with specific reference to this
Section 3.5(j), (B) the Purchasers written description of the Final Disputed
Title Matters together with the supporting documents that were provided to
DRI, (C) DRIs written response to the Purchasers written description of the
Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents that were
provided to Purchaser, and (D) the Title Arbitration Notice. Within five (5)
Business Days following such submissions, each of the Parties may submit one
written response to the other Partys submission. The Title Arbitration Panel
shall resolve the Final Disputed Title Matters based only on the foregoing
submissions. Neither Purchaser nor DRI shall have the right to submit
additional documentation to the Title Arbitration Panel nor to demand
discovery on the other Party.

(v) The Title Arbitration Panel shall choose a location convenient for
deliberation, or may deliberate by telephone conference. The Title
Arbitration Panel shall make its determination by written decision within
thirty (30) Business Days following DRIs receipt of the Title Arbitration
Notice (the " _Arbitration Decision_ "). The Arbitration Decision shall be
final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its
determination, the Title Arbitration Panel shall be bound by the rules set
forth in Section 3.5(h) and Section 3.5(i). The Title Arbitration Panel may
consult with and engage disinterested third Persons to advise the Title
Arbitration Panel, but shall disclose to the Parties the identities of such
consultants. Any such consultant shall not have worked as an employee
or consultant for either Party or its Affiliates during the five (5) year
period preceding the arbitration nor have any financial interest in the
dispute.

(vi) The Title Arbitration Panel shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defects and Title Defect
Amounts or Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts and shall not be empowered
to award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter.

(vii) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
preparing and presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half (50%) of
the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitration Panel, including any costs
incurred by the Title Arbitration Panel that are attributable to the
consultation of any third Person.

(viii) DRI and Purchaser shall implement the Arbitration Decision as follows:
(A) in the case of alleged Title Defects determined to be Title Defects, DRI
shall remedy, at its sole election, such Title Defects pursuant to Section
3.5(c) within ten (10) Business Days following DRIs receipt of the
Arbitration Decision, and (B) in the case of disputed Title Benefits and
Title Benefit Amounts or Title Defect Amounts, any amounts determined to be
owed by either Party shall be accounted for in the determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8.4. Any alleged Title Defects/Title
Benefits determined not to be Title Defects/Title Benefits under the
Arbitration Decision shall be final and binding as not being Title
Defects/Title Benefits. The Parties shall complete 



 

30 _Execution Version_



 

 any further conveyancing or reconveyancing of property as is necessary to
effect the remedy chosen by DRI pursuant to subsection (A) above. In the case
of any such reconveyancing, Purchaser shall assign the relevant lease or well
to DRI or any other Person designated by DRI with a special warranty of title,
subject to the Permitted Encumbrances ( _mutatis mutandis_ ), by, through, and
under Purchaser.

(ix) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this Section 3.5(j)
shall be decided by the Title Arbitration Panel with reference to the Laws of
the State of Delaware. Any award of the Title Arbitration Panel may be
enforced against both Parties in the Delaware Chancery Court, or any other
state in which any Party holds or owns property of any kind. 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price, or other remedies
available under Section 3.5(d): (i) for any Title Defect Amount with respect
to an individual Title Defect Property: (A) in the case of a Marcellus Lease,
if such amount does not exceed Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand dollars
($250,000) or, (B) in the case of a Well, if such amount does not exceed One
Million dollars ($1,000,000) (each, an " _Individual Title Threshold_ "); and
(ii) unless the aggregate amount of all such Title Defect Amounts (
_provided_ that each such Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title
Threshold), in the aggregate (excluding any Title Defect Amounts with respect
to Title Defects cured or indemnified by DRI in accordance with this Section
3.5) exceeds 1.0% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Aggregate Title
Deductible_ "), after which point, subject to the Individual Title Threshold,
Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies elected by DRI in accordance with Section 3.5(d) only with respect to
Title Defects in excess of such Aggregate Title Deductible; _provided_ that
the aggregate amount of all Title Benefit Amounts shall be credited
against and reduce any Title Defect Amounts in excess of the Aggregate Title
Deductible. In the event the aggregate amount of Title Benefit Amounts equals
or exceeds the aggregate amount of Title Defect Amounts in excess of the
Aggregate Title Deductible, neither Party shall be entitled to an adjustment
of the Purchase Price with respect to any Title Defect Amounts or Title
Benefit Amounts.

(l) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties rights or obligations in
respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully
in Section 12.20, time is of the essence in performing their obligations and
exercising their rights under this Section 3.5, and, as such, that each and
every date and time by which such performance or exercise is due shall be the
firm and final date and time.

Section 3.6 _Limitations on Applicability_. The right of Purchaser or DRI to
assert a Title Defect or Title Benefit, respectively, under this Agreement
shall terminate on the Title Claim Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that until
the alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit or Title Defect Amount or Title
Benefit Amount, as the case may be, is resolved in accordance with this
Agreement there shall be no termination of Purchasers or DRIs rights under
this Article 3 with respect to any alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit or
Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount properly reported in accordance
with Section 3.5 on or before the Title Claim Date.



 

31 _Execution Version_



 

Section 3.7 _Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase_.

(a) Promptly after the Execution Date, DRI shall prepare and send (i) notices
to the holders of any required consents to assignment that are set forth on
Schedule 4.14 requesting consents to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) notices to the holders of any applicable preferential
rights to purchase or similar rights that are set forth on Schedule 4.14 in
compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting waivers of such
rights. Any preferential purchase right must be exercised subject to all terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The consideration payable under
this Agreement for any particular Asset for purposes of preferential purchase
right notices shall be the Allocated Value for such Asset. DRI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment and
waivers of preferential rights to purchase or similar rights (or the exercise
thereof) to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing, _provided_ that DRI
and its Affiliates shall not be required to make payments or undertake
obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to
obtain the required consents and waivers. Purchaser shall cooperate, and after
Closing shall cause the Companies and Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries to cooperate,
with DRI in seeking to obtain such consents to assignment and waivers of
preferential rights.

(b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a
consent requirement has not been satisfied and for which transfer is
prohibited without such consent or a fee is payable (unless the same has been
paid by Purchaser). In cases in which the Asset subject to such a requirement
is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the Mineral Interest(s) to which the
Contract relates, but the Contract is not transferred to Purchaser due to the
unwaived consent requirement, Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent so that such Contract
can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the consent, the Contract
shall be held by Sellers for the benefit of Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay all
amounts due thereunder, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the
performance of any obligations under such Contract to the extent that
Purchaser has been transferred the Assets necessary to perform under such
Contract until such consent is obtained. In cases in which the Asset subject
to such a requirement is a Mineral Interest or a Well and the third-party
consent to the transfer of the Mineral Interest or Well is not obtained by
Closing, Purchaser may elect to treat the unsatisfied consent requirements as
a Title Defect (disregarding the Individual Title Threshold and Aggregate
Title Deductible) and receive the appropriate adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price under Section 2.3 by giving DRI written notice thereof in
accordance with Section 3.5(a), except that such notice may be given up to
six (6) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date. If an unsatisfied
consent requirement with respect to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price is made under Section 3.5 is subsequently satisfied prior to
the date of the final adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price under
Section 8.4(b), Sellers shall be reimbursed in that final adjustment for the
amount of any previous deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price, the
Mineral Interest or Well, if not previously transferred to Purchaser under the
first sentence of this Section 3.7(b), shall be transferred, and the
provisions of this Section 3.7 shall no longer apply to such
consent requirement.

(c) If any preferential right to purchase any Assets is exercised prior to
Closing, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Allocated Value for
such Assets, the affected Assets shall not be transferred at Closing if owned
by DTI, and the affected Assets shall

 be deemed to be deleted from Exhibits A-1, A-2, B-1 or B-2 to this
Agreement, as applicable, for all purposes.

(d) Should a third Person fail to exercise or waive its preferential right to
purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing and the time for
exercise or waiver has not yet expired, then subject to the remaining
provisions of this Section 3.7, such Assets shall be included in the
transaction at Closing, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price at
Closing with respect to such preferential right to purchase, and DRI shall,
at its sole expense, continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the waiver of the preferential purchase rights and shall continue to be
responsible for the compliance therewith as set forth in Section 3.7(a).

 

(e) Should the holder of the preferential purchase right validly exercise same
(whether before or after Closing), then:

(i) If the affected Assets are owned by DTI, DTI shall convey them to the
holder on the terms and provisions set out in the applicable preferential
right provision. If the affected Assets were previously transferred to
Purchaser at Closing by DTI, Purchaser agrees to transfer the affected Assets
back to DTI on the terms and provisions set out herein to permit DTI
to comply with its obligation (or, if DTI requests, Purchaser shall transfer
the affected Assets directly to the holder on the terms and provisions set out
in the applicable preferential purchase right provision);

(ii) If the affected Assets are owned by either Company or any Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary, such Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as applicable, shall
transfer them to the holder on the terms and provisions set out in the
applicable preferential purchase right provision. If Closing has already
occurred, Purchaser shall cause such Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as
applicable, to perform this obligation;

(iii) Pursuant to Section 2.3(b), the applicable Seller(s) shall credit
Purchaser with the Allocated Value of any Asset transferred pursuant to
Section 3.7(e)(i) or (e)(ii) (or, if the transfer of the Asset occurs after
the Cut-Off Date, Sellers shall promptly refund to Purchaser the Allocated
Value in respect of such Asset);

(iv) Such Seller(s) shall be entitled to the consideration paid by such holder
(which shall, if received by either Company or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary
after Closing, be paid to such Seller(s) by such Company or Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary, as applicable, or by Purchaser as agent for and on behalf of such
Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as applicable);

(v) If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at
Closing, Purchaser shall account for revenues earned and costs incurred by it
or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Assets during the period from
the Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, which the Parties agree
shall be calculated in the same manner as the adjustments in Section 2.3 with
such changes as are necessary to reflect Purchasers, direct or indirect,
ownership of such Assets during such period. The net amount of any 



 

33 _Execution Version_



 

 adjustment under this Section 3.7(e)(v), if positive, shall be paid by
Purchaser to such Seller and, if negative, by such Seller to Purchaser; and

(vi) If the affected Assets were previously transferred to Purchaser at
Closing, the Seller that transferred such Assets (or the Shares of the
Company holding such Assets) shall assume all obligations assumed by Purchaser
with respect to such Assets under Section 11.1, and shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Purchaser from all Damages incurred by Purchaser caused by
or arising out of or resulting from the ownership, use or operation of such
Asset from the Closing Date to the date of the reconveyance, excluding,
however, any such Damages resulting from any violation of any Law caused by
the actions of, or implementation of policies or procedures of, Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, including any Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, after
Closing, breach of any contract by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
including any Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, after Closing, or gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
including any Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary after Closing.

and expenses between (x) the EandP Business and the Assumed Seller
Obligations and (y) the Excluded Assets, the other assets and liabilities of
DTI, DEPI and Reserves not being transferred to or assumed by Purchaser, or
otherwise retained by the Sellers or their Affiliates (excluding, after the
Closing, the Companies and the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries), including the
Retained Seller Obligations.

Section 4.5 _Labor Matters and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Labor Matters_. Neither of the Companies maintains or sponsors (or has
any obligation to maintain or sponsor) any Employee Plan, any other "employee
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or any other
compensation arrangement with a current or former employee. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.5(a), there are no employment agreements, change of
control agreements, severance agreements, retention agreements, or similar
agreements with any Business Employee. All Business Employees and the
Executives are employed by either DEPI or DRS. DEPI and DRS have no
collective bargaining agreements or other labor agreement with any labor
union, works council or organization with respect to any of the Business
Employees or the Executives. No consent, approval or authorization from any
labor organization is required for the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by DEPI, DRS, DRI and DTI and/or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. As of the Execution Date, to the knowledge
of DRI, DEPI, DRS, and DTI: (A) no labor organization or group of the
Business Employees has made a demand for recognition or certification as a
union or other labor organization with respect to any of the Business
Employees, and (B) there are no representation or certification proceedings
or petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or
threatened to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or
any labor relations tribunal or authority with respect to any of such
employees. To DRIs knowledge, there are no organizing activities. As of the
Execution Date, there are no (and during the two year period preceding the
date of this Agreement, there have not been any) strikes, work stoppages,
slowdowns, material arbitrations, material grievances or other material labor
disputes pending or, to DRIs knowledge, threatened, involving the Business
Employees.

(b) _Employee Benefits_.

(i) Schedule 4.5(b)(i) lists all of the Employee Plans.

(ii) All Employee Plans subject to ERISA and the Code comply with ERISA, the
Code and, as applicable, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, the Family and Medical Leave Act
of 1993, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, except
such non-compliance as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.



 

38 _Execution Version_



 

(iii) All Employee Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the
Code have received favorable determination letters with respect to such
qualified status from the Internal Revenue Service. The determination letter
for each such Employee Plan remains in effect, and, to DRIs knowledge, no
event relating to such an Employee Plan subsequent to the date of such
determination letter has occurred that could materially and adversely affect
the qualified status of the Employee Plan.

(iv) No Employee Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a " _Title IV
Plan_ ") or Section 412 of the Code has incurred an accumulated funding
deficiency, whether or not waived, within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and to DRIs knowledge, no condition exists
which would be expected to result in an accumulated funding deficiency as of
the last day of the current plan year of any Title IV Plan or other Employee
Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code. The PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Title IV Plan, and no other event or condition
has occurred which might constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such
Title IV Plan.

(v) Neither Sellers, DEPI nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or reasonably
expects to incur any liability for withdrawal from a Multiemployer Plan that
could result in Purchaser or its Affiliates incurring any liability.

(vi) Based on current Law, there does not now exist, nor do any circumstances
exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a
liability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies)
following the Closing, other than with respect to any Purchaser Employee
Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither DRI nor any
of its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged
in any transaction described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of
ERISA.

Section 4.6 _Accuracy of Data_. The historical factual information, excluding
title information, supplied by Sellers to Ryder Scott and Co. in the preparation
of its report dated as of December 31, 2009 (the " _Audited Reserve Report_ ")

or pay payment, advance payment or other similar payment (other than

thereof,

 attributable to the Sellers or Companys interest in the Properties at some
future time without receiving payment therefor at or after the time of
delivery.

Section 4.13 _Production Imbalances_. Except in the amounts set forth on
Schedule 4.13, as of the dates set forth on such Schedule, there were no

Section 4.14 _Consents and Preferential Purchase Rights_. There are
no preferential rights to purchase or required third-party consents to

Subsidiary, which may be applicable to the sale of Shares and Additional
Assets by Sellers as contemplated by this Agreement, except for consents and
approvals of Governmental Authorities that are customarily obtained after
Closing, those approvals described in Section 6.7, and as set forth on
Schedule 4.14.

Section 4.15 _Liability for Brokers  Fees_. Purchaser and the Companies shall

in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or
any agreement or transaction contemplated hereby.

Section 4.16 _Equipment and Personal Property_.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16(a), all currently producing Wells
and Equipment are in an operable state of repair adequate to maintain normal
operations in accordance with past practices, ordinary wear and tear excepted.
DTI, each Company and each Wholly-Owned Subsidiary have all (i) Governmental
Authorizations and (ii) material easements, rights of way, licenses and
authorizations, in each case necessary to access, construct, operate, maintain
and repair the Wells and Equipment in the ordinary course of business as
currently conducted by such Persons and in material compliance with all Laws,
except such failures as would not individually or in the aggregate have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) With respect to Additional Equipment, Hydrocarbon production and
inventory, DTIs title (or leasehold interest, as applicable) as of the
Execution Date is, and as of the Closing Date, shall be transferred to
Purchaser, free and clear of liens and encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. To DRIs knowledge, the Sellers, Companies or Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries have such title to (or, in the case of a leasehold interest,
such legally enforceable rights to use) the Midstream Assets as would be
deemed adequate by a reasonable and prudent producer owning similar assets in
the Appalachian Area.

4.17, since December 31, 2009, the Assets have been operated only in the

43 _Execution Version_



 

Section 4.18 _Non-Consent Operations_. No Seller, Company or Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary has elected not to participate in any operation or activity
proposed with respect to the Assets which could result in any of such Persons

of such election not to participate in such operation or activity, except to
the extent reflected in the Net Revenue Interest and Working Interest for such
Asset set forth in Exhibit A-2 or Exhibit B-2.

Section 4.19 _Outstanding Capital Commitments_. As of the Execution Date,
there are no outstanding authorizations for expenditure or other commitments
for capital expenditures (except as expressly set forth in the terms of a
Contract, a copy of which has been provided to Purchaser) which are binding on
any Seller, Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary with respect to any Asset and
which DRI reasonably anticipates will individually require expenditures by the
owner of such Asset after the Closing Date in excess of Two Million dollars
($2,000,000).

Section 4.20 _Insurance_. Schedule 4.20 lists all the insurance policies
maintained by Sellers, the Companies and the Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries, and

respect to the Assets.

has not been any reduction in the rate of production of Hydrocarbons from the
Properties which would constitute a Material Adverse Effect, (b) there has
not been any reduction or write-down in the reserves estimated for the
Properties (which reduction or write-down is not reflected in the Reserve
Report) that would constitute a Material Adverse Effect, (c) there has not
been any damage, destruction or loss with respect to the Assets that would
constitute a Material Adverse Effect that is not addressed by the terms of
Section 11.4, and (d) the Assets have not become subject to any obligation
or liability that would be required to be reflected as an extraordinary item
separately listed on an income statement for the EandP Business prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles.

Owned Subsidiary has obtained and is maintaining all material Governmental

that (i) are subject to an order from any Governmental Authority requiring
that such Well be plugged and abandoned; (ii) have been plugged and abandoned

properly permitted by the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
thereover; or (iv) have been produced in excess of allowables allocated
thereto by the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction thereover. 

Section 4.24 _Assets of the Business_. The Company Assets include all
equipment, materials, contracts, leases, data, records, rights, interests and
all other property reasonably necessary for the continued operation, following
the Closing, of the oil and gas and exploration and production business and
operations of the Companies and the Wholly-Owned

copy, at Purchasers expense, the Records in Sellers possession, for the

entitled to receive any proceeds (and Purchaser shall provide DRI with its
reasonable cooperation in connection with such actions) to allow Purchaser to
benefit from any insurance proceeds payable to the Companies or any Wholly-
Owned Subsidiary as a named insured under any occurrence based liability and
property insurance policies of DRI or its Affiliates that name the Companies
or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary as a named insured. Purchaser shall reimburse
DRI and its Affiliates for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

to access to the Assets prior to the Closing by Purchaser, its Affiliates, or
its or their directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, even

conveyed or assigned to Purchaser by DTI at Closing or (y) not conveyed or
assigned by a Company (or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) to Sellers prior to the
Closing; or

(ii) any (A) assets of the Existing Business, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company Assets, that were (x) used or held for use by Sellers or 



 

55 _Execution Version_



 

 their Affiliates prior to the Closing or (y) conveyed or assigned by a

practicable thereafter, (x) in the case of an asset described in Section
6.13(b)(i), Purchaser shall (or cause the applicable Company or Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary to) convey such asset to DTI, or (y) in the case of an asset
described in Section 6.13(b)(ii), the applicable Seller shall convey such
asset to Purchaser (or its designee), in each case without the payment of any
additional amounts. In the case of any such reconveyancing pursuant to

special warranty of title, subject to any Permitted Encumbrances ( _mutatis
mutandis_ ), by, through and under Purchaser. In the case of any
such conveyancing pursuant to Section 6.13(b)(ii), Sellers shall assign the
relevant asset to Purchaser (or its designee) pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 6.14 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Schedule 6.14(a) lists the Business Employees as of the Execution Date,
which is subject to changes due only to hirings, terminations and resignations
in the ordinary course, consistent with Sellers customary employment
practices. Within fifteen (15) days after the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall make offers of employment, effective as of the Closing Date,
with respect to the Service Employees. Commencing on the Closing Date and
continuing through the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to each Transferred
Employee (i) levels of total compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and
benefits that are comparable, in the aggregate, to such
Transferred Employees compensation (base pay and payroll practices) and
benefits in effect as of the Closing Date, and (ii) at a work location no more
than fifty (50) miles from the individuals work location as of the Closing
Date. In determining comparability for the twelve (12)-month period following
the Closing, (i) in no event will the base pay and annual incentive bonus
opportunity for each such employee be less than his or her base pay and annual
incentive bonus opportunity with DEPI or DRS, as applicable, as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) any long-term incentive opportunity, retention plans,
equity-based programs, Six Sigma Black Belt Incentive Program or spot cash
award programs listed on Schedule 4.5(b)(i) shall be excluded. The Service
Employees who accept such offer of employment and the individuals employed by
DEPI as of the Closing Date shall all be considered " _Transferred
Employees_." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, with respect to each Business Employee who, as of the Closing Date,
(w) applied and was selected to participate in the Dominion 2010 Non-Union
Voluntary Separation Program, (x) is receiving benefits under the Dominion
Resources, Inc. Long-Term Disability Plan or similar plan, (y) has otherwise
been on a leave of absence for more than one hundred eighty (180) days and has
no legally mandated right to return to employment, or (z) is eligible to
retire and does retire effective as of the Closing Date (any 



 

56 _Execution Version_



 

 such Business Employee, a " _Leave/Retiree Employee_ "), (I) Purchaser shall
have no obligation to make an employment offer and (II) such Leave/Retiree
Employee shall not be a Transferred Employee. Sellers shall take all actions
necessary to transfer the employment, effective prior to the Closing Date, of
any Leave/Retiree Employee who is not a Service Employee to one or more
Sellers or one or more Affiliates of Sellers, other than the Companies.
Sellers shall retain all liabilities relating to or arising out of the
employment of any Business Employee (including any Leave/Retiree Employee) who
does not become a Transferred Employee.

(b) Purchaser and its Affiliates may offer to employ any Executive; _provided_
, _however_ , that any offer to the Qualifying Offer Executive must be a
"qualifying offer" as specified in Part I of Schedule 6.14(a). If Purchaser
and its Affiliates make an offer to any Executive, such offer shall be made no
later than the date for making offers to Service Employees as specified in
Section 6.14(a), and, if (x) such offer is accepted and (y) the Executive
subsequently experiences a termination of employment that entitles the
Executive to severance benefits under Part II of Schedule 6.14(b), the
Executive shall be entitled to severance benefits from the Purchaser or its
Affiliate that are equal to or greater than those specified in Part II of
Schedule 6.14(b), subject to such Executives execution of a release of claims
with respect to Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies). Any
such Executive who accepts such offer and becomes an employee of Purchaser or
its Affiliates shall be considered a "Transferred Employee."

(c) Except with respect to the Executives, if, within twelve (12) months of
the Closing Date, the employment of any Transferred Employee is involuntarily
terminated, other than for cause, or such Transferred Employee resigns by
reason of the relocation, without his or her consent, of his or her work
location more than fifty (50) miles from the individuals work location as of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, the
terminated Transferred Employee with whichever of the following results in the
greater value to such Transferred Employee (subject, in each case, to
such terminated Transferred Employee executing a release of claims with
respect to Purchaser and its Affiliates): (i) salary continuation and health
benefits until the end of the twelve (12) month period following the Closing
Date, or (ii) severance benefits which are comparable, in the aggregate, to
the severance benefits set forth on Schedule 6.14(c) and which, with respect
to salary continuation, health benefits, outplacement services and annual
incentive plan payment are no less than the benefits set forth on Schedule
6.14(c).

(d) If an Executive who does not accept an offer of employment that complies
with the requirements of Section 6.14(b) is employed by Purchaser or its
Affiliates within twenty-four (24) months of the Closing Date, then Purchaser
or its Affiliates shall pay promptly to Sellers an amount equal to the
aggregate of the cash severance and other severance related compensation and
benefits provided to such Executive by Sellers or their Affiliates, if any, in
connection with the termination of such Executives employment with Sellers. 

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, all Transferred Employees shall cease to
be active participants in all Employee Plans and shall cease to accrue
additional benefits under such plans for any periods after the Closing Date.
Effective as of the Closing Date, DEPI shall cease to be a participating
employer in all Employee Plans.



 

57 _Execution Version_



 

(f) As of the Closing Date, all Transferred Employees shall, if applicable, be
eligible to participate in and, if elected, shall commence participation in
the employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA),
programs, policies, fringe benefits, or arrangements (whether written or
unwritten), including, but not limited to, the tax-qualified defined benefit
plan (" _Purchaser s Pension Plan_"), defined contribution plan, retiree
medical plan and retiree life plan, of Purchaser or its Affiliates
(collectively, " _Purchaser Employee Plans_ "). Purchaser shall, to the
extent permissible under any Purchaser Employee Plan (provided that Purchaser
shall use reasonable efforts to remove any restrictions including restrictions
in any insurance policy), waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to Transferred Employees and their
spouses and dependents, if applicable, under the Purchaser Employee Plans.
Purchaser shall, to the extent permissible under any Purchaser Employee Plan
(provided that Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to remove any
restrictions under any Purchaser Employee Plan or related insurance policy),
provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductible or
out of pocket requirements under Purchaser Employee Plans for the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs, provided that Sellers provide to Purchaser, as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, an electronic file with the paid
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to Closing. Purchaser shall cause to be
provided to each Transferred Employee credit for prior service with Seller or
its Affiliates for purposes of retiree medical and life insurance eligibility
and for purposes of retiree medical contributions, and, with respect to
Transferred Employees, Purchaser shall cause the eligibility requirements of
Purchasers retiree medical plan and retiree life insurance plan to be age 55
or older with at least ten (10) years of pension service.

(g) Purchaser shall accept or cause to be accepted transfers from DRIs or
any ERISA Affiliates health care flexible spending account plan of each
Transferred Employees account balance as of the Closing Date and credit such
employee with such amounts under the applicable Purchaser Employee Plan,
provided that Sellers provide to Purchaser, as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, an electronic file with the necessary data. On and after the
Closing Date, Transferred Employees shall have no further claim for
reimbursement under DRIs or any ERISA Affiliates health care flexible
spending account and all claims must be submitted under the applicable
Purchaser Employee Plan, including expenses incurred prior to the Closing
Date. 

(h) Purchaser shall cause to be provided to each Transferred Employee credit
for prior service with DRI or its Affiliates for all purposes (including
vesting, eligibility, benefit accrual and/or level of benefits) in all
Purchaser Employee Plans (other than defined benefit pension plans and any
non-qualified plan provided for a select group of management or
highly compensated employees), including fringe benefit plans, vacation and
sick leave policies, severance plans or policies, defined contribution pension
plans, retiree medical plans and matching contributions under defined
contribution plans maintained or provided by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate
after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as expressly
provided in this Section 6.14, such service need not be recognized (i) to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service, or (ii) for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of
benefits or 



 

58 _Execution Version_



 

 participation, and; _provided further_ , that Section 6.14(i) of this
Agreement exclusively shall govern the treatment of Transferred Employees
under Purchasers Pension Plan. 

(i) Each Transferred Employees benefit under Purchasers Pension Plan shall
be equal to the greater of (i) or (ii), where:

(i) equals (A) minus (B), where: (A) equals the accrued pension benefit for
such Transferred Employee under Purchasers Pension Plan as calculated as of
such Transferred Employees retirement or termination date from Purchaser and
its Affiliates, taking into account service credit earned from DRI or any
ERISA Affiliate through the Closing Date, plus service credit and
compensation earned under Purchasers Pension Plan from the Closing Date until
such Transferred Employees retirement or termination date; and (B) equals the
accrued normal retirement benefit of such Transferred Employee under the
Dominion Pension Plan as of the Closing Date; and

(ii) equals the accrued pension benefit for such Transferred Employee under
Purchasers Pension Plan as calculated as of such Transferred Employees
retirement or termination date from Purchaser and its Affiliates, taking into
account service credit and compensation earned under Purchasers Pension Plan
only and only from the Closing Date. Vesting service under Purchasers Pension
Plan will include service earned under Purchasers Pension Plan from the
Closing Date plus service earned from DRI or any ERISA Affiliate through the
Closing Date.

In the case of the commencement of payment of benefits under Purchasers
Pension Plan to a Transferred Employee prior to normal retirement, such
Transferred Employees benefit under Purchasers Pension Plan determined
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 6.14(i) shall be reduced using
the applicable early commencement factors under Purchasers Pension Plan as of
the date that payment commences with respect to such Transferred Employee.

(j) At the time of Closing, Sellers shall pay to each Transferred Employee all
earned but unused vacation earned as of the Closing Date with respect to any
year prior to 2010, as determined under any and all of the Sellers time off
policies. Each Transferred Employee shall be entitled in 2010 to the greater
of (i) such Transferred Employees earned but unused vacation, as of the
Closing Date, with respect to calendar year 2010 under Sellers vacation
policy, or (ii) the number of vacation days with respect to calendar year 2010
to which such Transferred Employee is entitled under Purchasers
vacation policy, less any 2010 vacation days used by such Transferred
Employee prior to the Closing Date. No Transferred Employee will be allowed to
carry forward any unused vacation time beyond 2010 unless allowed under
Purchasers vacation policy. With respect to each year after 2010, Purchaser
shall consider each Transferred Employees prior full-time service with
Sellers in determining the amount of vacation the Transferred Employee will be
eligible for under Purchasers vacation policy. Transferred Employees will be
eligible to participate in Purchasers Short Term Disability and Long Term
Disability Plans on the Closing Date.

(k) To the extent allowable by law, Purchaser shall take any and all necessary
action to cause the trustee of a defined contribution plan of Purchaser or one
of its Affiliates, if requested to do so by a Transferred Employee, to accept
a direct "rollover" of all or a portion of 



 

59 _Execution Version_



 

 such employees distribution from the Dominion Salaried Savings Plan;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall be required to accept a rollover
of a Transferred Employees plan loans only if such Transferred Employee
rolls over 100% of such Transferred Employees distribution from the Dominion
Salaried Savings Plan. Except for plan loans, all "rollovers" shall be made in
cash and shall be subject to such administrative terms determined by
Purchaser, including with respect to timing of any such "rollover."

(l) As of the Closing Date, DRI or the applicable ERISA Affiliate shall take
all necessary action to cause the Sellers Pension Plan and the Dominion
Salaried Savings Plan to fully vest the Transferred Employees in their accrued
benefits and/or account balances under such plans.

(m) Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to provide payments and benefits to
Transferred Employees, in accordance with the terms of Purchasers or its
Affiliates educational assistance and adoption assistance programs, with
respect to classes and adoption proceedings, respectively, commenced prior to
the Closing Date but not completed or finalized until after the Closing Date.

(n) With respect to each Transferred Employee (including any beneficiary or
the dependent thereof), Sellers shall retain all liabilities and obligations
arising under any Seller medical, dental, vision, life insurance or accident
insurance benefit plans to the extent that such liability or obligation
relates to claims incurred (whether or not reported or paid) prior to the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 6.14(n), a claim shall be deemed to
be incurred (i) with respect to medical, dental and vision benefits, on the
date that the medical, dental or vision services giving rise to such claim
are performed, (ii) with respect to life insurance, on the date that the death
occurs, and (iii) with respect to accidental death and dismemberment and
business travel accident insurance, on the date that the accident occurs.

(o) With respect to each Transferred Employee who is not actively at work and
who is, as of the Closing Date, receiving any form of pay/wage continuation
(including, but not limited to, short-term sickness, short-term disability,
military leave or vacation pay) or unpaid leave (including, but not limited
to, Family and Medical Leave Act leave or military leave), DRI or the
appropriate ERISA Affiliate shall be responsible for any such payments due
prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser shall be responsible for any payments
due on or after the Closing Date.

(p) Purchaser shall assume workers compensation liabilities and obligations
for Transferred Employees (i) for occupational illnesses with respect to
which the date of last exposure was on or after the Closing Date and (ii) for
injuries that occur on or after the Closing Date. Sellers shall retain
workers compensation liabilities and obligations for Transferred Employees
(x) for occupational illnesses with respect to which the date of last exposure
was prior to the Closing Date and (y) for injuries that occur prior to the
Closing Date.

(q) DRI or the ERISA Affiliate shall be responsible for providing coverage
under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (" _COBRA_ ") to any
Business Employee (including any Transferred Employee), his or her spouse or
dependent person as to 



 

60 _Execution Version_



 

 whom a "qualifying event" as defined in Section 4890B of the Code has
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date.

(r) If a plant closing or a mass layoff occurs or is deemed to occur with
respect to the Transferred Employees at any time on or after the Closing,
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2109 _et
seq._ or the regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _WARN Act_ ") and for
taking all remedial measures, including, without limitation, the payment of
all amounts, penalties, liabilities, costs and expenses if such notices are
not provided.

(s) DRI shall pay to each eligible Transferred Employee a prorated payment, if
any, in accordance with the Annual Incentive Plan for the period from January
1 through the Closing Date for the year in which the Closing occurs based on
actual results of the applicable performance goals for that year. Purchaser
shall pay to each eligible Transferred Employee a prorated payment, if any,
under the Purchasers incentive plan for the period from the Closing Date
through December 31 of the year in which the Closing occurs based on actual
results of the applicable performance goals for that year. Any payment
pursuant to this Section 6.14(s) shall be made not later than March 15th of
the calendar year following the year in which the Closing occurs.

(t) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.14, neither Purchaser nor
its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall have, and Sellers shall retain,
any liability or obligations (i) based upon or arising under any Employee
Plan, or (ii) with respect to any current or former employee of Sellers or
their Affiliates (including the Companies). Sellers shall retain any and all
Controlled Group Liability and any and all liabilities, assets and
obligations that arise under any Employee Plans, including without limitation,
those Employee Plans that provide for post-retirement benefits (x) that are
defined benefit pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code, (y) that are defined contribution plans as defined in Section 3(34)
of ERISA, or (z) that relate to other post-employment benefits

(u) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to amend any Employee Plan or affect
DRIs or any ERISA Affiliates right to amend or terminate any Employee Plan
pursuant to the terms of such plan. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to
amend any Purchaser Employee Plan or affect Purchasers or any of Purchasers
Affiliates right to amend or terminate any Purchaser Employee Plan pursuant
to the terms of such plan.

 

(v) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Purchaser or the
Companies to continue the employment of any specific person.

(w) The provisions of this Section 6.14 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement.

Section 6.15 _DRI/Purchaser Transition Services Agreement_. Prior to Closing,
Sellers and Purchaser agree to cooperate in good faith to design and
implement a mutually agreeable transition plan with respect to the services
listed on the schedules to the 



 

61 _Execution Version_



 

 DRI/Purchaser Transition Services Agreement.

Section 6.16  _Certain Marketing Agreements_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, DRI shall cause its Affiliate, Dominion Field
Services, Inc. (" _DFS_ "), to enter into amendments with the Companies and
Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the trade confirmations issued
under the Base Purchase Contracts for Short Term Sale and Purchase of Natural

(b) Pursuant to the Appalachian Gateway Agreement, DTI has committed, for a
period of ten years following completion of the Appalachian Gateway, to sell
its production and pay the cost of 16,172 Dth/day of firm capacity (the "
_Firm Commitment_ ") to DFS to secure firm capacity on the Appalachian
Gateway. As a portion of the Firm Commitment is attributable to
the Additional Wells transferred to Purchaser hereunder, the Parties agree as
follows:

(i) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall enter into a new master gas sales
agreement and confirm (the " _New Commitment_ ") to contractually commit
Purchaser to DFS for the volumes attributable to the Additional Wells in each
"pod" (as set forth in Schedule 6.16(b)(i)) (such volume the " _Transferred
Committed Volume_ ") on the material terms set forth in Schedule 6.16(b)(i).

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Execution Date, the
Parties shall cooperate to identify the meters that will be subject to the New
Commitment.

(c) Following the Closing, the Parties agree that the firm capacity
commitments to DFS on the Appalachian Gateway of (A) Purchaser, with respect

(d) The Parties shall enter into the Gas Marketing Agreement at Closing to

Section 6.17 _Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees_. The
Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees,

the Companies and Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries to the extent Sellers or their
Affiliates (except the Companies and Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries) provide
credit support for any such bonds, letters of credit or guarantees) with any
Governmental Authority or third Person and relating to the Companies, the

Closing, the cancellation or return to Sellers of such bonds, letters of
credit and guarantees posted (or supported) by Sellers and such Affiliates,
and Sellers shall provide reasonable cooperation to Purchaser in connection
therewith. Purchaser may also provide evidence that such replacements are not
necessary as a result of existing bonds, letters of credit or guarantees that
Purchaser has 



 

62 _Execution Version_



 

 previously posted as long as such existing bonds, letters of credit or
guarantees are adequate to secure the release of those posted (or supported)
by Sellers. Except for bonds, letters of credit and guarantees related
primarily to the Excluded Assets, Schedule 6.17 identifies the bonds, letters
of credit and guarantees posted (or supported) by Sellers or any other
Affiliate of the Companies (including the Companies and Wholly-
Owned Subsidiaries to the extent Sellers or their Affiliates (except the

(i) (A) the portion of each gathering system (collectively, the " _Additional
Gathering Systems_ ") owned by DTI that is downstream of multiple Additional
Wells or Company Wells (but no other well) and upstream of the first pipeline
interconnect supplying Hydrocarbons from a well owned by any Person other than
the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates (including the Companies or any
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary following the Closing), including an Excluded DEPI
Well, and (B) any assets installed on such gathering system, shall be included
in the Additional Well Line Assets for all purposes under this Agreement and
conveyed to Purchaser by DTI at Closing; and

(ii) (A) the portion of each gathering system (collectively, the " _Excluded
DEPI Gathering Systems_ ") owned by the Companies or any Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary that is downstream of multiple Excluded DEPI Wells (but no other
well) and upstream of the first pipeline interconnect supplying Hydrocarbons
from a well owned by any Person other than Sellers or one of their Affiliates
(excluding the Companies or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary), including any
Additional Well or Company Well, and (B) any assets installed on such
gathering system, shall be included in the Excluded Assets for all purposes
under this Agreement and conveyed to DTI or one of its Affiliates by the
applicable Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing
Date. 

(b) The downstream demarcation point of each Additional Gathering System or
Excluded DEPI Gathering System, as the case may be, shall be the inlet valve
of the Custody Transfer Meter installed adjacent to and upstream of the
interconnect referred to in Section 6.18(a). If no suitable Custody Transfer
Meter is currently installed at such location or the Parties agree that the
nearest Custody Transfer Meter is too far away from the interconnect referred
to in Section 6.18(a), the Parties shall cooperate to identify a suitable
location near such interconnect to install a Custody Transfer Meter for
purposes of measuring volumes attributable to the groups of the Additional
Wells and Company Wells, in the case of an Additional Gathering System, or the
Excluded DEPI Wells, in the case of an Excluded DEPI Gathering System,
upstream of such meter, and the Party that is "off-system" (i.e., the
Purchaser, in the case of an Additional Gathering System, or Sellers, in the
case of an Excluded DEPI Gathering System) shall be responsible for
purchasing, installing and maintaining such meter. 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Execution Date, the
Parties shall meet to (i) identify each Additional Gathering System and each
Excluded DEPI 



 

63 _Execution Version_



 

 Gathering System and (ii) determine the location and schedule for
installation following the Closing of any additional Custody Transfer Meters
required to be installed by the Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, under
Section 6.18(b).

(d) (i) The Parties acknowledge that, following identification
and demarcation of the Additional Gathering Systems and Excluded DEPI
Gathering Systems, there will be situations where:

(A) the Properties are connected upstream of DTIs production pipeline system;

(B) the Excluded DEPI Properties are connected upstream of DEPIs production
pipeline system; or

(C) a combination of the Properties and the Excluded DEPI Properties are
upstream of a field compressor, which services the assets of both Parties; and

Purchaser, the Companies or any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, in the case of
clauses (A) or (C), or DTI, in the case of clauses (B) or (C), may not be able
to access the transmission pipelines necessary to deliver, market or sell
their respective Hydrocarbon production from the Properties or the Excluded
DEPI Properties, respectively, without use of the other Partys facilities.

(ii) With respect to each circumstance described in clause (i) above,
Purchaser and DTI each agree to provide the other Party with access to its (or
its Affiliates, in the case of Purchaser) production pipeline and
compression facilities on the following terms:

(A) if there are any gas handling, pipeline use or compression arrangements
in effect on the Execution Date between the Companies or any Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and DTI, on the other hand, with respect to such
facilities, then access shall be on the terms set forth in such agreement (as
such terms must be modified to account for the transfer (between DTI and DEPI)
of the Properties and Excluded DEPI Properties); but

(B) if there are no existing gas handling, pipeline use or compression
arrangements, then the Parties shall meet to negotiate a mutually acceptable
compression and pipeline use agreement that (1) sets forth the material terms
of the producing Partys access to the production pipeline system and other
midstream assets, including compression, of the other Party and (2)
establishes a mechanism for capacity expansion of such assets. In addition,
in the case of Excluded DEPI Wells, DTI shall use good faith efforts without
cost to DTI to avoid classification of facilities located upstream of the
inlet valve of the Custody Transfer Meter as open access
gathering facilities.

Section 6.19 _Certain Affiliate Agreements_. At or prior to the Closing, the
applicable Seller (or Affiliate of Seller), on the one hand, and the
applicable Company (or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary), on the other hand, shall
terminate each of the agreements (the " _Terminating Agreements_ ") set forth
on Schedule 6.19.

the pledging of the Assets and the making of guarantees by the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries, it being understood that any existing
indebtedness need not be paid off, and any guarantees or
security arrangements need not take effect, until the Closing and (iv)
otherwise reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of the Purchaser
and the Financing Parties for the Financing.

(b) On or prior to the Execution Date, Sellers shall have delivered the
Financial Statements and the Supplemental Financial Statements to Purchaser.

statements as required by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X as to which Deloitte
shall have performed a SAS 100 review no later than April 30, 2010. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.20(a) and (b),
neither the Sellers nor any of their Subsidiaries (including, prior to the

to (i) pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection with the

suffered or incurred by them and any claims made against them in connection
with any action taken by them at the request of Purchaser pursuant to this
Section or in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any filing
made pursuant to the Securities Laws or other disclosures in connection with
the Financing, and this indemnification shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

Section 6.21 _Seismic Licenses_. Until the Cut-Off Date, Sellers shall assist
Purchasers efforts to obtain replacement licenses in the name of Purchaser,
or approval for transfer of the existing licenses, for seismic data relating
solely to the Assets which the Sellers hold under license and the transfer of

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All costs of
such replacement licenses or license transfers and Sellers assistance with

days in the applicable period falling on or before, or after, the Closing
Date. To

Owned Subsidiary shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the

measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another taxable
period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax and (ii) any ad
valorem or property Taxes paid or payable with respect to the Assets shall
be allocated to the taxable period applicable to the ownership of the Assets
regardless of when such Taxes are assessed, and for the avoidance of doubt,

period shall be the calendar year to which the Tax Return relates.

(e) _Production Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, production Taxes and similar Taxes measured by units of
production, and severance Taxes, shall not be subject to this Section 9.1 and

(a) With respect to each Tax return, declaration, report, claim for refund
or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including any schedule
or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof (a " _Tax Return_
") that is required to be filed for, by or with respect to a Company or
Wholly-Owned Subsidiary with respect to a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared and shall
cause the Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary to timely file (assuming it has
authority to do so) such Tax Return with the appropriate Governmental
Authority, and shall timely pay the amount of Taxes shown to be due on such
Tax Return.

(b) With respect to each Tax Return that is required to be filed for, by or
with respect to a Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary with respect to a
Straddle Period, Purchaser shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall
cause each Company to file timely such Tax Return with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, and shall pay timely the amount of Taxes shown to be
due on such Tax Return ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall pay the
Purchaser or its designee in cleared funds an amount equal to all such Taxes

9.1(d) no later than the later of (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the due
date (including extensions) for such Tax Returns and (ii) five (5) Business
Days after the Sellers receipt of notice and supporting work papers (or other
appropriate documentation) from Purchaser of Sellers liability therefor).

(c) Except with respect to any federal income Tax Return, any Tax Return to be
prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Article 9 for a Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
practices, elections, and methods of accounting followed in prior years with
respect to similar Tax Returns for the applicable entity, except for
changes required by changes in Law, subject to the return preparers ethical
and legal obligations under applicable Laws.

(d) With respect to Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period,
if either (i) a Seller or Purchaser may be liable for any material portion of
the Tax payable in connection with such Tax Return to be filed or caused to be
filed by the other after Closing (or, in the case of Purchaser, by any Seller)
(or any Tax item reported on such Tax Return is likely to materially affect
the Tax liability of such Party) or (ii) in any case with respect to any
Straddle Period, the Party responsible under this Agreement for filing such
return or causing such return to be filed (the " _Tax Return Preparer_ ")
shall prepare and deliver to the other Party (the " _Tax Payor_ ") a copy of
such return and any schedules, work papers and other documentation then
available that are relevant to the preparation of the portion of such return
for which the Tax Payor is or may be liable under this Agreement not later
than forty-five (45) days before the date on which the Tax Return is due to be
filed (taking into account any valid extensions) (the " _Due Date_ ") (or, in
the case of ad valorem property Taxes, within thirty (30) days of receipt of
the bill for such ad valorem property Taxes from the applicable Governmental
Authority) or, in the case of any such Tax Returns due within sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable. The Tax Return
Preparer shall not file such return or cause such return to be filed until the
earlier of either the receipt of written notice from the Tax Payor indicating
the Tax Payors consent thereto, or the Due Date. The Tax Payor shall have the
option of providing to the Tax Return Preparer, at any time at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the Due Date, written instructions as to how the Tax Payor
wants any, or all, of the items for which it may be liable reflected on such
Tax Return, provided that such instructions are consistent with Section
9.2(c)). The Tax Return Preparer shall, in preparing such return, but
subject to Section 9.2(c), cause the items for which the Tax Payor is liable
under this Agreement to be reflected in accordance with the Tax Payors
instructions if a partner of a nationally recognized law firm retained by the
Tax Payor will opine that complying with the Tax Payors instructions should
comply with applicable provisions of the Code or state, local or foreign Law
and Section 9.2(c) and, in the absence of having received such instructions,
in accordance with Section 9.2(c).

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any other provision, Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall be entitled to prepare and file all Tax Returns, and
to conduct all Tax Audits, with respect to their operations, assets, and
activities for any Post-Closing Period (other than Straddle Periods of a
Company or the Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries or Straddle Periods with respect to
the Additional Assets) or with respect to any consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a member in such
manner as Purchaser may determine in Purchasers sole discretion; _provided_
, _however_ , that this Section 9.2(e) shall not limit Purchasers liability
under this Agreement for breaches of covenants or agreements contained in
Section 2.2(c), 9.7(b), 9.9, or 11.2(h).

 

Section 9.3 _Tax Sharing Agreement_. Effective as of the Closing, any tax
indemnity, sharing, allocation or similar agreement or arrangement (a " _Tax
Sharing Agreement_ ") that may be in effect prior to the Closing Date between
or among a Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, on the one hand, and its Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be extinguished in full as the Tax
Sharing Agreement relates to such Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, and any
liabilities or rights existing under any such agreement or arrangement by or
with respect to a Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary shall cease to exist and
shall no longer be enforceable as to all past, present and future taxable
periods.

Section 9.4 _Access to Information_.

(a) From and after Closing, each Seller shall grant to Purchaser (or its
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books
and records relating to a Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary within the
possession of the Seller (including work papers and correspondence with taxing
authorities, but excluding work product of and attorney-client
communications with any of Sellers legal counsel and personnel files), and
shall afford Purchaser (or its designees) the right (at Purchasers expense)
to take extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Purchaser (or its designees) to prepare Tax
Returns, to conduct negotiations with Tax authorities, and to implement the
provisions of, or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties
arising under, this Agreement.

(b) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall grant to Sellers (or Sellers
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books
and records relating to the Companies or Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries within the
possession of Purchaser, the Companies or Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries (including
work papers and correspondence with taxing authorities, but excluding work
product of and attorney-client communications with any of Purchasers legal
counsel and personnel files), and shall afford Sellers (or Sellers designees)
the right (at Sellers expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies
thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Sellers (or Sellers
designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to conduct negotiations with, or contest
deficiencies asserted by, Tax authorities, and to implement the provisions of,
or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties arising under,
this Agreement.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will preserve and retain all schedules, work
papers and other documents within the Partys possession relating to any Tax
Returns of or with respect to Taxes of the Companies or Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries or to any claims, audits or other proceedings affecting the
Companies or Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including extensions) applicable to the taxable period to which
such documents relate or until the final determination of any controversy
with respect to such taxable period, and until the final determination of any
payments that may be required with respect to such taxable period under this
Agreement.

(d) At either Purchasers or Sellers request, the other Party shall provide
reasonable access to Purchasers or Sellers, as the case may be, and their
respective Affiliates (including the Companies and Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries) personnel who have knowledge of the information described in
this Section 9.4.

(e) In the case of any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 9, if the Party that is not preparing the Tax Return (or any of
its Affiliates) is required to pay any Taxes shown on the Tax Return, then
the Party preparing the Tax Return shall provide the Party not preparing the
Tax Return with appropriate documentation and computations reasonably
requested by such latter Party supporting the determinations made by the
Party preparing the Tax Return as to the amount of Tax so due by the Party not
preparing the Tax Return (or any of its Affiliates).

Section 9.5 _Contest Provisions_.

(a) From and after Closing, each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand (the " _Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify the chief
tax officer (or other appropriate person) of DRI or Purchaser, as the case may
be, in writing within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the Tax Indemnified
Person of written notice of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments,
claims, examinations, assessments or other proceedings (a " _Tax Audit_ ")
which are likely to affect the liability for Taxes of such other party. If the
Tax Indemnified Person fails to give such timely notice to the other party,
it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in
connection with such Tax Audit if such failure to give notice materially
adversely affects the other partys right to participate in the Tax Audit. 

(b) If such Tax Audit relates to any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period for
which only DRI would be liable to indemnify Purchaser under this Agreement,
DRI shall, at its expense, conduct and control the defense and settlement of
such Tax Audit. If such Tax Audit relates solely to any Post-Closing Period or
Straddle Period for which only Purchaser would be liable under this
Agreement, Purchaser shall conduct and control the defense and settlement of
such Tax Audit.

(c) If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for a Straddle Period for which both
DRI and Purchaser could be liable under this Agreement, to the extent
practicable, such Tax items will be distinguished and each Party shall
control, at its own expense, the defense and settlement of those Taxes for
which it is so liable. If such Tax Audit relates to a Straddle Period and any
Tax item cannot be identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot
be separated from a Tax item for which the other party is liable, DRI shall
be entitled to control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit if DRI so
notifies the Purchaser within fifteen (15) days of notice of such Tax Audit,
provided that DRI defends the Tax items as reported on the relevant
Tax Return in good faith as if DRI were the only Party with an interest in
the Tax item and provided further that DRI shall not settle such matter
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If DRI does not elect to
control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit, Purchaser shall control
the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit; _provided_ , that DRI shall pay
any Tax for which it is otherwise liable under this Article 9\. Any expenses
from such Straddle Period Tax Audit that relate to a Tax item for which only
one Party is liable shall be borne by such Party. Any other expenses from such
Straddle Period Tax Audit shall be borne by Purchaser and Sellers,
respectively, in the same proportion as such related Taxes are or would be
borne economically by Purchaser and Sellers.

(d) With respect to Pre-Closing Periods and Straddle Periods, any Party whose
liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in such defense and to employ counsel of its choice
at its expense and shall have the right to consent to any settlement of such
Tax Audit (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the
extent that such settlement would have an adverse effect with respect to a
period for which that party is liable for Taxes, under this Agreement or
otherwise.

Section 9.6 _Post-Closing Actions Which Affect Sellers  Tax Liability_.
Except to the extent required by applicable Laws, neither Purchaser nor the
Sellers shall and they 



 

76 _Execution Version_



 

 shall not permit their respective Affiliates, including the Companies and
Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries, to amend any Tax Return of the Companies or the
Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Section 9.6 shall limit the Sellers ability
to amend a Pre-Closing Period Tax Return that relates to federal income Taxes
or income Taxes for any state or local jurisdiction that conforms to the
federal income Tax with respect to the elections under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code contemplated by Section 9.9.

Section 9.7 _Refunds_.

(a) Purchaser agrees to pay to DRI any refund received (whether by payment,
credit, offset or otherwise, and together with any interest thereon) after the
Closing by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including the Companies and Wholly-
Owned Subsidiaries, reduced by any Taxes imposed thereon, in respect of any
Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period for which DRI is liable or required to
indemnify Purchaser under Section 9.1 (except for any refunds taken into
account pursuant to Section 2.3 or otherwise in connection with an adjustment
to the Purchase Price). Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to DRI
and DRIs Affiliates at DRIs expense in order to take all necessary steps to
claim any such refund. Any such refund received by Purchaser, its Affiliates,
a Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary shall be paid to DRI, reduced by any
Taxes imposed thereon, within thirty (30) days after such refund is received.
Purchaser agrees to notify DRI within ten (10) days following the
discovery of a right to claim any such refund and upon receipt of any such
refund. Purchaser agrees to claim any such refund as soon as possible after
the discovery of a right to claim a refund and to furnish to DRI all
information, records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the
refund or overpayment at DRIs expense. Purchaser shall be entitled to any
refund received (whether by payment, credit, offset or otherwise, and together
with any interest thereon) of, with respect to or relating to any of the
Companies or Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries or the Additional Assets, other than
those to which DRI is entitled pursuant to this Section 9.7(a).

(b) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Companies and any Wholly-Owned
Subsidiaries treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes not to,
carry back any Tax item of any Company or any such Wholly-Owned Subsidiary
arising in any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date to a taxable
year ending before the Closing Date.

Section 9.8 _Conflict and Additional Indemnity_.

(a) In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Article 9 and
any other provision of this Agreement, this Article 9 shall control.

(b) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Sellers and their current and former Affiliates (other than the
Companies and any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) and their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents from and against all Taxes and other costs
incurred or suffered by such Persons caused by or arising out of or resulting
from Purchasers breach of any of Purchasers covenants or agreements
contained in this Article 9 or in Section 2.2(c), 11.2(h), or 12.3, to the
extent such Taxes and other costs would not otherwise give rise to an
indemnification obligation of Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or
(c), even if such Taxes and other costs are caused in whole or in part by the
negligence (whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other
legal fault of any 



 

77 _Execution Version_



 

 of Sellers and their current and former Affiliates (other than the Companies
and any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary) and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents, but not such Persons willful misconduct or gross
negligence, but excepting in each case Taxes and other costs against which DRI
would be required to indemnify Purchaser under this Article 9 or Article 11 at
the time the claim notice is presented by Purchaser.

(c) From and after Closing, DRI shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser, its current and former Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents against and from all Taxes and other
costs incurred or suffered by such Persons caused by or arising out of or
resulting from Sellers breach of any of Sellers covenants or agreements
contained in this Article 9, or in Section 2.2(c), 6.5(g), 11.2(h), or 12.3,
to the extent such Taxes and other costs would not otherwise give rise to an
indemnification obligation of DRI pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or (b) even if
such Taxes and other costs are caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any of Purchaser, its current and former Affiliates and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents (but not such Persons
willful misconduct or gross negligence).

Section 9.9 _Election Under Code Section 338(h)(10)_. Sellers and Purchaser
agree that they shall make a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and under any comparable provisions of state or local law with respect
to the purchase of the Shares and with respect to Dominion Coalbed Methane,
Inc. Purchaser shall prepare copies of IRS Form 8023 and any similar state or
local forms, partially completed with the identity of the parties, and shall
deliver them to Sellers at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date
(provided that if Purchaser so chooses, such forms may be delivered after the
Closing Date). Sellers shall execute such forms on the Closing Date or, if
delivered after the Closing Date, within five (5) days of receipt and shall
deliver them to Purchaser. Purchaser shall file such forms with the applicable
Governmental Authorities. If any changes are required in these forms as a
result of information that is first available after such forms are completed,
the parties will promptly agree on such changes. Except to the extent required
by applicable Law, neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall take any action
inconsistent with, or fail to take any action necessary for, the validity of
the election described in this Section 9.9.

ARTICLE 10

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

Section 10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to Closing: (i) by the mutual prior written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;
or (ii) by either Sellers or Purchaser, by written notice to the other party,
if Closing has not occurred on or before June 10, 2010 (the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) if, as of the End Date all conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than
those that are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing) other than,
with respect to approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1(d) and 7.2(d), then both Parties may agree to extend the
End Date until the date that is ninety (90) days following the End Date by
providing written notice to the other party on or before the End Date and (B)
no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1(ii)

 because such Party negligently or willfully failed to perform or observe in
any material respect its covenants and agreements hereunder.

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or

to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or
covenants contained herein that are to be performed or observed at or prior to
Closing or (ii) Purchaser from liability (including liability for
consequential damages to the extent provided in Section 12.19) arising from a
Funding Failure. In the event this Agreement terminates under Section 10.1(ii)
and any Party has willfully or grossly negligently failed to perform or
observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained
herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing, then the
other Party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity
(including liability for consequential damages to the extent provided
in Section 12.19) and shall be entitled to recover court costs and attorneys
fees in addition to any other relief to which such Party may be entitled.

punitive damages awarded against Sellers or their Affiliates in any actions,
suits or proceedings with respect to the Additional Assets; or

of Purchasers covenants or agreements contained in Article 6; or

(v) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in Article 5 of this
Agreement or in the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
8.3(d);

even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence
(whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any Indemnified Person, but not such Indemnified Persons willful misconduct
or gross negligence, but excepting in each case Damages against which DRI
would be required to indemnify Purchaser under Section 11.2(b) at the time the
claim notice is presented by Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
above provisions of Section 11.2(a) shall not apply with respect to Damages
relating to Taxes.

(b) From and after Closing, DRI shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser, its current and former Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, employees and agents against and from all Damages
incurred or suffered by such Persons:

(i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from Sellers breach of any of
Sellers covenants or agreements contained in Article 6, Section 3.7(a) or
Section 3.7(d) ( _provided_ , _however_ , for purposes of interpretation of

"Material Adverse Effect," but not "material" or materiality generally, shall
be deemed to have been made without the "Material Adverse Effect"
qualification);

(ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by DRI contained in Article 4 of this
Agreement (other than a Specified Tax Representation), or in the certificates
delivered at Closing pursuant to Section 8.2(i) ( _provided_ , _however_ , for
purposes of interpretation of the preceding indemnity, Sellers
representations and warranties qualified by "Material Adverse Effect," but not
"material" or materiality generally shall be deemed to have been made without
the "Material Adverse Effect" qualification); or 

(iii) caused by, arising out of or resulting from the Retained Seller
Obligations;

even if such Damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether
sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other legal fault of
any Indemnified Person (but not such Indemnified Persons willful misconduct
or gross negligence).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
for the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 9.8(a) or Section
11.2(g), from and 



 

81 _Execution Version_



 

 after Closing, Sellers and Purchasers exclusive remedy against each other
with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained in Articles 4, 5 and 6 and the
affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to
Section 8.2(i) or Section 8.3(d), as applicable, is set forth in this Section
11.2. Except for the remedies contained in this Section 11.2 and Section 10.2,
and any other remedies available to the Parties at law or in equity for
breaches of provisions of this Agreement other than Articles 4, 5 and 6, and
for the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 9.8(a) or Section
11.2(g), Sellers and Purchaser each release, remise and forever discharge the
other and their or its Affiliates and all such Persons stockholders,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives from any
and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages,
losses, costs, liabilities, interest, or causes of action whatsoever, in law
or in equity, known or unknown, which such Parties might now or subsequently
may have, based on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any
Sellers, Companys or Wholly-Owned Subsidiarys ownership, use or operation
of the Assets, or the condition, quality, status or nature of the Assets,
including rights to cost recovery or contribution under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
breaches of statutory and implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions,
rights to punitive damages, common law rights of contribution, any rights
under insurance policies issued or underwritten by the other Party or Parties
or any of its or their Affiliates and any rights under agreements between the
Companies or the Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries and the Sellers or any other
Affiliate of the Companies, even if caused in whole or in part by the
negligence (whether sole, joint or concurrent), strict liability or other
legal fault of any released Person (but not such Indemnified Persons willful
misconduct or gross negligence), but excluding, however, any remaining balance
owed by DTI or any Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary to any other Affiliate
at the end of the Closing Date for provision of goods or services, or
employment-related costs, or other ordinary course of business expenses, with
respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets, the Companies or
any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary. Without limiting the generality of the preceding
sentence, and for the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 9.8(a)
or Section 11.2(g), Purchaser agrees that from and after Closing its only
remedy with respect to any Sellers breach of its covenants and agreements in
Article 6 shall be the indemnity of DRI in Section 11.2(b), as limited by the
terms of this Article 11\.

(d) " _Damages_ ," means the amount of any actual liability, loss, cost,
expense, claim, award or judgment incurred or suffered by any Indemnified
Person arising out of or resulting from the indemnified matter, whether
attributable to personal injury or death, property damage, contract claims,
torts or otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of
attorneys, consultants, accountants or other agents and experts reasonably
incident to matters indemnified against, and the costs of investigation and/or
monitoring of such matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that "Damages" shall not include any adjustment for
Taxes that may be assessed on payments under this Article 11 or for Tax
benefits received by the Indemnified Person as a consequence of any Damages.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and Sellers shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Section 11.2 for, and Damages shall not include,
(i) loss of profits, whether actual or consequential, or other consequential
damages suffered by the Party claiming indemnification, or any punitive
damages (other than loss of profits, consequential damages or punitive damages
suffered by third Persons for which responsibility is allocated between the
Parties), (ii) any liability, loss, cost, expense, 



 

82 _Execution Version_



 

 claim, award or judgment to the extent resulting from or increased by the
actions or omissions of any Indemnified Person after the Closing Date or (iii)
only in the case of claims under Section 11.2(a)(v) or Section 11.2(b)(ii),
any liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or judgment that does not
individually exceed One Million dollars ($1,000,000).

(e) Any claim for indemnity under this Section 11.2 by any current or former
Affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and
administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person
other than Sellers and Purchaser shall have any rights against either DRI or
Purchaser under the terms of this Section 11.2 except as may be exercised
on its behalf by Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, pursuant to this
Section 11.2(e). Each of the Sellers and Purchaser may elect to exercise or
not exercise indemnification rights under this Section 11.2(e) on behalf of
the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole discretion and
shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person for any action or
inaction under this Section 11.2(e).

(f) The conduct of any environmental investigation, material remediation or
other response action (and communication or negotiation with any Governmental
Authority regarding same) with respect to any claimed Damages under this
Section 11.2 or relating to a breach of DRIs representation or warranty
pursuant to Section 4.9 or any Claim relating to the subject matter of
such representation or warranty shall be subject to the following:

(i) Sellers and Purchaser agree that no environmental investigation, material
remediation or other response action with respect to any claimed Damages shall
be undertaken unless required by a Governmental Authority or as otherwise
agreed to by the Parties;

(ii) Sellers and Purchaser agree to take all reasonable actions to avoid and
minimize Damages that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under
this Section 11.2, including not undertaking, soliciting or importuning any
Governmental Authority to require any environmental action, investigation,
monitoring or remediation unless affirmatively required to do so
by Environmental Laws;

(iii) Purchaser shall not conduct (or have conducted on its behalf) any
environmental investigation, material remediation or other response action
without first giving Sellers notice of such action with reasonable detail at
least forty-five (45) days prior thereto (or such shorter period of time as
shall be required by any Governmental Authority). Sellers shall have the
option (in their sole discretion and at their sole expense) to conduct (or
have conducted on their behalf) such investigation, remediation, or response
operations. If Sellers shall not have notified Purchaser of their agreement
to conduct such operations within such specified period, then Purchaser may
conduct (or have conducted on its behalf at its sole expense) such operation.
All remediation activities conducted by Sellers under this Agreement shall be
conducted by qualified personnel or contractors in a professional and
workmanlike manner and, to the extent reasonably possible, so as not to
substantially interfere with Purchasers operation of the Assets. With respect
to any investigation, remediation or other response action subject to the
provisions of this Section 11.2(f), Sellers and Purchaser agree to provide
each other with copies of all reports submitted to the overseeing Governmental
Authority and all 



 

83 _Execution Version_



 

 results of sampling and analysis activities after such results are quality
assured/quality controlled;

(iv) Any remediation activities undertaken with respect to the Assets, whether
conducted by Purchaser or Sellers, for which DRI may have responsibility
shall be reasonable in extent and cost effective and shall be designed or
implemented in such a manner as to achieve the least stringent permanent risk-
based closure or remediation standard applicable to the property in question
under Environmental Laws, subject to the approval of any Governmental
Authority with jurisdiction over such remediation activities, and to the
extent either Party has legal capacity to do so Purchaser and Sellers agree to
impose reasonable environmental deed or use restrictions that reduce the cost
of any such remediation activities; and

(v) No Indemnifying Person shall have any obligation to indemnify any
Indemnified Person under this Section 11.2 for any Damages constituting costs
of any remedial, removal or other response action taken in order to meet a
more stringent cleanup standard (in comparison to the standard in effect as
of the Closing Date) triggered by a change by any Indemnified Person in land
use from such use in effect as of the Closing Date. For avoidance of doubt, in
connection with any remedial, removal or other response action required in
connection with any such change in use, the Indemnifying Person shall be
responsible for Damages to achieve the original standard in effect as of the
Closing Date and the Indemnified Person shall be responsible for all
incremental additional Damages, if any, necessary to achieve the more
stringent standard.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and for the
avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 9.8(a), the above provisions
of this Section 11.2 shall not apply in respect of title matters, such matters
being exclusively covered by Article 3 and the special warranty of title
provided by DTI in the Conveyances, or claims for Property Costs, such claims
being exclusively covered by Section 2.3, Section 2.4, Section 2.5 and Section
8.4.

(h) The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under this
Article 11 as an adjustment to the applicable Interest Purchase Price(s) in
the same manner as provided in Section 2.2.

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
Section 11.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 11, the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages means the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article 11, and the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when used
in connection with particular Damages means a Person having the right to be
indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article 11
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, those Persons identified in Section
11.2(e)).

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 11.2, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including the
specific details of and 



 

84 _Execution Version_



 

 specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ ").
In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a
third Person against the Indemnified Person (a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Person shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person
has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any
Indemnified Person to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section 11.3
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under Section
11.2 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being
available to permit the Indemnifying Person to effectively defend against the
Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Persons ability to defend
against the Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this
Article 11\. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person
within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Indemnifying Person
admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be
conclusively deemed obligated to provide such indemnification hereunder. The
Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day
period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying
Person and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim.
The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by
the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to
bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The
Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this
Section 11.3(d). An Indemnifying Person shall not, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final resolution
of the Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Claim (including, in
the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnified
Person from all further liability in respect of such Claim) or (ii) may
materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person (other than as a result
of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send 



 

85 _Execution Version_



 

 written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement and the
Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt
of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation for indemnification
with respect to such Claim and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, assume
the defense of the Claim, including the power to reject the proposed
settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Claim over the objection of
the Indemnifying Person after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its
obligation for indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the
Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right
to indemnity therefor.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder.

(g) The above provisions of this Section 11.3 shall not apply in respect of
Tax Audits.

Section 11.4 _Casualty and Condemnation_. If, after the Execution Date but
prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed or damaged
by fire or other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under
right of eminent domain, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to comply
with the covenants in Article 8 and attend the Closing. In the event that the
amount of the costs and expenses associated with repairing or restoring all
Assets affected by such casualty or the Allocated Value, determined in the
same manner as a Title Defect in accordance with Section 3.5(h), for all
Assets taken in a condemnation or pursuant to right of eminent domain exceeds
1.0% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price (disregarding the Individual Title
Threshold and Aggregate Title Deductible), Sellers must elect by written
notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected
by any casualty to be repaired or restored, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing
Date), (ii) to indemnify Purchaser through a document reasonably acceptable
to Sellers and Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser
reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets subject to any casualty or
(iii) to treat the costs and expenses associated with repairing or restoring
the Assets affected by such casualty or taking the Allocated Value for any
Wells or Marcellus Leases taken as a breach of DRIs representation under
Section 3.1 (disregarding the Individual Title Threshold and Aggregate Title
Deductible) In each case, Sellers shall retain (or, if applicable, receive an
assignment from the Company or Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, as applicable, owning
the affected properties of) all rights to insurance and other claims against
third Persons with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the
Parties otherwise agree in writing.

Section 11.5 _Limitation on Actions_.

(a) The representations and warranties of DRI and Purchaser in Articles 4 and
5 and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in Article 6 (excluding
Section 6.14), and the corresponding representations and warranties given in
the certificates delivered at Closing 



 

86 _Execution Version_



 

 pursuant to Section 8.2(i) or Section 8.3(d), as applicable, shall survive
the Closing until April 30, 2011 except that the representations and
warranties of DRI in Section 4.2(e) [Title to Shares] and Section 4.2(f) [The
Shares], the special warranty of title provided by DTI in the Conveyances
shall survive the Closing without time limit, the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Sellers in Section 2.2(c), Section 6.5(g),
Section 11.2(h), Section 12.3, Section 4.8 [Taxes and Assessments] and Article
9 shall survive Closing until thirty (30) days following the date on which
the applicable statute of limitations closes for the taxable year to which
the subject Taxes relate, and the representations and warranties of DEPI in
Section 4.17 [Operation of the EandP Business], and Section 4.21 [Absence of
Certain Changes] shall terminate at Closing.

The remainder of this Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit
except as may otherwise be expressly provided herein. Representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further force and effect
after the date of their expiration, _provided_ that there shall be no
termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its
expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in Section 11.2(a)(iv), Section 11.2(a)(v), Section
11.2(b)(i) and Section 11.2(b)(ii) shall terminate as of the termination date
of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is
subject to indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a
specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying
Person on or before such termination date. The indemnities in Section
11.2(a)(i), Section 11.2(a)(ii), Section 11.2(a)(iii), Section 11.2(b)(iii)
and Section 11.4 shall continue without time limit, except in so far as the
indemnities in Section 11.2(b)(iii) relate to Section 11.1(c), which
shall terminate on the Cut-Off Date (except as to matters for which a
specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying
Person on or before such termination date).

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section 9.8(a), DRI
shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
11.2(b)(ii) until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all
Damages for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds 1.0% of the
Unadjusted Purchase Price _,_ and then only to the extent such Damages
exceed 1.0% of the Unadjusted Purchase Price _._ This Section 11.5(c) shall
not limit indemnification for breach of those representations and warranties
that survive without time limit under the first sentence of Section 11.5(a),
nor shall it limit any indemnification provided under Section 2.5(b) or
Article 9, regardless whether such indemnification is also provided under
Section 11.2(b)(ii), nor shall Damages for those matters count toward the
threshold in the first sentence of this Section 11.5(c).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, except as provided in Section
9.8(a), DRI shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under Section
11.2(b)(ii) for aggregate Damages in excess of 10% of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 11.5(d) shall not limit
DRIs liability with respect to breaches of those representations and
warranties that survive without time limit under the first sentence of Section
11.5(a), nor shall it limit any indemnification provided under Section 2.5(b)
or Article 9, regardless whether such indemnification is also provided under
Section 11.2(b)(ii).



 

87 _Execution Version_



 

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates).

Section 12.3 _Sales or Use Tax, Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and Fees_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 9, Purchaser shall bear
the first One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000), and thereafter DRI and
Purchaser shall each bear fifty percent (50%), of any sales, use, excise, real
property transfer, registration, documentary, stamp or transfer Taxes,
recording fees and similar Taxes and fees incurred and imposed upon, or with
respect to, the property transfers to Purchaser contemplated hereby ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "). Should any Seller, Company or Affiliate of any of them
pay prior to Closing, or should Seller or any continuing Affiliate of Seller
pay after Closing, any amount for which Purchaser is liable under this Section
12.3, Purchaser shall, promptly following receipt of Sellers
invoice, reimburse the amount paid, or if Purchaser has satisfied its
obligation to pay the first One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000) of such
amounts, fifty percent (50%) of the amount paid. Should Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates pay prior to Closing, or should Purchaser, any Company or
Affiliate of any of them pay after Closing, any amount for which DRI is liable
under this Section 12.3, DRI shall, promptly following receipt of Purchasers
invoice, reimburse fifty percent (50%) of the amount paid. If such transfers
or transactions are exempt from any such taxes or fees upon the filing of an
appropriate certificate or other evidence of exemption, Purchaser shall timely
furnish to Sellers such certificate or evidence. Sellers shall provide
reasonable assistance to Purchaser in establishing the applicability of any
exemption from sales, use, real property transfer or any other Transfer Taxes
that is based wholly or partially on facts and information related to
Sellers, including, providing Purchaser and taxing authorities access to books
and records establishing the lack of prior similar sales activity and the
ability of a particular Seller to separately establish income and
expenses attributable to assets being transferred to Purchaser.



 

89 _Execution Version_



 

Section 12.4 _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 6.7 and in Section
12.3, all expenses incurred by Sellers (or by any Company or Wholly-Owned
Subsidiary) in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation or
execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and
thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing, including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants and financial advisers employed by Sellers,
shall be borne solely and entirely by Sellers, and all such expenses incurred
by Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely by Purchaser.

Section 12.5 _Records_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, each Party shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the other Party hereto any Records that
are in the possession of such Party and included in the Assets or Excluded
Assets, as applicable, subject to Section 12.5(b).

(b) Sellers may retain the originals of those Records relating to Tax and
accounting matters and provide Purchaser with copies of such Records that
pertain to (i) non-income Tax matters solely related to the Companies or the
Additional Assets; or (ii) non-unitary state income Tax Returns to the extent
such Tax Returns are reasonably necessary to satisfy Purchasers Tax Return
filing obligations under Section 9.2. Sellers may retain copies of any other
Records.

(c) Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing,
(and subject to Purchasers additional obligations under Section 9.4) shall:

(i) retain the Records; 

(ii) provide Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective officers,
employees and representatives with access to the Records during normal
business hours for review and copying at Sellers expense; and

(iii) provide Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective officers,
employees and representatives with access, during normal business hours, to
materials received or produced after Closing relating to:

(A) Sellers obligations under Article 9 (including to prepare Tax Returns and
to conduct negotiations with Tax Authorities); or

(B) any claim for indemnification made under Section 11.2 of this Agreement
(excluding, however, attorney work product and attorney-client communications
with respect to any such claim being brought by Purchaser under this
Agreement);

for review and copying at Sellers expense and to the Companies and their
Affiliates personnel for the purpose of discussing any such matter or claim.

Section 12.6 _Name Change_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make the
filings required in each Companys and Wholly-Owned Subsidiarys jurisdiction
of organization 



 

90 _Execution Version_



 

 to eliminate the name "Dominion" and any variants thereof from the name of
each Company and Wholly-Owned Subsidiary. As promptly as practicable, but in
any case within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall (i) make all other filings (including assumed name filings)
required to reflect the change of name in all applicable records of
Governmental Authorities and (ii) eliminate the use of the name "Dominion"
and variants thereof from the Assets and the EandP Business, and, except with
respect to such grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no
right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to any Seller or
any of its Affiliates. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any direct or
indirect costs or expenses resulting from the change in use of name, and any
resulting notification or approval requirements.

Section 12.7 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THAT
WOULD DIRECT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.

Section 12.8 _Dispute Resolution_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that each of the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively
in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom
within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware). Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in
any action brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if jurisdiction is
not available in the Delaware Court of Chancery, to personal jurisdiction in
any action brought in the state or federal courts located in the State of
Delaware) with respect to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, and each of the Parties
hereto agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with respect
to any such dispute, controversy or claim (except to the extent a dispute,
controversy, or claim arising out of or in relation to or in connection
with the allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or the
determination of a Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount pursuant to
Section 3.5(j) is referred to an expert pursuant to those Sections) will be
instituted exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if jurisdiction
is not available in the Delaware Court of Chancery, then exclusively in the
state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the entities that have committed to provide or otherwise
entered into agreements in connection with the Financing or other financings
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the parties
to the Commitment Letter and the parties to the definitive documentation
respecting the Financing (including any joinder agreements or credit
agreements) (collectively the " _Financing Parties_ ") in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Commitment Letter or the definitive documentation respecting the
Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the federal and
New York State courts located in the City of New York, Borough of 



 

91 _Execution Version_



 

 Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof). The Financing Parties shall be
express third party beneficiaries of this Section 12.8. The Parties hereby
waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by any
Party against another in any matter whatsoever arising out of or in relation
to or in connection with this Agreement.

Section 12.9 _Captions_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience
only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or
interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 12.10 _Waivers_. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived by the
Party to whom such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to
whom compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any
other manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent
to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall

 AFTER THE SATISFACTION OF THE CONDITIONS IN SECTION 7.1 OR 7.2,
RESPECTIVELY, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE
ONE PARTY TO MAKE CLAIMS, INCLUDE IN CALCULATION, SUE FOR OR COLLECT FROM THE
OTHER PARTY ITS OWN PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ITS OWN CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR
INDIRECT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND, EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS RELATED TO A FUNDING FAILURE OR

time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in this
Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or
if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action

period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be
the next day which is a Business Day.
