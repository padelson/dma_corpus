<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;2.1 <U>Purchase Price and Non-Compete Consideration</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Amount of Purchase Price and Non-Compete Consideration</U>. The purchase price for
the Share Interests shall be $169,000,000 in cash, as adjusted pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(a) (the
&#147;<U>Initial Purchase Price</U>&#148;) and as adjusted pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(b) hereof (as adjusted,
the &#147;<U>Purchase Price</U>&#148;). In addition, the consideration for Seller&#146;s Restrictive Covenants

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Adjustment Methodology</U>. The following principles shall apply to the calculation
of purchase price adjustments hereunder, including the estimates set forth above:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(i)&nbsp;Unless otherwise specified, all such calculations required to be made as of the Closing
Date shall be calculated as of the opening of business (New York City time) on the Closing Date,
without giving effect to any of the Transactions;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(ii)&nbsp;All such calculations shall be made in U.S. dollars and utilizing the same principles,
policies, methodologies and procedures adopted in the preparation of the Interim Balance Sheet,
except for the modifications set forth in <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.2</U>; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(iii)&nbsp;The calculations shall be made in a manner consistent with the methodologies set forth
on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.2</U>.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; font-size: 12pt">(b) <U>Final Adjustment Procedures</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(i)&nbsp;Within 90&nbsp;days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement (the &#147;<U>Adjustment Statement</U>&#148;) calculating the actual amount of Net Working Capital
as of the opening of business (New York City time) on the Closing Date (the &#147;<U>Closing Net
Working Capital</U>&#148;), prepared in accordance with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.2 (including
<U>Schedule&nbsp;2.2</U>) and signed by a senior officer of Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(ii)&nbsp;After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Seller shall have 45&nbsp;days to review it.
Seller and its independent accountants and financial advisors shall have reasonable access during
normal business hours to the working papers and accounting and other financial records of the
Companies and the appropriate personnel of the Companies to the extent required to review and
evaluate the Adjustment Statement. On or prior to the 45<sup>th</sup> day after receipt of the
Adjustment Statement, Seller shall deliver notice in writing to Buyer specifying in detail any
disputed items and the basis therefor. If Seller fails to notify Buyer of any such disputes on or
prior to the 45<sup>th</sup> day after receipt of the Adjustment Statement, then the calculations
set forth on the Adjustment Statement shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall be final,
binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement. If Seller so notifies
Buyer in writing of any disputed items on the Adjustment Statement, (A)&nbsp;any items which are not
disputed shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall be final, binding, conclusive and
nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement and (B)&nbsp;Seller and Buyer shall, over the 45&nbsp;days
following the date of such notice (the &#147;<U>Resolution Period</U>&#148;), attempt to resolve any
disputed items, and any written resolution by them as to any such disputed amount shall be final,
binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(iii)&nbsp;If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Seller and Buyer have not reached an
agreement on the disputed items, then all amounts and issues remaining in dispute shall be
submitted by Seller and Buyer to the New York office of Deloitte &#038; Touche LLP, or another mutually
acceptable and nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the &#147;<U>Neutral Auditor</U>&#148;).
All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be
borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. Any additional rules of engagement or procedures shall be as
set forth in an engagement letter between the Neutral Auditor and each of Buyer and Seller. Except
as provided in the second preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the parties
in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Neutral Auditor shall be borne by the
party incurring such cost and expense. The Neutral Auditor shall determine only those issues still
in dispute at the end of the Resolution Period. In no event shall the Neutral Auditor&#146;s
determination be outside of the range of amounts claimed by the respective parties with respect to
those issues in dispute. The Neutral Auditor&#146;s determination shall be made within 45&nbsp;days after
its engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than five Business Days after the end of
the Resolution Period), or as soon thereafter as possible, and shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable
for all purposes hereunder. The term &#147;<U>Final Adjustment Statement</U>&#148; means the definitive
Adjustment Statement agreed to by Seller and Buyer in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2(b)(ii) or the
definitive Adjustment Statement resulting from the determination made by the Neutral Auditor in
accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.2(b)(iii).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(iv)&nbsp;In the event (A)&nbsp;the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Final Adjustment
Statement is greater than the Working Capital Target Amount, Parent shall cause Buyer to pay, and
Buyer shall pay, the lesser of the amount of such excess and $1,000,000 to Seller or (B)&nbsp;the
Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Final Adjustment Statement is less than the Working
Capital Target Amount, Seller shall pay the lesser of the amount of such deficiency and $1,000,000
to Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(v)&nbsp;Any payment required pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.2(b) (the &#147;<U>Final Adjustment
Amount</U>&#148;) shall be made in U.S. dollars 5&nbsp;days after finalization of the Final Adjustment
Statement. Payments due shall be paid to the applicable party together with interest at the
Interest Rate from and including the Closing Date to and excluding the date of payment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(i)&nbsp;Seller shall be responsible for the payment of the following liabilities (the

2.2(c)(i)(A) and Section&nbsp;2.2(c)(i)(D), respectively. Any disputes with respect to the bonus or
customer discount calculations shall be resolved in a manner consistent with the Neutral Auditor

Liabilities.

III (except for those in Section&nbsp;3.5(b)) shall not be deemed breached, untrue or incorrect as a
result of the failure to disclose or make exceptions for matters concerning BWL Asia and its
Subsidiaries. Subject to the foregoing, Seller represents and warrants to Parent and Buyer that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.1 <U>Due Organization</U>. Except as set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.1</U>, each of
Seller and the Companies is duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the state of its incorporation. Except as set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.1</U>, each of the Companies
has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate the properties used in
the Business and to carry on the Business as presently conducted. Except as set forth on
<U>Schedule&nbsp;3.1</U>, each of the Companies is duly authorized, qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation and in good standing in every jurisdiction wherein, by reason of
the nature of the Business, the failure to be so qualified would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.2 <U>Authorization and Validity of Agreement</U>. This Agreement and the
consummation by Seller of all of the Transactions have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Seller and by all other requisite corporate, shareholder or other action of Seller,
and Seller has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller,
and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of Seller, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be (a)&nbsp;limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146; rights, or (b)&nbsp;subject to general principles of
equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.3 <U>Non-Contravention</U>. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller

provision of the certificate of incorporation of Seller or any Company and (b)&nbsp;assuming that all
Consents set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.3</U> and <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.4</U> have been obtained or made,
will not (i)&nbsp;violate any Law or Order to which Seller or any Company is subject or (ii)&nbsp;result in
any breach or creation of any Lien or constitute any default under, or give any third Person any
right to terminate, any contract, indenture, mortgage, lease, note or other agreement or instrument
to which Seller or any Company is subject or is a party, except, in the case of clause (b), for any
such breach, default or creation of any Lien or termination right which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;3.4 <U>Governmental Approvals; Consents</U>. No claim, legal action, suit,
arbitration, governmental investigation, or other legal, judicial or administrative proceeding
(&#147;<U>Action</U>&#148;) is pending or, to Seller&#146;s Knowledge, threatened against Seller or any Company
which would prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions. Except as set forth in
<U>Schedule&nbsp;3.4</U> and except for the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (the &#147;<U>Hart-Scott Act</U>&#148;), no Consent of any Governmental Entity is
or has been required on the part of Seller or the Companies in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

Share Interests to Buyer at the Closing and upon Seller&#146;s receipt of the Initial Purchase Price,
good and valid title to the Share Interests shall pass to Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, other
than those created by Parent or Buyer. There are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights
of any kind relating to the sale, issuance or voting of any Share Interests or any securities
convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any Share Interests.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Except as indicated on <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.5</U>, BBS has no Subsidiaries and owns or holds of
record and/or beneficially no shares of any class of capital stock of or any ownership interests in

BBS owns all of the outstanding share capital or equivalent ownership interests of each of the
other Companies (including BWL Asia), free and clear of all Liens, other than those that will be
released on or prior to the Closing Date or those created by Parent or Buyer.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Schedule&nbsp;3.6(a)</U> contains a copy of the unaudited pro forma balance sheet of the
Business as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and the related pro forma statement of results of operations for

Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and the
results of the operations of the Business as of the date and for the period indicated.
<U>Schedule&nbsp;3.6(a)</U> also contains the unaudited pro forma balance sheet of Business as of June

the &#147;<U>Interim Financial Statements</U>&#148; and together with the Annual Financial Statements, the

respects, the financial condition of Business as of such date and the results of operations for the
six-month period then ended, subject to normal year-end adjustments. The Annual Financial
Statements and the Interim Financial Statements have been prepared consistently with U.S. GAAP and
consistently with BBS&#146; internal accounting practices for equivalent prior accounting periods,
except as may be disclosed therein and except for the absence of footnote disclosures and cash flow
statements and, in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end
adjustments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Except as set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;3.6(b)</U>, BBS and its Subsidiaries had no liability
or obligation (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which is not fully reflected or
reserved against in the Interim Balance Sheet, which, in accordance with GAAP, is a liability that
should be reflected on a balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto, other than (i)&nbsp;liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since June&nbsp;30, 2004, (ii)&nbsp;liabilities and
obligations otherwise disclosed in this Agreement or the Schedules hereto, and (iii)&nbsp;liabilities

rights, or (b)&nbsp;subject to general principles of equity. The Board of Directors of Parent has
recommended that its stockholders approve the financing required to consummate the Transactions and
the amendment to Parent&#146;s articles of association therefor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.3 <U>Non-Contravention</U>. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each
of Parent and Buyer and the consummation by Parent and Buyer of the Transactions will not (a)
violate or conflict with any provision of the memorandum and articles of association of Parent or
of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Buyer and (b)&nbsp;assuming that all Consents set
forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.2</U> or <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.3</U> hereto have been obtained or made, will not
(i)&nbsp;violate any Law or Order to which Parent or Buyer is subject or (ii)&nbsp;result in any breach or
creation of any Lien or constitute any default under any contract, indenture, mortgage, lease, note
or other agreement or instrument to which Parent or Buyer is subject or is a party, except, in the
case of clause (b), for any such breach, default or creation of any Lien which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.4 <U>Governmental Approvals; Consents</U>. Neither Parent nor Buyer is subject to
any Order which would prevent the consummation of the Transactions. No Action is pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent or Buyer, threatened against Parent or Buyer which would prevent or delay
the Transactions. Except as set forth in <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.4</U> hereto and except for the
requirements of the Hart-Scott Act, no Consent of any Governmental Entity is or has been required
on the part of Parent or Buyer in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.5 <U>Litigation</U>. There are no (a)&nbsp;Orders against Buyer or its Affiliates or
(b)&nbsp;Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Buyer, threatened in law or in equity, or
before any Governmental Entity, against Buyer or its Affiliates (i)&nbsp;challenging or seeking to
restrain, delay or prohibit any of the Transactions or (ii)&nbsp;preventing Parent or Buyer from
performing in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement or consummating the
Transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.6 <U>Independent Decision</U>. Parent and Buyer (a)&nbsp;are represented by competent
legal counsel, (b)&nbsp;have knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, including
specifically integrated information management service businesses, (c)&nbsp;have the capability of
evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the Share Interests, and (d)&nbsp;are not in a disparate
bargaining position with Seller. Parent and Buyer acknowledge that they and their representatives
have been permitted such access to the books and records, facilities, equipment, tax returns,
contracts, insurance policies (or summaries thereof) and other properties and assets of the
Companies that they and their representatives have desired or requested to see or review, and that
they and their representatives have had such opportunity to meet with the officers and employees of
Seller and the Companies to discuss the businesses and assets of the Companies as Parent and Buyer
deemed necessary. None of Seller, the Companies, their representatives or any other Person shall
have or be subject to any liability (other than for fraud) to Buyer or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Parent or Buyer, or Parent&#146;s or Buyer&#146;s use, of any such information with
respect to the Business and any information, documents or materials made available to Parent and
Buyer in management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the Transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.7 <U>Purchase for Investment</U>. Parent and Buyer are aware that the Share
Interests are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#147;<U>Securities Act</U>&#148;), or under any state or foreign
securities laws. Neither Parent nor Buyer is an underwriter, as such term is defined under the
Securities Act, and is purchasing such interests solely for investment, with no present intention
to distribute any such interests to any Person, and neither Parent nor Buyer will sell or otherwise
dispose of the Share Interests except in compliance with the registration requirements or exemption
provisions under the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.8 <U>Financial Capacity; No Financing Condition</U>. Parent and Buyer have
available to them committed bank financing and other funds sufficient to consummate the
Transactions (including the payment of all related fees and expenses incurred by them). Parent and
Buyer understand that their obligations to effect the Transactions are not subject to the
availability to Parent and Buyer of financing. Parent has provided Seller with a true and complete
copy of a senior credit agreement and mezzanine facility agreement with The Royal Bank of Scotland
plc (the &#147;<U>Financing Commitments</U>&#148;). None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or
modified in any material respect (individually or in the aggregate), and the respective commitments
contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect. There is no condition precedent or other
contingency related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in
or contemplated by the Financing Commitments. The parties to the Financing Commitments are in the
&#147;Availability Period&#148; with respect to each &#147;Acquisition Facility&#148; as contemplated therein, which
period expires the earlier of the Closing Date and December&nbsp;31, 2004. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor Buyer has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments within the control of Parent and Buyer will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be made available to Buyer on the Closing Date. Parent
(or one or more of its officers on behalf of Parent) has received valid and enforceable (under U.K.
law or any other applicable Law) irrevocable voting undertakings (the &#147;<U>Voting
Undertakings</U>&#148;) from holders of Parent shares that represent Parent&#146;s power to vote more than
75% of the outstanding votes of Parent&#146;s capital stock in favor of the matters described on
<U>Schedule&nbsp;4.2</U>, and such Voting Undertakings represent a number of shares necessary to
approve the matters described in on <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.2</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.9 <U>Finders; Brokers</U>. Except as set forth in <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.9</U>, neither
Parent nor Buyer is a party to any agreement with any finder or broker, or in any way obligated to
any finder or broker for any commissions, fees or expenses, in connection with the execution of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;4.10 <U>No Other Representations or Warranties</U>. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Article&nbsp;IV, neither Parent or Buyer nor any other Person makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of Parent or Buyer.

imposed in connection with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be determined by assuming that
the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the
Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and
items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the
Companies for the Straddle Period will be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a
&#147;closing of the books basis&#148; (in accordance with GAAP) by assuming that the books of the Companies

the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period. For purposes of clause (i)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction,
credit or other item (including the effect of any graduated rates of tax) that is calculated on an

Period times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with past practice of the Companies.

Governmental Entity to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short taxable period ending as
of the close of business on the Closing Date.

Parent or Buyer that any breach of any of the Restrictive Covenants will cause irreparable injury
to Parent or Buyer, nor will the Seller assert as a defense to any such attempt to obtain equitable
relief that money damages will provide an adequate remedy to Parent and Buyer. Under no
circumstances shall Parent or Buyer be required to post a bond to enforce this covenant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(e)&nbsp;It is the desire and intent of the parties that the Restrictive Covenants will be enforced
to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction
in which enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any Restrictive Covenant shall be adjudicated to
be invalid or unenforceable, such Restrictive Covenant shall be deemed amended to the extent
necessary in order that such provision be valid and enforceable, such amendment to apply only with
respect to the operation of such Restrictive Covenant in the particular jurisdiction in which such
adjudication is made. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Restrictive Covenants are
reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects. If any court

&#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) shall provide the indemnifying party/ies (the &#147;<U>Indemnifying
Party</U>&#148;) prompt written notice of any third party claim which may give rise to any indemnity
obligation under this Article&nbsp;VIII, together with the estimated amount of such claim, if reasonably
available, copies of all correspondence, process, legal pleadings and other relevant documentation
relating thereto, and reference to the provisions of this Agreement under which liability is
asserted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any such claim
through counsel of its own choosing, by so notifying the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)&nbsp;days
of receipt of the Indemnified Party&#146;s written notice. Failure to give prompt notice shall not
affect the indemnification obligations hereunder in the absence of actual prejudice. If the
Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense validly assumed by the Indemnifying
Party, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to
assume any such defense, it shall be liable for all costs and expenses of defending such claim
incurred by the Indemnified Party, including all reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be

affects Parent, Buyer or the Companies, (ii)&nbsp;on a basis which would restrict the future activity or
conduct of, or involve the admission of wrongdoing by, the Companies or any Affiliate thereof or
(iii)&nbsp;if such settlement or compromise does not include an unconditional release of Buyer and its
Affiliates for any liability arising out of such claim or demand from the applicable third party.
Except as contemplated by Section&nbsp;8.6(b), neither Parent nor Buyer shall, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle, compromise or offer

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Seller&#146;s liability for any Losses arising from any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement shall be subject to the following limitations:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(i)&nbsp;Seller&#146;s representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing, but
shall terminate on April&nbsp;30, 2006 except to the extent that written notice of any alleged breach
thereof has been provided to Seller prior to such date pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.3; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 15%">(ii)&nbsp;Seller shall have no liability for such Losses until the aggregate amount of such Losses
for which Seller is obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1(a) shall exceed $1,000,000 (the
&#147;<U>Threshold Amount</U>&#148;), in which case Seller shall only be liable to the extent that the
aggregate of all such indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Threshold Amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Seller&#146;s aggregate liability for all indemnified Losses under Sections&nbsp;8.1(a) and 8.1(b)
of this Agreement shall not exceed 75% of the sum of the Purchase Price and the Non-Compete
Consideration, except that Seller&#146;s aggregate liability for all indemnified Losses pursuant to
Section&nbsp;8.1 shall not exceed 100% of such sum. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
limitations of this clause (b)&nbsp;shall not apply to (i)&nbsp;any Taxes of Seller and its Subsidiaries
other than Taxes of, or attributable to, the Companies and (ii)&nbsp;Section&nbsp;8.1(d).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;The amount of the Indemnifying Party&#146;s liability under this Agreement for any Loss shall
be determined after taking into account any applicable insurance proceeds received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss. Buyer and Seller shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect any amount available under insurance coverage or from any other Person
responsible for any Losses for which an indemnity claim is being made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;No Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Agreement to multiple recovery for the
same Losses, and the parties agree that the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement
shall not apply to any Losses to the extent such Losses are accounted for in the calculations of
the purchase price adjustment set forth in Section&nbsp;2.2. Seller shall cooperate with and assist
Buyer and the Companies to recover any reasonable claims resulting from pre-Closing events or
occurrences with respect to the operations of the Companies under any insurance policy of Seller
applicable therefor; <U>provided</U> that Seller shall have no obligation to incur any cost or
expense, pay any premium or make any other payment to an insurer in connection therewith unless
reimbursed by Buyer therefor. If an Indemnified Party receives any amount under applicable
insurance policy, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to
receipt of an indemnification payment, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the amount received by the
Indemnified Party from the other Person in respect of such Losses, net of any expenses incurred by
such party in collecting such amount, and (ii)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of the total amount received in
respect of such Losses from the other Person and from the Indemnifying Party over the sum of the
total amount of such Losses suffered by the Indemnified Party and the expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in collecting such amounts. Any Losses excluded from the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article&nbsp;VIII due to insurance or other third party recoveries shall
not be considered for purposes of calculating the deductible threshold set forth in Section&nbsp;8.4(a).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;All indemnification payments for Losses made pursuant to this Article&nbsp;VIII shall be made
on an after-tax basis. Accordingly, in determining the amount of any indemnification payment for a
Loss suffered or incurred by an indemnitee hereunder, the amount of such Loss shall be (i)
increased to take into account any additional Tax cost actually incurred by the indemnitee arising
from the receipt of indemnification payments hereunder (&#147;<U>Tax Costs</U>&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;decreased to
take into account any deduction, credit or other tax benefit actually realized by the indemnitee
with respect to such Loss (&#147;<U>Tax Benefits</U>&#148;). In computing the amount of any such Tax Cost
or Tax Benefit, the indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnification
payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss; <U>provided</U>, that, if
a Tax Cost or Tax Benefit is not realized in the taxable period during which an indemnifying party
makes an indemnification payment or the indemnitee incurs or pays any Loss, the parties hereto
shall thereafter make payments to one another at the end of each subsequent taxable period to
reflect the net Tax Costs and Tax Benefits realized by the parties hereto in each such subsequent
taxable period. Any payment made from Seller to Buyer shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be
treated as a reduction in Purchase Price that will not result in any actual Tax Cost to Buyer for
purposes of subsection (i)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;8.4(e).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;The parties agree that under no circumstances will a party be entitled to any special,
consequential, indirect or punitive damages pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Agreement, except to the extent such damages are awarded or otherwise required to be paid to a
third party. The foregoing shall not, however, limit the ability of the Parent and the Buyer to
recover Damages for the diminution in value of the Companies associated with any breach of the
Seller&#146;s representations and warranties relating to the Companies hereunder to the extent that the
laws of New York would permit a party to recover such damages as a consequence of the breach.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(g)&nbsp;Without prejudice to Section&nbsp;9.7, in the absence of fraud, the indemnification provided in
this Article&nbsp;VIII shall be the exclusive remedy for money damages available to the parties for any
breach of this Agreement or in relation to any claim arising out of the Transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(h)&nbsp;The parties agree that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;After the Closing, each party to this Agreement (whether Parent/Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be) shall promptly notify the other party in writing of any demand, claim or notice of the
commencement of an audit received by such party from any Governmental Entity or any other Person
with respect to Taxes for which such other party is liable pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1(c) or 8.2(e) of
this Agreement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that a failure to give such notice will not
affect such party&#146;s rights to indemnification under this Article&nbsp;VIII, except to the extent that
such other party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to
the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the relevant
portion of any notice or other document received from any Governmental Entity or any other Person
in respect of any such asserted Tax liability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Payment by an Indemnifying Party of any amount due to an Indemnified Party under Section
8.1(c) or 8.2(e) of this Agreement shall be made within ten (10)&nbsp;days following written notice by
the indemnitee that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity or other
applicable third party is due by the indemnitee, <U>provided</U> that the indemnitor shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than five (5)&nbsp;business days before it is due to the
appropriate Governmental Entity or applicable third party. In the case of a Tax that is contested
in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;8.6 of this Agreement, payment of such contested Tax
will not be considered due earlier than the date a &#147;final determination&#148; to such effect is made by
such Governmental Entity. For this purpose, a &#147;final determination&#148; shall mean a settlement,
compromise, or other agreement with the relevant Governmental Entity, whether contained in an
Internal Revenue Service Form&nbsp;870 or other comparable form, or otherwise, or such procedurally
later event, such as a closing agreement with the relevant Governmental Entity, an agreement
contained in Internal Revenue Service form 870-D or other comparable form, an agreement that
constitutes a &#147;determination&#148; under Section&nbsp;1313(a)(4) of the Code, a deficiency notice with
respect to which the period for filing a petition with the Tax Court or the relevant state, local
or foreign tribunal has expired or a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction that is not
subject to appeal or as to which the time for appeal has expired.

Seller shall control the conduct of such Contest, but Buyer shall have the right to participate in
such Contest (or, in the case of a Contest that relates to a consolidated group Tax Return of
Seller, in any portion of such Contest that relates to any of the Companies) at its own expense,
and Seller shall not be able to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that
is reasonably likely to affect the Tax liability of any of the Companies for any taxable year (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; <U>provided</U> that with respect to any such Contest
other than a Contest that relates solely to a consolidated Tax Return of the Seller Group, if
Seller fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Contest within a reasonable period
following the receipt by Seller of notice of such Contest, Buyer shall have the right to assume
control of such Contest and Buyer shall be able to settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest
in its sole discretion, unless such Contest involves a matter indemnifiable by Seller, in which
case Buyer shall not settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest without prior written consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that if Seller does not provide
Buyer with such written consent within 30&nbsp;days after Buyer notifies Seller of such proposed
settlement, compromise and/or concession, Buyer shall be able to settle, compromise and/or concede
such Contest without such consent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;In the case of a Contest that relates to a Straddle Return, Seller shall control the

written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Section&nbsp;9.3 <U>Non-Assignability</U>. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding on the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This

any Action in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set

any court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, all other provisions of
