ARTICLE II    

 _PURCHASE PRICE; CLOSING_      

Section 2.1 _Purchase Price and Non-Compete Consideration_.   

(a) _Amount of Purchase Price and Non-Compete Consideration_. The purchase
price for the Share Interests shall be $169,000,000 in cash, as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) (the " _Initial Purchase Price_ ") and as adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.2(b) hereof (as adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ "). In
addition, the consideration for Sellers Restrictive Covenants in Section
5.17 (the " _Non-Compete Consideration_ ") shall be $11,000,000 in cash.   

(b) _Payment of Initial Purchase Price and Non-Compete Consideration_. On the
Closing Date, Parent shall cause Buyer to pay, and Buyer shall pay, the
Initial Purchase Price and Non-Compete Consideration in immediately available
federal funds to such bank accounts, in the United States, as shall be
designated by Seller in writing at least two Business Days prior
to Closing.    

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price Adjustment_    

(a) _Adjustment Methodology_. The following principles shall apply to the
calculation of purchase price adjustments hereunder, including the estimates
set forth above:   

(i) Unless otherwise specified, all such calculations required to be made as
of the Closing Date shall be calculated as of the opening of business (New
York City time) on the Closing Date, without giving effect to any of the
Transactions;   

(ii) All such calculations shall be made in U.S. dollars and utilizing the
same principles, policies, methodologies and procedures adopted in the
preparation of the Interim Balance Sheet, except for the modifications set
forth in _Schedule 2.2_; and   

(iii) The calculations shall be made in a manner consistent with the
methodologies set forth on _Schedule 2.2_.    

(b) _Final Adjustment Procedures_.   

(i) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Seller a statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") calculating the actual
amount of Net Working Capital as of the opening of business (New York City
time) on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), prepared
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2 (including  _Schedule
2.2_) and signed by a senior officer of Buyer.   

(ii) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Seller shall have 45 days to
review it. Seller and its independent accountants and financial advisors
shall have reasonable access during normal business hours to the working
papers and accounting and other financial records of the Companies and the
appropriate personnel of the Companies to the extent required to review
and evaluate the Adjustment Statement. On or prior to the 45th day after
receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Seller shall deliver notice in writing
to Buyer specifying in detail any disputed items and the basis therefor. If
Seller fails to notify Buyer of any such disputes on or prior to the 45th day
after receipt of the Adjustment Statement, then the calculations set forth on
the Adjustment Statement shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall be
final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes of this
Agreement. If Seller so notifies Buyer in writing of any disputed items on
the Adjustment Statement, (A) any items which are not disputed shall be
deemed accepted by Seller and shall be final, binding, conclusive
and nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement and (B) Seller and Buyer
shall, over the 45 days following the date of such notice (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), attempt to resolve any disputed items, and any written resolution
by them as to any such disputed amount shall be final, binding, conclusive
and nonappealable for all purposes under this Agreement.   

(iii) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, Seller and Buyer have not
reached an agreement on the disputed items, then all amounts and issues
remaining in dispute shall be submitted by Seller and Buyer to the New York
office of Deloitte and Touche LLP, or another mutually acceptable and
nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the " _Neutral Auditor_
"). All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Neutral Auditor shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer. Any
additional rules of engagement or procedures shall be as set forth in an
engagement letter between the Neutral Auditor and each of Buyer and Seller.
Except as provided in the second preceding sentence, all other costs and
expenses incurred by the parties in connection with resolving any dispute
hereunder before the Neutral Auditor shall be borne by the party incurring
such cost and expense. The Neutral Auditor shall determine only those issues
still in dispute at the end of the Resolution Period. In no event shall the
Neutral Auditors determination be outside of the range of amounts claimed by
the respective parties with respect to those issues in dispute. The Neutral
Auditors determination shall be made within 45 days after its engagement
(which engagement shall be made no later than five Business Days after the end
of the Resolution Period), or as soon thereafter as possible, and shall be
set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be
final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes hereunder. The
term " _Final Adjustment Statement_ " means the definitive Adjustment
Statement agreed to by Seller and Buyer in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(ii)
or the definitive Adjustment Statement resulting from the determination made
by the Neutral Auditor in accordance with this Section 2.2(b)(iii).   

(iv) In the event (A) the Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Final
Adjustment Statement is greater than the Working Capital Target Amount,
Parent shall cause Buyer to pay, and Buyer shall pay, the lesser of the
amount of such excess and $1,000,000 to Seller or (B) the Closing Net Working
Capital set forth in the Final Adjustment Statement is less than the
Working Capital Target Amount, Seller shall pay the lesser of the amount of
such deficiency and $1,000,000 to Buyer.   

(v) Any payment required pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) (the " _Final
Adjustment Amount_ ") shall be made in U.S. dollars 5 days after finalization
of the Final Adjustment Statement. Payments due shall be paid to the
applicable party together with interest at the Interest Rate from and
including the Closing Date to and excluding the date of payment.    

(c) _Excluded Liabilities_.   

(i) Seller shall be responsible for the payment of the following liabilities
(the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "):    

(A) the Companies bonuses accrued as of the Closing Date under the Companies
annual bonus plan calculated in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and in a manner consistent with the methodologies set
forth on _Schedule 2.2(c)(i)(A)_,    

(B) the Companies restructuring expenses accrued as of the Closing Date,
calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation of such amounts in the
Financial Statements, and    

(C) the amount of customer deposits by Sidley Austin held as of the Closing
Date, to the extent that the services for which prepayment was made have yet
to be performed, and    

(D) any customer discounts accrued as of the Closing Date, calculated in a
manner consistent with the methodologies set forth on _Schedule
2.2(c)(i)(D)_.   

(ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer (or its designee) the amounts of the Excluded
Liabilities set forth in Sections 2.2(c)(i)(B) and (C) above within five
Business Days after the Closing Date.   

(iii) Buyer shall deliver to Seller a calculation of the amount of accrued
bonuses calculated in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(i)(A) and of the amount
of accrued customer discounts calculated in accordance with Section
2.2(c)(i)(D), together with reasonable detail supporting each
such calculation, on or before the 30th day after the Closing Date (provided
that such 30th day is not before November 30, 2004). Seller shall have 15
days to review such calculations and raise objections if Seller believes that
the amounts have not been calculated in accordance with Section 2.2(c)(i)(A)
and Section 2.2(c)(i)(D), respectively. Any disputes with respect to the bonus
or customer discount calculations shall be resolved in a manner consistent
with the Neutral Auditor provisions set forth in Section 2.2(b)(iii). Seller
shall pay to Buyer (or its designee) cash in the amounts of the Excluded
Liabilities calculated as set forth in Sections 2.2(c)(i)(A) and (D) above
within five Business Days after the end of such 15-day review period or, if
Seller raises an objection within such period with respect to one or both
calculations, within five Business Days after the resolution of the resulting
dispute over such amount in accordance with the Neutral Auditor
provisions.   

(iv) Sellers payment to Buyer (or its designee) of the amounts of Excluded
Liabilities calculated in accordance with this Section 2.2 shall discharge
Sellers responsibility therefor, and thereafter the Companies shall be
solely responsible for the payment of all such Excluded Liabilities.   

Section 2.3 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and
the Transactions shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article VII hereof,
the closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the second Business Day after all of the conditions to the Closing set
forth in Article VI hereof are satisfied or waived (other than those that by
their terms cannot be satisfied prior to the Closing), or such other date,
time and place as shall be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (the actual date
being herein called the " _Closing Date_ ");  _provided_ that if Parent has
complied with Section 5.3(d) in all respects, then the Closing shall not
occur prior to the holding of the shareholders meeting contemplated by Section
5.3(d). The Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m., New York City
time, on the Closing Date.   

Section 2.4 _Buyer Deliveries_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver (a) the
Purchase Price and Non-Compete Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b)
hereof and (b) such documents and instruments set forth in Section 6.2 and
otherwise as counsel for Buyer and Seller mutually agree to be reasonably
necessary to consummate the Transactions.    

Section 2.5 _Seller Deliveries_. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer:   

(a) a good standing certificate from the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware for BBS dated as of a date no more than five Business Days prior to

(b) the Share Interests, including certificates representing the Share
Interests duly endorsed or accompanied by corporate powers duly executed in
blank or duly executed instruments of transfer; and   

(c) such other documents and instruments set forth in Section 6.3 and
otherwise as counsel for Buyer and Seller mutually agree to be reasonably
necessary to consummate the Transactions.   

ARTICLE III    

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER_     

Parent and Buyer agree that Sellers representations and warranties contained
in this Article III (except for those in Section 3.5(b)) shall not be deemed
breached, untrue or incorrect as a result of the failure to disclose or make
exceptions for matters concerning BWL Asia and its Subsidiaries. Subject to
the foregoing, Seller represents and warrants to Parent and Buyer that:   

Section 3.1 _Due Organization_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.1_, each
of Seller and the Companies is duly formed, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.1_, each of the Companies has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate the properties used in the
Business and to carry on the Business as presently conducted. Except as set
forth on  _Schedule 3.1_, each of the Companies is duly authorized,
qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and in good
standing in every jurisdiction wherein, by reason of the nature of the
Business, the failure to be so qualified would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   

Section 3.2 _Authorization and Validity of Agreement_. This Agreement and
the consummation by Seller of all of the Transactions have been duly
authorized by the Board of Directors of Seller and by all other requisite
corporate, shareholder or other action of Seller, and Seller has full
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Seller, and constitutes a valid and legally binding
obligation of Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be (a) limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights, or (b) subject
to general principles of equity.   

Section 3.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Seller and the consummation by Seller of the Transactions (a) will not
violate or conflict with any provision of the certificate of incorporation of
Seller or any Company and (b) assuming that all Consents set forth on
_Schedule 3.3_ and _Schedule 3.4_ have been obtained or made, will not (i)
violate any Law or Order to which Seller or any Company is subject or (ii)
result in any breach or creation of any Lien or constitute any default under,
or give any third Person any right to terminate, any contract, indenture,
mortgage, lease, note or other agreement or instrument to which Seller or any
Company is subject or is a party, except, in the case of clause (b), for
any such breach, default or creation of any Lien or termination right which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   

Section 3.4 _Governmental Approvals; Consents_. No claim, legal action,
suit, arbitration, governmental investigation, or other legal, judicial or
administrative proceeding (" _Action_ ") is pending or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened against Seller or any Company which would prevent or
delay the consummation of the Transactions. Except as set forth in  _Schedule
3.4_ and except for the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _Hart-Scott Act_ "), no Consent of
any Governmental Entity is or has been required on the part of Seller or the
Companies in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions.    

Section 3.5 _Share Interests; Ownership of Companies_    

(a) The Share Interests have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by Seller free and clear of all Liens, other than
those that will be released on or prior to the Closing Date or those created
by Parent or Buyer. Assuming Buyer has the requisite corporate or other power
and authority to be the lawful owner of the Share Interests, upon delivery of
the Share Interests to Buyer at the Closing and upon Sellers receipt of the
Initial Purchase Price, good and valid title to the Share Interests shall
pass to Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, other than those created by
Parent or Buyer. There are no outstanding options, warrants or other
rights of any kind relating to the sale, issuance or voting of any Share
Interests or any securities convertible into or evidencing the right to
purchase any Share Interests.   

(b) Except as indicated on _Schedule 3.5_, BBS has no Subsidiaries and owns
or holds of record and/or beneficially no shares of any class of capital
stock of or any ownership interests in any Persons. Except as indicated on
_Schedule 3.5_, Seller does not conduct the Business through any Subsidiary
except through the Companies. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.5_, BBS
owns all of the outstanding share capital or equivalent ownership interests of
each of the other Companies (including BWL Asia), free and clear of all
Liens, other than those that will be released on or prior to the Closing Date
or those created by Parent or Buyer.    

Section 3.6 _Financial Statements_    

(a) _Schedule 3.6(a)_ contains a copy of the unaudited pro forma balance
sheet of the Business as of December 31, 2003 and the related pro forma
statement of results of operations for the fiscal year ended on such date
(the " _Annual Financial Statements_ "). The Annual Financial Statements
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and
the results of the operations of the Business as of the date and for the
period indicated.  _Schedule 3.6(a)_ also contains the unaudited pro forma
balance sheet of Business as of June 30, 2004 (the " _Interim Balance Sheet_
") and the related pro forma statement of results of operations for the six-
month period ended on such date (together with the Interim Balance Sheet, the
" _Interim Financial Statements_ " and together with the Annual Financial
Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Interim Financial Statements
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition of Business
as of such date and the results of operations for the six-month period then
ended, subject to normal year-end adjustments. The Annual
Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements have been prepared
consistently with U.S. GAAP and consistently with BBS internal accounting
practices for equivalent prior accounting periods, except as may be disclosed
therein and except for the absence of footnote disclosures and cash
flow statements and, in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, subject
to normal year-end adjustments.   

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)_, BBS and its Subsidiaries had no
liability or obligation (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
which is not fully reflected or reserved against in the Interim Balance
Sheet, which, in accordance with GAAP, is a liability that should be
reflected on a balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto, other than (i)
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
June 30, 2004, (ii) liabilities and obligations otherwise disclosed in this
Agreement or the Schedules hereto, and (iii) liabilities and obligations
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, _Schedule 3.6(b)_ sets
forth, as of the date hereof, a list of all existing commitments to make any
material capital expenditure, except for immaterial expenditures and
commitments that do not exceed $200,000 in the aggregate.   

(c) Seller makes no representations or warranties regarding future financial
performance of the Companies or the Business or as to any financial or
business projections made available to Buyer regarding the Companies or the
Business.   

Section 3.7 _Absence of Changes_. Except as otherwise disclosed in _Schedule
3.7_ or in the other Schedules hereto or as contemplated by this Agreement,
since June 30, 2004 (a) the Business has been conducted in all material
respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and (b) there
has been no change, event, loss or occurrence affecting any of the
Companies that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.    

Section 3.8 _Real and Personal Properties_    

(a) BBS or one of its Subsidiaries has good title to, or a valid and binding
leasehold interest in, all material real and personal property used by the
Companies in the Business, including all assets reflected on the Interim
Balance Sheet except for properties or assets sold or otherwise disposed of
in the ordinary course of business since the date of the Interim
Balance Sheet, except for the real and personal properties listed on
_Schedule 3.8(a)_, which schedule identifies real and personal properties
owned or leased by Seller or Affiliates thereof other than the Companies, the
ownership and leasehold interests of which will be transferred to
the Companies on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with Section 5.11
(the " _Affiliated Assets_ "). Such ownership or leasehold interest is free
and clear of all Liens, except (i) as set forth on _Schedule 3.8(a)_; (ii)
Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or, if due, (A) not delinquent or (B)
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for which
reserves have been provided in the Financial Statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP; (iii) mechanics, workmens, repairmens, warehousemens,
carriers or other like Liens arising or incurred in the ordinary course of
business if the underlying obligations are not more than 30 days past due or
are being contested in good faith; (iv) Liens or title retention arrangements
arising under original purchase price conditional sales contracts and
equipment leases with third parties entered into in the ordinary course of
business; and (v) other Liens that do not materially impair the value or
use of such real or personal property (such Liens described in clauses (ii)
through (v) hereof are referred to herein as " _Permitted Liens_ "). Seller
has provided Buyer with true and complete copies of any conditional sales
contracts and equipment leases described in clause (iv) above that require
the Companies to make annual payments in excess of $200,000.   

(b) As of the date hereof, _Schedule 3.8(b)_ hereto sets forth a complete and
correct list of all material real property leased by the Companies, or owned
or leased by Seller or an Affiliate thereof, and used in the Business (the "
_Leased Property_ "). Seller has made available to Buyer for its review of
true and complete copies of all lease, sublease and amendments thereto
pertaining to the Leased Property. The Companies own no real property.    

Section 3.9 _Contracts_    

(a) As of the date hereof, _Schedule 3.9(a)_ sets forth a correct and
complete list of, and Seller has provided Buyer with true and complete copies
of (provided that immaterial amendments made in the ordinary course of
business with respect to contracts or other agreements with the Top 25
Customers, which amendments are not in the aggregate material, have not been
provided to Buyer), each of the contracts, agreements, leases and licenses of
the types set forth below (collectively, the " _Material Contracts_ "):   

(i) any contracts or other agreements with the Business 25 largest customers
by revenue recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2004 (the " _Top 25
Customers_ ");   

(ii) any contracts or other agreements that involve aggregate payments or
other consideration by or to the Companies in excess of $200,000 per year,
including contracts with suppliers, vendors and lessors but excluding
contracts with customers and contracts with employees;   

(iii) any contracts or other agreements under which any of the Companies has
incurred or guaranteed any Indebtedness or has made any loan or advance to
any director, officer or employee (excluding travel, petty cash, pay-roll and
similar advances in the ordinary course of business);    

(iv) any joint venture or partnership agreements to which any Company is a
party;   

(v) any contracts or other agreements that limit or restrict any Company (or
any of its Affiliates) from engaging in any line of business or in business
in any geographical area;   

(vi) any contracts or other agreements to which any Company is a party that
have been entered into outside the ordinary course of business (excluding
arrangements with Affiliates listed on  _Schedule 3.18_); and   

(vii) any contracts or other agreements with a customer of the Business that
contain a so-called "most favored nation" obligation on the part of any of
the Companies (or similar obligation requiring any of the Companies to offer
any Person contractual terms or provisions that are no less favorable then
terms or provisions offered to any other Person).   

(b) To Sellers Knowledge, and as of the date of this Agreement, except as set
forth on  _Schedule 3.9(b)_, (i) each Material Contract is valid and binding
on the parties thereto (except to the extent that the invalidity or non-
binding nature of any Material Contract would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect) and (ii) neither
Seller nor any of the Companies that is a party thereto is in material
default in the performance of its obligations under any such Material
Contract.   

(c) As of the date hereof, _Schedule 3.9(c)_ sets forth a list of all
contracts that are primarily related to the Business, or (although used also
in other businesses of Seller and/or its Subsidiaries) are necessary to the
operation of the Business in the manner it is currently operated, to which
Seller or an Affiliate thereof other than a Company is the contracting
party (" _Affiliated Contracts_ ") involving aggregate payments or other
consideration by or to the Companies in excess of $200,000. Seller has
provided Buyer with true and correct copies of all such Affiliated
Contracts.   

Section 3.10 _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.10_, there are
no (a) Orders against Seller or any of the Companies or (b) Actions pending
or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened in law or in equity, before any
Governmental Entity or arbitral tribunal, against Seller or any Company
which, if determined or resolved adversely, would have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   

Section 3.11 _Compliance with Laws_. To Sellers Knowledge, except as

Buyer and by all other requisite corporate, shareholder or other action of
Parent and Buyer, and each of Parent and Buyer has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its

made, will not (i) violate any Law or Order to which Parent or Buyer is

any default under any contract, indenture, mortgage, lease, note or other
agreement or instrument to which Parent or Buyer is subject or is a party,
except, in the case of clause (b), for any such breach, default or creation
of any Lien which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.   

Section 4.4 _Governmental Approvals; Consents_. Neither Parent nor Buyer is
subject to any Order which would prevent the consummation of the
Transactions. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Buyer,
threatened against Parent or Buyer which would prevent or delay the
Transactions. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.4_ hereto and except for
the requirements of the Hart-Scott Act, no Consent of any Governmental Entity
is or has been required on the part of Parent or Buyer in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the

or consummating the Transactions.

competent legal counsel, (b) have knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters, including specifically integrated information management
service businesses, (c) have the capability of evaluating the merits and
risks of purchasing the Share Interests, and (d) are not in a
disparate bargaining position with Seller. Parent and Buyer acknowledge that
they and their representatives have been permitted such access to the books
and records, facilities, equipment, tax returns, contracts, insurance
policies (or summaries thereof) and other properties and assets of
the Companies that they and their representatives have desired or requested
to see or review, and that they and their representatives have had such
opportunity to meet with the officers and employees of Seller and the
Companies to discuss the businesses and assets of the Companies as Parent and
Buyer deemed necessary. None of Seller, the Companies, their representatives
or any other Person shall have or be subject to any liability (other than for
fraud) to Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent
or Buyer, or Parents or Buyers use, of any such information with respect to
the Business and any information, documents or materials made available to
Parent and Buyer in management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of the Transactions.   

Section 4.7 _Purchase for Investment_. Parent and Buyer are aware that the
Share Interests are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (together
with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_
"), or under any state or foreign securities laws. Neither Parent nor Buyer
is an underwriter, as such term is defined under the Securities Act, and is
purchasing such interests solely for investment, with no present intention to
distribute any such interests to any Person, and neither Parent nor Buyer will
sell or otherwise dispose of the Share Interests except in compliance with
the registration requirements or exemption provisions under the Securities
Act and any other applicable securities laws.   

Section 4.8 _Financial Capacity; No Financing Condition_. Parent and Buyer
have available to them committed bank financing and other funds sufficient to
consummate the Transactions (including the payment of all related fees and
expenses incurred by them). Parent and Buyer understand that their
obligations to effect the Transactions are not subject to the availability to
Parent and Buyer of financing. Parent has provided Seller with a true and
complete copy of a senior credit agreement and mezzanine facility agreement
with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (the " _Financing Commitments_ "). None
of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified in any material
respect (individually or in the aggregate), and the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn or
rescinded in any respect. The Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect. There is no condition precedent or other contingency related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or
contemplated by the Financing Commitments. The parties to the Financing
Commitments are in the "Availability Period" with respect to each
"Acquisition Facility" as contemplated therein, which period expires the
earlier of the Closing Date and December 31, 2004. As of the date
hereof, neither Parent nor Buyer has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments within
the control of Parent and Buyer will not be satisfied or that the Financing
will not be made available to Buyer on the Closing Date. Parent (or one or
more of its officers on behalf of Parent) has received valid and enforceable
(under U.K. law or any other applicable Law) irrevocable voting undertakings
(the " _Voting Undertakings_ ") from holders of Parent shares that represent
Parents power to vote more than 75% of the outstanding votes of Parents
capital stock in favor of the matters described on  _Schedule 4.2_, and such
Voting Undertakings represent a number of shares necessary to approve the
matters described in on _Schedule 4.2_.   

Section 4.9 _Finders; Brokers_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.9_,
neither Parent nor Buyer is a party to any agreement with any finder or

fees or expenses, in connection with the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions.   

Section 4.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, neither Parent
or Buyer nor any other Person makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty on behalf of Parent or Buyer.

including filing, or causing to be filed, (x) as promptly as practicable and
in any event within five Business Days of the date of this Agreement, any
required notification and report forms (x) under the Hart-Scott Act with the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or (y) as
promptly as practicable, any other applicable filings under other applicable
non-U.S. Laws with the applicable non-U.S. Governmental Antitrust Authority,
to the extent that Seller has a legal obligation, (ii) to provide as promptly
as practicable information and documents requested by any Governmental
Antitrust Authority necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the Transactions; (iii) to obtain any Consent of any Governmental Antitrust
Authority required to be obtained or made by Seller, Parent and Buyer, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and
(iv) to defend vigorously, lift, mitigate or rescind the effect of any
litigation or administrative proceeding involving any Governmental Antitrust
Authority adversely affecting the Transactions or this Agreement, including
promptly appealing any adverse court or administrative decision. Without
limitation of the foregoing, Seller, Buyer, Parent and their respective
Affiliates shall request early termination and shall not extend any waiting
period or comparable period under the Hart-Scott Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Antitrust Authority not to consummate the
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other party
hereto. Without limitation of the foregoing, until the earlier to occur of
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any term sheet, letter of intent,
agreement or other understanding with respect to any acquisition of stock,
assets, a division or a business that could adversely affect the review or
approval by the FTC or Antitrust Division, as applicable, of the
Transactions under the Hart-Scott Act.   

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings and subsection (a) of
this Section 5.3, and subject to appropriate confidentiality protections,
Seller (on the one hand) and Parent and Buyer (on the other hand) shall each
furnish to the other party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may request in connection with the foregoing and
shall each promptly provide counsel for the other party with copies of all
filings made by such party, and all correspondence between such party (and
its advisors) with any Governmental Antitrust Authority and any other
information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to
a Governmental Antitrust Authority in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions. Each party shall, subject to applicable Law, permit counsel for
the other party to review in advance any proposed written and, if
practicable, oral, communication to any Governmental Antitrust
Authority. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, in
case at any time after the Closing Date any further action is necessary or
desirable to secure the approvals from any and all Governmental Antitrust
Authorities necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper
officers and/or directors of the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to
take or cause to be taken all such further action.    

(c) The filing fees under the Hart-Scott Act or any other similar Law shall be
borne by Buyer.   

(d) Parent shall send the notice required by U.K. or other applicable Law to
convene a shareholders meeting to vote on the financing required to

vote the Voting Undertakings in favor of the matters described on _Schedule
4.2_.   

(e) Seller shall cause all Liens arising under the Credit Agreement and the
Note Purchase Agreement (each as defined in _Schedule 3.3_) to be removed
from the capital stock and assets of the Companies not later than
simultaneously with the Closing.   

Section 5.4 _Public Announcements_. The parties shall issue a joint press
release, mutually acceptable to Seller (on the one hand) and Buyer and Parent
(on the other hand), promptly upon execution of this Agreement. Thereafter,
prior to the Closing Date, no party to this Agreement will issue any press
release or make any other public disclosures concerning the Transactions or
the contents of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other party. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Section 5.4 will
preclude any party from making any disclosures required by Law (including the
rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which the shares of such
party are traded) or necessary and proper in conjunction with the filing of
any tax return or other document required to be filed with any Governmental
Entity;  _provided_ that the party required to make the release or statement
shall allow the other party reasonable time under the circumstances to review
and comment on such release or statement in advance of such issuance.   

Section 5.5 _Continuing Access to Records and Personnel_. Buyer or the
Companies shall retain the books, records, documents, instruments, accounts,
correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers relating to the
Companies in Buyers possession (the " _Books and Records_ ") for the period
of time set forth in Parents records retention policies on the Closing Date
or for such longer period as may be required by Law or any applicable Order,
but in any event for at least seven years. After the seven-year period,
before Buyer or any Company shall dispose of any Books and Records, Parent or
Buyer shall give at least 45 calendar days prior written notice to such
effect to Seller, and Seller shall be given the opportunity, at its
expense, to remove or duplicate and retain all or any part of such Books and
Records as Seller may select. Buyer will, and shall cause the Companies to,
allow Seller and its representatives reasonable access to such Books and
Records, and to personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts and/or contents
of such Books and Records, for legitimate business reasons, such as the
preparation of tax returns or the defense of litigation. Buyer or the
Companies (as the case may be) shall be entitled to recover its actual out-
of-pocket costs (including copying costs) incurred in providing such records
and/or personnel to Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, tax and accounting
records of the Companies that are the subject of Section 8.6(e) shall be
governed by the provisions thereof.    

Section 5.6 _WARN Notices_    

(a) Any workforce reductions carried out following the Closing Date by Parent,
Buyer or the Companies shall be done in accordance with all applicable Laws
governing the employment relationship and termination thereof including the
WARN Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable state or
local Law.   

(b) No later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall provide Buyer with a list setting forth the number of employees
terminated from each site of employment of the Companies during the 90-day
period ending on the Closing Date (which list shall not include any employees
which may be terminated on the Closing Date at the direction of Buyer) for
reasons qualifying the termination as "employment losses" under the WARN Act
and the date of each such termination with respect to each termination;
_provided_ , that this sentence shall not apply with respect to any site of
employment at which sufficient employees have not been employed at any time
in such 90-day period for terminations of employment at such site to be
subject to the WARN Act.    

Section 5.7 _Intercompany Guarantees_    

(a) Parent shall cause itself, Buyer or one or more of its other Affiliates to
be substituted in all respects for Seller and its Affiliates, effective as of
the Closing Date, in respect of all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates
under each of the guarantees, indemnities, surety bonds, performance bonds,
letters of credit and other credit support arrangements obtained by Seller
and its Affiliates for the sole benefit of the Companies (the " _Guarantees_
") and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies) to be released, as of the Closing Date,
from any obligations under such Guarantees; _provided_ that nothing in this
Section 5.7 shall require Parent or Buyer to guarantee any Indebtedness.   

(b) As long as Seller or its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies) (i) has
any obligations for payment or performance under any Guarantee, (ii) is a
party to any Affiliated Contract, or (iii) was a party but remains liable for
any payment or performance by any Company after the Closing, (1) Buyer shall
maintain one or more errors and omissions policies on customary terms
and amounts to insure the Companies in the conduct of the Business for at
least $50 million in the aggregate and (2) Parent shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Seller and its Affiliates (if any) to be named as
additional insured parties under such errors and policies insofar as Seller
and/or such Affiliates could be liable as guarantor for such insured
risks.    

Section 5.8 _Transition Services; Use of Name_    

(a) Seller shall at the request of Buyer provide the Companies, for a period
of up to 12 months from the Closing Date, with the services set forth on
_Schedule 5.8(a)_ (" _Buyer Requested Transition Services_ ") which are
currently being provided by Seller or Affiliates thereof to the Companies.
Buyer shall pay for any such Buyer Requested Transition Services based on the
allocated inter-company cost for such services in effect on the date hereof as
set forth on  _Schedule 5.8(a)_. Buyer may terminate the provision of any
such Buyer Requested Transition Services at any time on not less than 30
days prior notice. Seller shall have no obligation to continue to provide
any Buyer Request Transition Services after the end of such 12-month
period. Seller shall not change the infrastructure and systems that are
required to provide the Buyer Requested Transition Services in a manner that
would materially compromise the cost and provision of such services required
hereby until Seller is no longer required to provide such service; 
_provided_ that infrastructure and systems related to Benefit Plans may be
changed in any respect or terminated by Seller after December 31, 2004.
Exceptions to any terms of this Section 5.8(a) shall be as set forth in
_Schedule 5.8(a)_.   

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, at the request of Seller,
provide Seller and its Subsidiaries, for a period of up to 12 months from the
Closing Date, with the services set forth on _Schedule 5.8(b)_ (" _Seller
Requested Transition Services_ ") which are currently being provided by the
Companies in connection with the Excluded Assets. Seller shall pay for any
such Seller Requested Transition Services based on the allocated inter-company
cost for such services in effect on the date hereof as set forth on _Schedule
5.8(b)_. Seller may terminate the provision of any such Seller Requested
Transition Services at any time on not less than 30 days prior notice. Buyer
shall have no obligation to continue to provide any such Seller Requested
Transition Services after the end of such 12-month period. Buyer shall not,
and shall cause the Companies not to, change the infrastructure and systems
that are required to provide the Seller Requested Transition Services in a
manner that would materially compromise the cost and provision of such
services required hereby until Buyer is no longer required to provide
such service. Exceptions to any terms of this Section 5.8(b) shall be as set
forth in _Schedule 5.8(b)_.   

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Seller hereby grants
the Companies a royalty-free, paid-up, non-sublicensable, non-assignable,
non-exclusive right and license to use the "Bowne Business Solutions" name
and related marks or names listed on _Schedule 5.8(c)_ (the " _Bowne Names
and Marks_ ") commencing at the Closing until June 30, 2005 solely in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and solely in
connection with the Business in order to effectuate the transition and
cessation of the use of the Bowne Names and Marks in a commercially
reasonable manner to avoid customer confusion. After June 30, 2005,
the Companies shall cease all use of the Bowne Names and Marks, except that
the Companies may continue to identify the Business as being "formerly Bowne
Business Solutions" solely in a non-trademark sense and in a fair and
accurate manner in connection with the historical description of
the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, all right, title and interest of
Seller or its Affiliates in the name or mark "Business Solutions" solely for
use in connection with the Business shall be transferred with the Business
and thereafter be vested in the Companies; _provided_ that Seller makes no
representation or warranty as to the existence or enforceability of any such
right, title or interest and Seller is transferring only such right, title or
interest in such phrase as Seller may have acquired through its use as part
of the mark "Bowne Business Solutions" in connection with the Business.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no right, title or interest
in the Bowne Names and Marks listed on _Schedule 5.8(c)_ is being transferred
to Parent, Buyer or the Companies, except for the limited license provided in
the first sentence of this Section 5.8(c).   

(d) Seller shall take such other actions set forth on _Schedule 5.8(d)_ to
assist Parent and Buyer in separating the Companies from the Sellers group.
Seller will pay or reimburse certain such separation expenses set forth on
_Schedule 5.8(d)_ except as otherwise specified therein or in Section
9.2(b). Ongoing services set forth on _Schedule 5.8(d)_ shall be set forth
in the transition services agreement contemplated by Section 5.8(e), and shall
be provided for a period of up to 12 months from the Closing Date. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 5.8(d)_ or specifically provided elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not have any obligation to pay or reimburse Buyer or
the Companies for any other increased costs that may be incurred as a
consequence of the Companies no longer being part of Sellers group. Nothing
in this clause (d) shall require Seller to provide Buyer Requested Transition
Services for a longer period than is contemplated by clause (a) or to permit
the use of the Bowne Names and Marks for a longer period than is contemplated
by clause (c).   

(e) Seller shall, and Buyer shall cause BBS to, at or prior to the Closing
enter into a transition services agreement, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A, or another appropriate agreement providing for the provision of
services and other assistance contemplated by this Section 5.8 and/or the
other matters contemplated by Sections 5.10, 5.11(c), and 5.12(b).   

Section 5.9 _Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable_. Seller and Buyer agree
that, as between themselves, the benefit of all accounts receivable and other
receivables of the Business and the Companies, and all accounts payable and
other trade payables of the Business and the Companies, in each case in
existence as of the Closing but whether relating to or arising from
the period prior to, on or subsequent to the Closing, shall be for the
account of and for the benefit and burden of Buyer. To the extent that Seller
or any of its Affiliates receive any funds to which a Company is entitled
pursuant to the preceding sentence, Seller shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to, promptly deliver such funds to an account designated in
writing by Buyer. If Seller or its Affiliates pay any accounts/trade payables
of the Companies after the Closing Date, Parent and Buyer shall promptly
cause the relevant Company to reimburse Seller for such payment.   

Section 5.10 _Termination of Affiliate Arrangements_. Except as contemplated
by this Agreement or as set forth in _Schedule 5.10_, on or prior to the
Closing Date, the Companies shall have repaid or otherwise settled all of
their outstanding Indebtedness (including interest thereon) and satisfied all
of its other liabilities (other than payables for goods sold and services
rendered which shall be paid in the ordinary course of business) owed to
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies), and Seller and its
Affiliates shall have repaid or otherwise settled all of their outstanding
Indebtedness (including interest thereon) and satisfied all of their other
liabilities (other than payables for goods sold and services rendered which
shall be paid in the ordinary course of business) owed to the Companies. All
agreements between the Companies and Seller or its other Affiliates, other
than agreements contemplated by this Agreement and agreements listed on
_Schedule 5.10_, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and
all obligations and liabilities thereunder shall have been satisfied.    

Section 5.11 _Transfer of Excluded and Affiliated Assets; Affiliated
Contracts_    

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Companies to take
all actions required to transfer the assets set forth on _Schedule 5.11(a)_
(the " _Excluded Assets_ ") to an Affiliate of Seller. Such Excluded Assets
will be transferred in the manner set forth on _Schedule 5.11(a)_, and all
costs of such transfer shall be for the account of Seller, except to the
extent set forth on _Schedule 5.11(a)_ and in Section 9.2(b). Parent and
Buyer acknowledge and agree that the Excluded Assets will not be part of the
Companies after the Closing Date and will cooperate with Seller in assisting
with such transfer of assets (including assisting in obtaining any requisite
consents of third parties in connection with such transfer as promptly as
practicable therefor) in the event that any Excluded Assets are not properly
transferred out of the Companies prior to the Closing.   

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions required to
transfer the Affiliated Assets (to the extent of the interest therein
identified in _Schedule 3.8(a)_) to BBS (or, if appropriate under the
circumstances, another Company), free and clear of any Liens except for
Permitted Liens. All costs of such transfer shall be equally shared between
Seller and Buyer unless otherwise set forth in _Schedule 3.8(a)_ or in
Section 9.2(b). In the event that any Affiliated Asset is not properly
transferred to the Companies on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
(i) take all actions required to transfer such Affiliated Asset to BBS (or,
if appropriate, another Company), (ii) hold such Affiliated Asset for the
benefit of the Companies and take all actions necessary to allow the
Companies to enjoy such benefit pending its transfer and (ii) bear all costs
of such interim arrangements.   

(c) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions required to
assign the Affiliated Contracts, including those on _Schedule 3.8(a)_,
except as otherwise set forth therein, to BBS (or, if appropriate under the
circumstances, another Company). Such assignment shall be by novation (i.e.,
non-recourse to the assignor) if and to the extent agreed by the contractual
counterparty. All costs of such transfer shall be equally shared between
Seller and Buyer unless otherwise set forth in _Schedule 3.8(a)_ or in
Section 9.2(b). In the event that any Affiliated Contract, including those
identified on _Schedule 3.8(a)_, except as otherwise set forth therein,
cannot be assigned on or prior to the Closing Date because such assignment
requires the consent of the counterparty and such consent is not timely
received, (i) Seller shall, to the maximum extent consistent with the terms
of such Affiliated Contract, make available to the Companies the benefits of
such Affiliated Contract, (ii) the Companies shall, to the extent (but only
to the extent) of benefits actually received reimburse Seller for any
payments required to be made thereunder, (iii) Seller and Buyer shall
continue to cooperate to facilitate the assignment of such Affiliated
Contract as promptly as practicable thereafter, and (iv) if such Affiliated
Contract is a customer contract, Seller shall following the Closing continue
to make all commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the assignment of
such Affiliated Contract to BBS or another Company and to mitigate any
adverse consequences to the Companies that arise as a result of the delay in
such assignment.    

Section 5.12 _Sublease of Certain Seller Office Space_    

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller (or its relevant Affiliate, as
determined by Seller) and BBS (or, if appropriate under the circumstances,
another Company, as determined by Buyer) shall enter into sublease (or, if
Seller or an Affiliate thereof is the owner, lease) arrangements for each of
the current Company office locations set forth on, and in accordance with the
terms set forth on, _Schedule 5.12_.   

(b) Unless otherwise set forth on _Schedule 5.12_, each sublease (or, if
applicable, lease) shall (i) have a term of the lesser of two years after the
Closing or the period remaining until the termination of the underlying
lease, (ii) provide for rent at cost in an amount consistent with the rates
charged to the Companies as of the date hereof, subject to
reasonable adjustments (including to adjust for additional services requested
by the Companies, increases in rent on the primary lease and other variable
costs) that the parties shall negotiate and agree upon in good faith, and
(iii) require 6 months prior notice for termination, which notice may not
be delivered prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date. Unless
otherwise agreed in writing, Seller shall (at its own cost) partition the
space subleased (or, if applicable, leased) to BBS in a commercially
reasonable and cost efficient manner so that the Business will be
reasonably separate from the businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries and
secure after the Closing during the term of the sublease (or, if applicable,
lease) to BBS in the locations and manner set forth in  _Schedule 5.12(b)_.
In respect of each office location set forth on _Schedule 5.12_, Seller
shall for the term of the sublease provide such security, maintenance,
utilities and other support services as are provided on the date hereof at
the current recharge cost therefor (subject to reasonable adjustments for
third party cost increases).   

(c) In connection with the foregoing, the parties shall cooperate to obtain
all requisite consents relating to Sellers (or its Affiliates) applicable
leases for office locations set forth on _Schedule 5.12_. Any costs related
to such consent and sublease shall be equally shared between Seller and Buyer
unless otherwise set forth in _Schedule 5.12_ or in Section 9.2(b).    

Section 5.13 _Employee Matters_    

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Parent and
Buyer shall cause the Companies to provide the Company Employees with
employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to such Company Employees on the date hereof (it being acknowledged
that, as a private company, neither Parent nor Buyer will offer equity-based
programs and that the foregoing is not intended to convert any discretionary
bonuses into obligatory payments).   

(b) Parent and Buyer shall cause the Companies to give Company Employees full
credit for all purposes, including eligibility and vesting and benefit
accrual (except for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension,
supplemental executive retirement or similar plan), under such employee
benefit plans or arrangements established by Buyer in which such Company
Employees may participate, for such Company Employees service recognized by
the Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date under comparable Benefit
Plans.   

(c) Parent and Buyer shall cause the Companies to (i) waive all limitations as
to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Closing Date and (ii) provide each Company
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans that such Company Employees are eligible
to participate in after the Closing Date.    

Section 5.14 _Tax Matters_     

(a) Seller shall or shall cause the Companies to:   

(i) prepare, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice (except as otherwise required by Law), and timely file all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it (or them) for any taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_ "), except that,
in the case of any such Tax Return to be filed by any of the Companies on a
separate basis, Seller shall timely deliver such Tax Return to the
appropriate Company for filing;   

(ii) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Pre-
Closing Tax Period Tax Returns that are so filed or, in the case of any such
Tax Return to be filed by the Companies on a separate basis as contemplated
by clause (a)(i), pay the requisite amount over to the Companies for full and
timely payment of all such Taxes except to the extent such Taxes
are reflected as an accrued Tax liability on the Financial Statements and
have been taken into account in determining the Final Adjustment
Amount;   

(iii) promptly notify Buyer of any material federal, state, local or foreign
Action or audit pending against or with respect to the Companies in respect
of any Tax matter, including Tax liabilities and refund claims, and not
settle or compromise any such Action or audit without Buyers consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld;   

(iv) prior to the Closing, terminate any and all tax indemnity, tax sharing or
tax allocation agreement among Seller and the Companies such that there is no
further liability thereunder.   

(b) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file or cause to be
filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Companies for taxable years or periods ending after the
Closing Date and shall remit any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns. With respect to Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Companies for Straddle Periods (" _Straddle Returns_ "), such
Straddle Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
(unless otherwise required by law). Buyer shall deliver, at least 30 days
prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Return (including extension),
to Seller a statement setting forth the amount of Tax allocated to Seller
pursuant to Section 5.14(c) (the " _Tax Statement_ ") and copies of such
Straddle Return. Seller shall have the right to review such Straddle Return
and the Tax Statement prior to the filing of such Straddle Return and,
within ten days after the date of receipt by Seller of any Straddle Return,
to request in writing any reasonable changes to such Straddle Return. If
Seller agrees with the Tax Statement (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld), Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount shown thereon as due
and owning with respect to the Tax allocated to Seller pursuant to Section
5.14(c) except to the extent such Taxes are reflected as an accrued Tax
liability on the Financial Statements and have been taken into account in
determining the Final Adjustment Amount. Seller and Buyer agree to consult
and resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result of the review of such
Straddle Return and the Tax Statement and mutually to consent to the filing as
promptly as possible of such Straddle Return. In the event the parties are
unable to resolve any dispute within ten days after Buyer has received
Sellers written request for changes, then any disputed issues shall be
promptly submitted to the Neutral Auditor selected pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(iii) to resolve in a final binding matter prior to the due date for
such Straddle Return. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor shall be
shared equally between Seller and Buyer. Parent shall cause Buyer to do all
things required under this provision.   

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of the Companies
that are payable with respect to any Tax period that begins before and ends
after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such
Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including, and the portion or the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing
Date shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or
related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale,
transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment of property
(real or personal, tangible or intangible), be determined by assuming
that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which
ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of
the Companies for the Straddle Period will be allocated between such two
taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" (in accordance
with GAAP) by assuming that the books of the Companies were closed at the
close of the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than
those described in clause (i) above) that are imposed on a periodic basis, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of
clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item (including the effect of any graduated rates of tax) that is
calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with past practice of the Companies. The parties
hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the
relevant Governmental Entity to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a
short taxable period ending as of the close of business on the Closing
Date.   

Section 5.15 _Customer Coordination_. Seller, Parent and Buyer shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and coordinate
with each other to facilitate the smooth transition of the Companies
customers to Buyer and its Subsidiaries after the Closing as contemplated by
this Agreement, including obtaining the consents required to consummate the
Transactions contemplated by Section 5.7 and Section 5.11. Parent, Buyer and
their Affiliates shall not contact or communicate with the Companies
customers in connection with the Transactions without first coordinating such
contacts and/or communications with Seller and then only in accordance with
the plans and procedures approved in advance by Seller.   

Section 5.16 _Severance and Bonus Payments_. Seller shall pay directly to
the individuals set forth in _Schedule 5.16_, or reimburse the applicable
Company for, any severance or stay bonus payments, which are payable to such
individuals in accordance with such individuals retention and change of
control agreement as such agreement exists as of the Closing Date. Buyer
shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to, amend or waive any provision
of the retention and change of control contract, severance arrangement or
other document, in any manner which would increase or accelerate such
individuals entitlement to such payments. Amounts payable under this Section
5.16 shall be net of any severance amounts that have been accounted for in
the calculations set forth in Section 2.2.    

Section 5.17 _Covenant Not to Compete_    

(a) Seller agrees that, for a period of three years after the Closing (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), it shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, engage, anywhere in the world,
whether as a principal, partner, stockholder, agent or consultant, in the
Business (for purposes of this Section 5.17 only, as defined in
_Schedule 5.17(a)_ ).   

(b) During the Restricted Period, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly, (i) induce any customer of the Companies or
any other Person with whom the Companies has a business relationship, whether
contractual or otherwise, to discontinue, or alter in a manner materially
adverse to the business of the Companies, such business relationship, or (ii)
solicit or induce any employee of the Companies to leave the employment of
the Companies; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing shall not (i)
preclude any solicitation by Seller or any of its Affiliates through general
advertising not specifically directed at the employees of the Company or (ii)
preclude Seller or its Affiliates from employing any individual who
independently contacts the Seller or such Affiliate seeking employment.   

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.17,
the Seller and its Affiliates may (i) engage in the businesses and activities
described in _Schedule 5.17(c)_ and (ii) own or acquire, directly or
indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person, whether or not
traded on any securities exchange, if neither the Seller nor any of
its Affiliates is a controlling Person of, or a member of a group that
controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of
any class of equity securities of such Person.   

(d) If the Seller breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the
provisions of this Section 5.17 (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ "), Parent and
Buyer shall have the right and remedy without regard to any other available
remedy to (i) have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced by any
court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) have issued an
injunction restraining any such breach; it being agreed that the Seller will
not challenge an assertion by Parent or Buyer that any breach of any of the
Restrictive Covenants will cause irreparable injury to Parent or Buyer, nor
will the Seller assert as a defense to any such attempt to obtain
equitable relief that money damages will provide an adequate remedy to Parent
and Buyer. Under no circumstances shall Parent or Buyer be required to post a
bond to enforce this covenant.   

(e) It is the desire and intent of the parties that the Restrictive Covenants
will be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public
policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, if any Restrictive Covenant shall be adjudicated to be invalid
or unenforceable, such Restrictive Covenant shall be deemed amended to the
extent necessary in order that such provision be valid and enforceable, such
amendment to apply only with respect to the operation of such Restrictive
Covenant in the particular jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made.
The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Restrictive Covenants
are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in all other
respects. If any court determines that any of the Restricted Covenants, or
any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the
Restrictive Covenants shall not be affected thereby and shall be given
full effect without regard to the invalid portions.   

Section 5.18 _Guarantee of Buyer s Obligations_. Parent shall cause Buyer to
perform all of Buyers obligations arising under this Agreement.   

Section 5.19 _Termination of Joint Venture_. Each of Seller and Parent shall
cause its applicable Affiliate to, at the Closing, (i) terminate the joint
venture agreement, dated as of November 19, 1996, as amended, between Bowne
Venture Corporation and Williams Lea International Limited (formerly known as
Williams Lea Consulting Limited), (b) take all reasonable steps to dissolve
Bowne Williams Lea International, a New York partnership, as soon as
practicable, and (c) waive any and all claims of such Affiliate arising under
such joint venture agreement or in respect of Bowne Williams Lea
International.

terminated and any Consent of a Governmental Entity or other Person specified

case as of such earlier date), except for such breaches of representations
and warranties that, in the aggregate (and excluding for this purpose

though made as of such date, except to the extent such representations and
warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct on and as of such
earlier date), except for such breaches of representations and warranties
that, in the aggregate (and excluding for this purpose any materiality
exceptions therein), would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and
Parent and Buyer shall have received a certificate from an authorized
officer of Seller to such effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.7, (i) the
termination of any customer contracts or the non-renewal of any customer
contracts, (ii) the loss of any revenue or profit relating to the matters set
forth in _Schedule 3.20_, or (iii) the failure to transfer customer
contracts, to the extent not combined with other adverse events or
developments, shall be governed by the applicable conditions set forth in
Section 6.3(d) and Section 6.3(e), and this Section 6.3(a) shall not provide
an additional condition precedent in relation to such events. The parties
agree that the $2.5 million threshold set forth in Section 6.3(e) shall not
be considered in analyzing whether the condition set forth in this Section
6.3(a) has been satisfied.   

(b) _Performance of Covenants_. Seller shall have performed or complied in
all material respects with all obligations and covenants required by this
Agreement to be performed prior to or at the Closing, and Parent and Buyer

the Closing Date, there shall have occurred no event or development that has
had, or would be reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the termination of any customer

and this Section 6.3(c) shall not provide an additional condition precedent

condition set forth in this Section 6.3(c) has been satisfied.   

(d) _Transfer of Certain Agreements_. The customer contracts set forth on
_Schedule 6.3(d)_ shall have been assigned to BBS in accordance with Section
5.11.

the annual gross profit determined in accordance with _Schedule 6.3(e)_, in
the aggregate, represented by such terminating Top 25 Customers contract(s)
exceeds the amount set forth in _Schedule 6.3(e)_; _provided_ that
neither Parent nor Buyer may rely on this Section 6.3(e) after the Walk-Away
Deadline. For the avoidance of doubt, if customer contracts expire by their
terms and are not renewed, the annual gross profit of such expired contracts
shall not be counted for purposes of the closing condition set forth
in Section 6.3(e). In addition, no loss of annual gross profit attributable
to the matters set forth in _Schedule 3.20_ shall be counted for purposes of
this Section 6.3(e).   

" _Walk-Away Deadline_ " means the earlier to occur of (A) the date that the

6.3(e) has been satisfied) but for the actions, or failures to take action
(including any failures to satisfy any of the conditions to the Closing due
to matters within the control of Parent, Buyer or other Affiliates) of Parent,
Buyer or their Affiliates; _provided_ that for purposes of clarity, any delay
in having the shareholder vote contemplated in Section 4.8 shall not extend
this period, or (B) the 10th Business Day after delivery by Seller of written
notice notifying Buyer of one or more terminations of customer contracts as
contemplated by Section 6.3(e); _provided_ that if any other termination(s)
with respect to other Top 25 Customers contracts occurs or any other
adverse information concerning the Companies is received after the initial
(or any subsequent) 10 Business Day period, then the Walk-Away Deadline for
purposes of clause (B) shall be the 10th Business Day after the delivery by
Seller of written notice notifying Buyer of such subsequent termination(s)
or the receipt of any such adverse information.   

ARTICLE VII    

 _TERMINATION_     

Section 7.1 _Termination Events_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned:    

(a) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto;   

(b) by Seller or Buyer, each in its sole discretion, if the Closing shall not

written agreement of the parties hereto;   

(c) by Seller if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 shall

warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement at the time
of termination, other than with respect to a breach that is caused by any act
or omission of a third party.   

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of the
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1 above, this Agreement shall forthwith
become wholly void and of no further force and effect and there shall be no

obligations of Parent, Buyer and Seller under Sections 5.2 (as
to confidentiality) and 5.4 (as to public disclosures) of this Agreement and
the provisions of Article IX of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and (b) termination shall not preclude either party from suing the
other party for any intentional breach of this Agreement.   

ARTICLE VIII    

 _INDEMNIFICATION_     

Section 8.1 _Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Closing, Seller
shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates (including Parent
and the Companies) harmless from and against and in respect of any and all
actual losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses (hereinafter " _Losses_ ")
incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates or agents arising out of:   

(a) subject to Section 8.4, any breach of Sellers representations and

(b) any breach of Sellers covenants and other agreements in this
Agreement;   

(c) (i) Taxes of the consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes
that includes Seller (the " _Seller Group_ "), and Taxes of the Companies for

are reflected as an accrued Tax liability on the Financial Statements
and have been taken into account in determining the Final Adjustment Amount;
(ii) Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Companies is or was a member on or prior to the Closing
Date by reason of liability under Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or comparable

any tax sharing agreement (whether written or not) to which any of the
Companies was obligated, or was a party, on or prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, Buyers " _Tax Losses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
indemnity provided under this Section 8.1(c) shall not cover Tax liabilities
resulting from any transaction of Buyer or any of its Affiliates not in the
ordinary course of business (other than the transactions
contemplated hereunder) that occurs on the Closing Date but after the
Closing;   

(d) any dispute or claim against, in respect of, or in any manner relating to
any Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, maintained or contributed to
by Seller or any of its Affiliates or any entity that would be considered a
single employer with Seller under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code (other than the Companies) (the " _ERISA Group_ ") solely on account of
the Companies having been, prior to the Closing, a member of the ERISA
Group;    

(e) the Excluded Assets; and   

(f) subject to Section 8.3(d), Enron litigation and Jones Day dispute, in each
case to the extent identified in _Schedule 3.10_ (the " _Retained
Litigation_ "); _provided_  that Losses from such Jones Day dispute shall be
net of receivables payable, if any, to the Companies.   

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Parent and
Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless
from and against and in respect of any and all actual Losses incurred
directly by Seller or its Affiliates or agents arising out of:

any Company Employee at or after the Closing;   

(d) the Companies use of the Bowne Names and Marks in a manner not authorized

(e) Taxes of the Companies (i) for periods or portions thereof beginning after

Buyer and its Affiliates are indemnified by Seller under Section 8.1(c)
(collectively, Sellers " _Tax Losses_ ") and (ii) resulting from any
transaction of Buyer or its Affiliates occurring after the Closing.    

Section 8.3 _Indemnification Procedures._    

(a) Any indemnified party seeking indemnification under this Agreement (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall provide the indemnifying party/ies (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") prompt written notice of any third party claim which
may give rise to any indemnity obligation under this Article VIII, together
with the estimated amount of such claim, if reasonably available, copies of
all correspondence, process, legal pleadings and other relevant
documentation relating thereto, and reference to the provisions of this
Agreement under which liability is asserted.   

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any
such claim through counsel of its own choosing, by so notifying the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Indemnified
Partys written notice. Failure to give prompt notice shall not affect the
indemnification obligations hereunder in the absence of actual prejudice. If
the Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense validly
assumed by the Indemnifying Party, it may do so at its sole cost and expense.
If the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume any such defense, it
shall be liable for all costs and expenses of defending such claim incurred
by the Indemnified Party, including all reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel.   

(c) Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any such claim or demand (i) on a basis which would
result in the imposition of an Order that adversely affects Parent, Buyer or
the Companies, (ii) on a basis which would restrict the future activity
or conduct of, or involve the admission of wrongdoing by, the Companies or
any Affiliate thereof or (iii) if such settlement or compromise does not
include an unconditional release of Buyer and its Affiliates for any
liability arising out of such claim or demand from the applicable third
party. Except as contemplated by Section 8.6(b), neither Parent nor Buyer
shall, without the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any claim or demand for which Seller is the Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement.   

(d) After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, provide
reasonable assistance to Seller as Seller may request (including providing
reasonable access to personnel, properties, books and records) to prosecute,
defend, settle, compromise or otherwise deal with the Retained Litigation.
Seller shall reimburse Buyer and its Affiliates for all actual out-of-
pocket costs incurred by them in fulfilling their obligations under this
Section 8.3(d). Any monetary award, settlement amount or similar payment
received by Buyer or its Affiliates from third parties in connection with the
Enron matter included in the Retained Litigation (other than the
reimbursed expenses of this Section 8.3(d)) shall be promptly delivered to
Seller upon receipt.    

Section 8.4 _Limitations on Liability_    

(a) Sellers liability for any Losses arising from any breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement shall be subject to the
following limitations:   

(i) Sellers representations and warranties in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing, but shall terminate on April 30, 2006 except to the extent that
written notice of any alleged breach thereof has been provided to Seller
prior to such date pursuant to Section 8.3; and   

(ii) Seller shall have no liability for such Losses until the aggregate amount
of such Losses for which Seller is obligated to indemnify pursuant to Section
8.1(a) shall exceed $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), in which case
Seller shall only be liable to the extent that the aggregate of all such
indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Threshold Amount.   

(b) Sellers aggregate liability for all indemnified Losses under Sections
8.1(a) and 8.1(b) of this Agreement shall not exceed 75% of the sum of the
Purchase Price and the Non-Compete Consideration, except that Sellers
aggregate liability for all indemnified Losses pursuant to Section 8.1 shall
not exceed 100% of such sum. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
the limitations of this clause (b) shall not apply to (i) any Taxes of Seller
and its Subsidiaries other than Taxes of, or attributable to, the Companies
and (ii) Section 8.1(d).   

(c) The amount of the Indemnifying Partys liability under this Agreement for
any Loss shall be determined after taking into account any applicable
insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss.
Buyer and Seller shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
any amount available under insurance coverage or from any other
Person responsible for any Losses for which an indemnity claim is being
made.   

(d) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Agreement to multiple
recovery for the same Losses, and the parties agree that the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Agreement shall not apply to any Losses to the
extent such Losses are accounted for in the calculations of the purchase
price adjustment set forth in Section 2.2. Seller shall cooperate with and
assist Buyer and the Companies to recover any reasonable claims resulting
from pre-Closing events or occurrences with respect to the operations of the
Companies under any insurance policy of Seller applicable therefor;
_provided_ that Seller shall have no obligation to incur any cost or expense,
pay any premium or make any other payment to an insurer in connection
therewith unless reimbursed by Buyer therefor. If an Indemnified Party
receives any amount under applicable insurance policy, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to receipt of an
indemnification payment, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse
the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such party
in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the lesser of
(i) the amount received by the Indemnified Party from the other Person in
respect of such Losses, net of any expenses incurred by such party in
collecting such amount, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the total amount
received in respect of such Losses from the other Person and from the
Indemnifying Party over the sum of the total amount of such Losses suffered
by the Indemnified Party and the expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party
in collecting such amounts. Any Losses excluded from the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII due to insurance or
other third party recoveries shall not be considered for purposes of
calculating the deductible threshold set forth in Section 8.4(a).   

(e) All indemnification payments for Losses made pursuant to this Article VIII
shall be made on an after-tax basis. Accordingly, in determining the amount
of any indemnification payment for a Loss suffered or incurred by an
indemnitee hereunder, the amount of such Loss shall be (i) increased to take
into account any additional Tax cost actually incurred by the indemnitee
arising from the receipt of indemnification payments hereunder (" _Tax Costs_
") and (ii) decreased to take into account any deduction, credit or other tax
benefit actually realized by the indemnitee with respect to such Loss (" _Tax
Benefits_ "). In computing the amount of any such Tax Cost or Tax Benefit,
the indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
receipt of any indemnification payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment
of any indemnified Loss; _provided_ , that, if a Tax Cost or Tax Benefit is
not realized in the taxable period during which an indemnifying party makes
an indemnification payment or the indemnitee incurs or pays any Loss, the
parties hereto shall thereafter make payments to one another at the end of
each subsequent taxable period to reflect the net Tax Costs and Tax Benefits
realized by the parties hereto in each such subsequent taxable period. Any
payment made from Seller to Buyer shall, unless otherwise required by Law,
be treated as a reduction in Purchase Price that will not result in any
actual Tax Cost to Buyer for purposes of subsection (i) of this Section
8.4(e).   

(f) The parties agree that under no circumstances will a party be entitled to
any special, consequential, indirect or punitive damages pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement, except to the extent
such damages are awarded or otherwise required to be paid to a third party.
The foregoing shall not, however, limit the ability of the Parent and the
Buyer to recover Damages for the diminution in value of the Companies
associated with any breach of the Sellers representations and warranties
relating to the Companies hereunder to the extent that the laws of New York
would permit a party to recover such damages as a consequence of the
breach.   

(g) Without prejudice to Section 9.7, in the absence of fraud, the
indemnification provided in this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy
for money damages available to the parties for any breach of this Agreement
or in relation to any claim arising out of the Transactions.   

(h) The parties agree that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.    

Section 8.5 _Tax Indemnification Procedures._    

(a) After the Closing, each party to this Agreement (whether Parent/Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be) shall promptly notify the other party in writing
of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of an audit received by
such party from any Governmental Entity or any other Person with respect to
Taxes for which such other party is liable pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or
8.2(e) of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give
such notice will not affect such partys rights to indemnification under this
Article VIII, except to the extent that such other party is actually
prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the
extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies
of the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax
liability.   

(b) Payment by an Indemnifying Party of any amount due to an Indemnified Party
under Section 8.1(c) or 8.2(e) of this Agreement shall be made within ten
(10) days following written notice by the indemnitee that payment of such
amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity or other applicable third
party is due by the indemnitee, _provided_ that the indemnitor shall not
be required to make any payment earlier than five (5) business days before it
is due to the appropriate Governmental Entity or applicable third party. In
the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions of
Section 8.6 of this Agreement, payment of such contested Tax will not be
considered due earlier than the date a "final determination" to such effect is
made by such Governmental Entity. For this purpose, a "final determination"
shall mean a settlement, compromise, or other agreement with the relevant
Governmental Entity, whether contained in an Internal Revenue Service Form
870 or other comparable form, or otherwise, or such procedurally later event,
such as a closing agreement with the relevant Governmental Entity, an
agreement contained in Internal Revenue Service form 870-D or other
comparable form, an agreement that constitutes a "determination" under
Section 1313(a)(4) of the Code, a deficiency notice with respect to which the
period for filing a petition with the Tax Court or the relevant state,
local or foreign tribunal has expired or a decision of any court of competent
jurisdiction that is not subject to appeal or as to which the time for appeal
has expired.    

Section 8.6 _Tax Audits and Contests; Cooperation._    

(a) After the Closing Date, except in the case of any audit, claim for refund,
or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability
or refund with respect to the Companies (any such audit, claim for refund, or
proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability referred to herein as a "
_Contest_ ") relating to a Tax Return of any consolidated, combined or
unitary group of which Seller and the Companies were members, (a " _Pre-
Closing Consolidated Return_ "), and except as provided in (b) and (c) below,
Buyer shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any
Contest.   

(b) In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that relates solely to a
Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, without limitation, any
Pre-Closing Consolidated Returns), Seller shall control the conduct of such
Contest, but Buyer shall have the right to participate in such Contest (or,
in the case of a Contest that relates to a consolidated group Tax Return
of Seller, in any portion of such Contest that relates to any of the
Companies) at its own expense, and Seller shall not be able to settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Contest that is reasonably
likely to affect the Tax liability of any of the Companies for any taxable
year (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without the
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; _provided_ that with respect to any such Contest other than a
Contest that relates solely to a consolidated Tax Return of the Seller Group,
if Seller fails to assume control of the conduct of any such Contest within a
reasonable period following the receipt by Seller of notice of such Contest,
Buyer shall have the right to assume control of such Contest and Buyer shall
be able to settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest in its sole
discretion, unless such Contest involves a matter indemnifiable by Seller, in
which case Buyer shall not settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest
without prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except that if Seller does not provide Buyer with such
written consent within 30 days after Buyer notifies Seller of such
proposed settlement, compromise and/or concession, Buyer shall be able to
settle, compromise and/or concede such Contest without such consent.   

(c) In the case of a Contest that relates to a Straddle Return, Seller shall
control the conduct of such Contest, but Buyer shall have the right to
participate in such Contest at its own expense, and Seller shall not settle,
compromise and/or concede such Contest without the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   

(d) Seller and Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access
to books and records) and assistance relating to the Companies as is
reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and the preparation,
prosecution, defense or conduct of any Contest. Seller and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Contest or other
proceeding involving or otherwise relating to any of the Companies (or their
income or assets) with respect to any Tax and each shall execute and deliver
such powers of attorney and other documents as are reasonably necessary
to carry out the intent of this Section 8.6(d). Any information obtained
under this Section 8.6(d) shall be kept confidential, except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the
conduct of a Contest or other Tax proceeding; _provided_ that the
party providing such information is notified of the circumstances whereby the
information will not be kept confidential.   

(e) Each of Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, (i) use
all commercially reasonable efforts to properly retain and maintain the tax
and accounting records of the Companies that relate to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods until the expiration of the statute of limitations (taking into
account, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof)
and shall thereafter provide the other party with written notice prior to any
destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or any portions of such
records, (ii) transfer such records to the other party upon such partys
written request prior to any such destruction, abandonment or disposition,

TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
