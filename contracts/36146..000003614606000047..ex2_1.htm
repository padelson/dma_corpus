Section  1.1. _Mergers_. Upon  the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the  Company Merger Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A, at the  Effective Time (as defined in Section
7.2 of this Agreement), Republic shall  be  merged with and into Trustmark
(which, as the surviving corporation, is  hereinafter referred to as
"Continuing Corporation" whenever reference is made  to it at or after the
Effective Time) under the Articles of Incorporation of  Trustmark and
pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effect provided in  Sections
79-4-11.01 et seq. of the Mississippi Code of 1972, as  amended.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Immediately  following the Merger and pursuant to this Agreement and the Bank
Merger  Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, Republic Bank
shall be  merged with and into Trustmark National Bank under the Articles of
Association  of Trustmark National Bank. As a result of and as part of the
Bank Merger,  on  the Effective Date (as defined in Exhibit B) of the Bank
Merger each of the  issued and outstanding shares of Republic Bank common
stock shall be cancelled  and retired and shall cease to exist. As a
consequence of the Bank Merger,  all  assets of Republic Bank, as they exist
on the Effective Date, shall pass to  and  vest in Trustmark National Bank
without any conveyance or transfer, and  Trustmark National Bank shall be
responsible for all liabilities of every kind  and description of Republic
Bank as of the Effective Date.

 

 

Section  1.2. _Articles  of Incorporation, Bylaws and Facilities of
Continuing  Corporation_. At  the Effective Time and until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable  law, the Articles of Incorporation of
Continuing Corporation shall be the  Articles of Incorporation of Trustmark
as in effect at the Effective Time.  Until  altered, amended or repealed as
therein provided and in the Articles of  Incorporation of Continuing
Corporation, the Bylaws of Continuing Corporation  shall be the Bylaws of
Trustmark as in effect at the Effective Time. Unless  and  until changed by
the Board of Directors of Continuing Corporation, the main  office of
Continuing Corporation shall be the main office of Trustmark as of  the 
Effective Time. The established offices and facilities of Republic
immediately  prior to the Merger shall become established offices and
facilities of  Continuing Corporation. The Board of Directors of the
Continuing Corporation  shall be the Board of Directors of Trustmark at the
Effective Time, each of  whom  shall serve until duly elected and qualified.
The executive officers of the  Continuing Corporation shall be the executive
officers of Trustmark at the  Effective Time. Until thereafter changed in
accordance with law or the Articles  of Incorporation or Bylaws of Continuing
Corporation, all corporate acts, plans,  policies, contracts, approvals and
authorizations of Republic and Trustmark  and  their respective
shareholders, Boards of Directors, committees elected or  appointed thereby,
officers and agents, which were valid and effective  immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be taken for all purposes as  the  acts, plans,
policies, contracts, approvals and authorizations of Continuing  Corporation
and shall be as effective and binding thereon as the same were  with 
respect to Republic and Trustmark, respectively, as of the Effective  Time.

 

 

Section  1.3. _Effect  of Merger_. At  the Effective Time, the corporate
existence of Republic and Trustmark shall,  as  provided in the provisions
of law heretofore mentioned, be consolidated and  continued in Continuing
Corporation, and Continuing Corporation shall be deemed  to be a continuation
in entity and identity of Republic and Trustmark. All  rights, franchises and
interests of Republic and Trustmark, respectively, in  and  to any type of
property and choses in action shall be transferred to and vested  in
Continuing Corporation by virtue of the Merger without any deed or other 
transfer. Continuing Corporation, without any order or other action on the 
part  of any court or otherwise, shall hold and enjoy all rights of
property,  franchises and interest, including appointments, designations and
nominations,  and all other rights and interests as trustee, executor,
administrator, transfer  agent or registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of
estates, assignee, receiver  and committee of estates and lunatics, and in
every other fiduciary capacity,  in  the same manner and to the same extent
as such rights, franchises, and interests  were held or enjoyed by Republic
and Trustmark, respectively, as of the  Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the directors and officers of Trustmark  shall become the directors and
officers of Continuing Corporation.

Section  1.4. _Liabilities  of Continuing Corporation_. At  the Effective
Time of the Merger, Continuing Corporation shall be liable for  all 
liabilities of Republic and Trustmark. All deposits, debts, liabilities, 
obligations and contracts of Republic and of Trustmark, respectively,
matured  or  unmatured, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise,
and whether  or  not reflected or reserved against on balance sheets, books
of account, or  records of Republic or Trustmark, as the case may be, shall
be those of  Continuing Corporation and shall not be released or impaired by
the Merger.  All  rights of creditors and other obligees and all liens on
property of either  Republic or Trustmark shall be preserved unimpaired
subsequent to the  Merger.

 

 

Section  1.5. _Merger  Consideration_. As  a result of and as part of the
Merger and subject to the adjustments and  limitations provided for in
Sections 1.8 through 1.15 of this Agreement, shares  of Republic Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time, other than
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.7 of this  Agreement), shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder
thereof, be converted into and represent the right to receive cash  or 
shares of common stock, no par value, of Trustmark ("Trustmark Common Stock")
or  combination of both (the "Merger Consideration"), on the basis
described  herein.

 

 

Section  1.6. _Republic  Stock Options_. Republic  shall take all actions
necessary to accelerate vesting of all the outstanding  Republic Stock
options outstanding on the date of this Agreement (which options  are listed
in _Schedule  2.2_ );  provided, however, no Republic Stock options that
were not vested as of February  28, 2006, may become vested until ten (10)
days prior to the Effective Time.  Holders of vested stock options who
exercise them at least three (3) days prior  to the Effective Time shall be
entitled to payment of the Merger Consideration  in accordance with this
Article I. Trustmark shall not assume, or provide any  Merger Consideration
for, a stock option that remains unexercised within three  (3) days of the
Effective Time, or for any Republic Stock acquired by exercising  a stock
option after three (3) days prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

Section  1.7. _Dissenting  Shares_. Each  share of Republic Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time, the holder of which
has not voted in favor of the Merger and  who  has delivered a written
demand for payment of the fair value of such shares  within the time and in
the manner provided in Article 5.12 of the Texas Business  Corporation Act
("TBCA"), is referred to herein as a "Dissenting Share." Dissenting Shares
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive  the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5 of this Agreement and shall  be 
entitled only to such rights as are available to such holder pursuant to the 
applicable provisions of the TBCA unless and until such holder shall have
failed  to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his right to
appraisal  and payment under Article 5.12 of the TBCA. If any such holder
shall have so  failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such right, such  holder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into  and to have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive  the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon.

Section  1.8. _Election  Procedures and Exchange of Shares_. At  least
thirty (30) days prior to the date of the Republic shareholders meeting  to 
approve the Merger (the "Meeting Date"), Republic shall deliver to Trustmark
a  list of Republic's shareholders which shall include each shareholder's
name,  address and the number of shares of Republic Stock owned. Subject to
the  provisions of Sections 1.5, 1.6, and 1.9 through 1.15 hereof, each
holder of  shares of Republic Stock as of the date thirty (30) days prior to
the Meeting  Date (the "Record Date") and the option holders listed in
_Schedule  2.2_   shall be  given the opportunity to elect, in accordance
with the procedures set forth  in  Section 1.10 hereof (the "Election"), to
convert their shares of Republic Stock  into either:

 

 

(a)  cash  in  an amount equal to $44.00 per share for all of the shares of
Republic Stock  owned by such holder of record as of the Record Date (the
"Available Cash  Election"); or

 

 

(b) shares  of  Trustmark Common Stock in an amount equal to the Exchange
Ratio times the number  of shares of Republic Stock owned by such holder of
record as of the Record  Date  (the "Share Election"). The Exchange Ratio
shall be equal to 1.3968; or 

 

 

(c) a  combination of cash and Trustmark Common Stock for all of the shares
of Republic  Stock owned by such holder of record as of the Record Date (the
"Combination  Election") in the proportions and with respect to the shares of
Republic Stock  specified by such holder. In the event a Republic shareholder
makes a  Combination Election, the amount of cash to be received for each
share of  Republic Stock converted into cash shall be computed in accordance
with Section  1.8(a) and the amount of Trustmark Common Stock to be received
for shares of  Republic Stock converted in Trustmark Common Stock shall be
computed in  accordance with Section 1.8(b).

 

 

The  elections made by the option holders shall only be binding on those
option  holders (i) if the Merger is approved by the Republic shareholders
and (ii)  the  option holder exercises the option for the shares of Republic
Stock at least  three (3) days prior to the Effective Time as provided in
Section  1.6.

 

 

Section  1.9. _Limitation  on Elections_. If,  based on the Elections, the
total cash payable to holders of Republic Stock  (including cash payable in
lieu of fractional shares and cash payable to  dissenters to the Merger)
would be greater than forty-nine percent (49%) of  the  total value of the
Merger Consideration, or the total Trustmark Common Stock  issued to holders
of Republic Stock would be greater than fifty-one percent  (51%) of the total
value of the Merger Consideration, Trustmark shall have  the  right to
proportionally adjust the cash and Trustmark Common Stock to be issued  to
holders of Republic Stock so that the total cash payable to holders of 
Republic Stock (including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and cash 
payable to dissenters to the Merger) shall be equal to forty-nine percent
(49%)  of the Merger Consideration and the total Trustmark Common Stock to be
issued  shall be equal to fifty-one percent (51%) of the Merger Consideration
or  3,400,000 shares. For purposes of the calculation contained herein, all 
dissenting shareholders shall be deemed to have received cash in an amount 
equal  to the amount of the Available Cash Election for such shares.

Section  1.10. _Form  of Election_. Forms  for making the Election (the
"Forms  of  Election"),  shall  be mailed to the option holders and
holders of Republic Stock as of the Record  Date as part of the proxy
statement (the "Proxy  Statement")  for the  special shareholders\' 
meeting  of Republic called to consider the Merger. The Forms of Election
must be  properly completed and returned to Republic on or before the Meeting
Date in  accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. Any option
holder or holder  of shares of Republic Stock who does not return a properly
executed Form of  Election on or before the Meeting Date shall be deemed to
have made a Share  Election. If the Merger is approved, Republic shall
furnish Trustmark with  the  original Forms of Election as soon as is
practicable following the  shareholders\'  meeting  of Republic.

 



 

Section  1.11. _Change  in Election; Revocation_. Any  option holder or
holder of Republic Stock may, at any time, change an Election  by submitting

(a) Promptly  following the Effective Time of the Merger, Trustmark shall
send to holders  of  Republic Stock of record as of the Closing Date
transmittal materials for use  in  exchanging their shares of Republic Stock
for the Merger Consideration.  Trustmark shall thereafter promptly pay the
Merger Consideration to holders  of  Republic Stock who have properly
submitted transmittal materials and surrendered  their share certificates to
Trustmark. Unless and until the share certificates  are properly surrendered,
a former holder of Republic Stock shall not be  entitled to receive the cash
and/or share certificates to which such holder  is  entitled or any
dividends payable with respect to such shares. Upon the proper  surrender of
such Republic Stock, the former Republic shareholder shall be  issued the
Trustmark shares and/or shall be paid the cash and dividends (without 
interest) to which such shareholder is entitled.

 



 

(b) Former  shareholders of Republic who have made a Share Election or
Combination Election  shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at
any meeting of Trustmark's  shareholders the number of shares of Trustmark
Common Stock into which their  shares are converted, after such shareholders
of Republic have surrendered  their  certificates in exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) After  the  Effective Time, the stock transfer ledger of Republic shall
be closed and there  shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
Republic of the shares  of  Republic Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to such time. If, after  the Effective Time, certificates
are presented to Trustmark, they shall be  promptly exchanged as provided in
this Section 1.12.

 

 

(d) If  any  certificate representing shares of Trustmark Common Stock is to
be issued in  a  name other than that in which the certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor  is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the  certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed
(or accompanied  by an  appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form (reasonably  satisfactory to Trustmark) for transfer, and that
the person requesting such  exchange shall pay to Trustmark in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required  by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Trustmark  Common Stock in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the  certificate surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish  to  the satisfaction of Trustmark that
such tax has been paid or not  payable.

former holder  of  shares of Republic Stock for any Trustmark Common Stock
(or dividends or  distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly
delivered to a public  official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar  laws.

 

 

Section  1.13. _Fractional  Shares_. No  fractional shares of Trustmark
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender  for exchange of certificates
representing shares of Republic Stock. In lieu  of  any such fractional
share, each holder of shares of Republic Stock who would  otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of Trustmark Common Stock will  be  paid cash
upon the proper surrender of all the stock certificates representing  shares
of Republic Stock held by such holder in the amount equal to the product  of
such fraction multiplied by $31.50.

 



 

Section  1.14. _Calculations  and Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) If,  between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, shares of
Trustmark  Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or
shares of  a  different class by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock  split, or stock dividend with a record date within
said period, the number  of  shares of Trustmark Common Stock to be issued
and delivered upon the  consummation of the Merger as provided in this
Agreement shall be appropriately  and proportionately adjusted so that the
number of such shares that will be  issued and delivered as a result of the
Merger will equal the number of shares  of Trustmark Common Stock that
holders of shares of Republic Stock would have  received had the record date
for such reclassification, recapitalization, stock  split, or stock dividend
been immediately following the Effective  Time.

 



 

(b) If,  between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
number of shares  of Republic Stock issued shall be increased due to the
purchase of shares by  Republic's employee stock purchase plan, the Exchange
Ratio, the Available Cash  Election share price, the Merger Consideration to
be delivered pursuant to  this  Agreement, and any other relevant provision
of this Agreement shall be adjusted  to reflect all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Republic Stock at the  Effective Time.

 



 

Section  1.15. _Lost  or Destroyed Certificates_. Any  person whose
certificates representing shares of Republic Stock shall have  been  lost or
destroyed may nevertheless obtain the shares of Trustmark Common Stock 
and/or cash to which such holder of Republic Stock is entitled as a result 
of  the Merger if such holder provides Trustmark with a statement certifying
such  loss or destruction and an indemnity satisfactory to Trustmark
sufficient to  indemnify Trustmark against any loss or expense that may occur
as a result  of  such lost or destroyed certificate being thereafter
presented to Trustmark  for  exchange.

Section  1.16. _Ratification  by Shareholders_. This  Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of Republic in accordance  with  applicable
provisions of law and the respective Articles of Incorporation and  Bylaws of
Republic. Republic and Trustmark shall proceed expeditiously and  cooperate
fully in the procurement of any other consents and approvals and  the 
taking of any other actions in satisfaction of all other requirements
prescribed  by law or otherwise necessary for consummation of the Merger on
the terms herein  provided, including, without limitation, the preparation
and submission of  all  necessary filings, requests for waivers and
certificates with the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System
("Federal Reserve Board") and the Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency
("OCC").

 

 

Section  1.17. _Tax  Consequences_. It  is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall constitute a  reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and the parties  hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of  Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated  thereunder.

admission by either party that  such  item was required to be disclosed
therein. Republic agrees that, two (2) days  prior to Closing, it shall

respects the binding obligations of the respective  obligors named therein in
accordance with their respective terms, (b) the  allowance for loan losses
shown on the Republic Financial Statements as of  and  for the period ended
December 31, 2005, was, and the allowance for loan losses  to be shown on the
Republic Financial Statements as of any date subsequent  to  the execution
of this Agreement will be, as of such dates, in the reasonable  judgment of
management of Republic, adequate to provide for possible losses,  net  of
recoveries relating to loans previously charged off, in respect of loans 
outstanding (including accrued interest receivable) of Republic and other 
extensions of credit (including letters of credit or commitments to make
loans  or extend credit), and (c) the allowance for loan losses described in
clause  (b)  above has been established in accordance with GAAP as applied
to banking  institutions and all applicable rules and regulations; provided,
however, that  Republic makes no representation or warranty as to the
sufficiency of collateral  securing or the collectibility of such loans.

 

 

Section  2.7. _Certain  Loans and Related Matters_.

 

 

(a) Except  as  set forth in _Schedule  2.7(a)_ ,  Republic is not a party
to any written or oral: (i) loan agreement,  note or borrowing arrangement
under the terms of which the obligor is sixty  (60)  days delinquent in
payment of principal or interest or in default of any other  material
provisions as of the date hereof; (ii) loan agreement, note or  borrowing
arrangement which has been classified or, in the exercise of  reasonable
diligence by Republic, should have been classified as
"substandard," "doubtful," "loss," "other loans especially mentioned," "other
assets especially  mentioned" or any comparable classifications by such
persons; (iii) loan  agreement, note or borrowing arrangement, including any
loan guaranty, with  any  director or executive officer of Republic, or any
10% or more shareholder of  Republic, or any person, corporation or
enterprise controlling, controlled  by or  under common control with any of
the foregoing; or (iv) loan agreement, note  or  borrowing arrangement in
violation of any law, regulation or rule applicable  to  Republic including,
but not limited to, those promulgated, interpreted or  enforced by any
regulatory agency with supervisory jurisdiction over Republic  and which
violation could have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of  Republic.

 

 

(b) _Schedule  2.7(b)_   contains  the "watch list of loans" of Republic
(the "Watch List") as of December 31,  2005. Except as set forth in
_Schedule  2.7(b)_ ,  to the  knowledge of Republic, there is no loan
agreement, note or borrowing arrangement  which should be included on the
Watch List in accordance with Republic's current  practices and prudent
banking principles.

 

 

Section  2.8. _Real  Property Owned or Leased_.

 

 

(a) Other  than real property acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure,  _Schedule  2.8(a)_   contains  a true, correct and complete
list of all real property owned or leased by  Republic (the "Republic Real
Property"). True and complete copies of all deeds,  leases and title
insurance policies for, or other documentation evidencing  ownership of, the
properties referred to in _Schedule  2.8(a)_   and all  mortgages, deeds of
trust and security agreements to which such property is  subject have been
furnished or made available to Trustmark.

(b) No  lease  with respect to any Republic Real Property and no deed with
respect to any  Republic Real Property contains any restrictive covenant that
materially  restricts the use, transferability or value of such Republic Real
Property.  Each  of such leases is a legal, valid and binding obligation
enforceable in  accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency,  moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors  generally and the availability of equitable
remedies), and is in full force  and  effect; there are no existing defaults
by Republic or the other party thereunder  and there are no allegations or
assertions of such by any party under such  agreement or any events that with
notice, lapse of time, or the happening or  occurrence of any other event
would constitute a default  thereunder.

 

 

(c) To  the  knowledge of Republic, none of the buildings and structures
located on any  Republic Real Property, nor any appurtenances thereto or
equipment therein,  nor  the operation or maintenance thereof, violates in
any material manner any  restrictive covenants or encroaches on any property
owned by others, nor does  any building or structure of third parties
encroach upon any Republic Real  Property, except for those violations and
encroachments which in the aggregate  could not reasonably be expected to
cause a Material Adverse Effect on the  Condition of Republic. No
condemnation proceeding is pending or, to Republic's  knowledge, threatened,
which would preclude or materially impair the use of  any  Republic Real
Property in the manner in which it is currently being  used.

 

 

(d) Republic  has good and indefeasible title to, or a valid and enforceable
leasehold  interest in, or a contract vendee's interest in, all Republic Real
Property, and  such interest is free and clear of all liens, charges or other
encumbrances,  except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or
which are being  contested in good faith through proper proceedings, and (ii)
those liens related  to real property Taxes, local improvement district
assessments, easements,  covenants, restrictions and other matters of record
which do not individually  or  in the aggregate materially adversely affect
the use and enjoyment of the  relevant real property.

 

 

(e) Except  as  set forth in _Schedule  2.8(e)_ ,  all  buildings and
other facilities used in the business of Republic are adequately  maintained
and, to Republic's knowledge, are free from defects which could  materially
interfere with the current or future use of such  facilities.

 

 

Section  2.9. _Personal  Property_. Republic  has good title to, or a
valid leasehold interest in, all personal property,  whether tangible or
intangible, used in the conduct of its business (the "Republic Personalty"),
free and clear of all liens, charges or other  encumbrances, except (a)
statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or  which  are being
contested in good faith through proper proceedings, and (b) such  other 
liens, charges, encumbrances and imperfections of title as do not
individually  or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the use and
enjoyment of the  relevant Republic Personalty. Subject to ordinary wear and
tear, the Republic  Personalty is in good operating condition and repair and
is adequate for the  uses to which it is being put.

Section  2.10. _Environmental  Laws_. To  the knowledge of Republic,
Republic and any properties or business owned or  operated by Republic,
whether or not held in a fiduciary or representative  capacity, are in
material compliance with all terms and conditions of all  applicable federal
and state Environmental Laws (as defined below) and permits  thereunder.
Republic has not received notice of any violation of any  Environmental Laws
or generated, stored, or disposed of any materials designated  as Hazardous
Materials (as defined below) under the Environmental Laws, and  they  are
not subject to any claim or lien under any Environmental Laws. During the 
term of ownership by Republic no real estate currently owned, operated, or 
leased (including any property acquired by foreclosure or deeded in lieu 
thereof) by Republic, or owned, operated or leased by Republic within the
ten  years preceding the date of this Agreement, has been designated by
applicable  governmental authorities as requiring any environmental cleanup
or response  action to comply with Environmental Laws, or has been the site
of release of  any  Hazardous Materials. To the knowledge of Republic, (a)
no asbestos was used  in  the construction of any portion of Republic's
facilities, and (b) no real  property currently owned by it is, or has been,
an industrial site or landfill.  Trustmark and its consultants, agents and
representatives shall have the right  to inspect Republic's assets for the
purpose of conducting asbestos and other  environmental surveys, provided
that such inspection shall be at the expense  of  Trustmark and at such time
as may be mutually agreed upon between Republic  and  Trustmark.

federal, state or local  statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code,
policy or rule of common law  now in effect and in each case as amended to
date, and any judicial or  administrative interpretation thereof, including

to the environment, human health  or  safety, or Hazardous Materials,
including without limitation the Comprehensive  Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,  42  U.S.C. § 9601,

;  the  Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7401, _et  seq._ ;  and the  Safe
Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. § 300f, _et  seq._

limited to,  (a) any petroleum or petroleum products, natural gas, or natural
gas  products, radioactive materials, asbestos, urea formaldehyde foam
insulation,  transformers or other equipment that contains dielectric fluid
containing levels  of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mold, and radon gas;
(b) any  chemicals, materials, waste or substances defined as or included in
the  definition of "hazardous substances," "hazardous wastes," "hazardous
materials," "extremely hazardous wastes," "restricted hazardous wastes,"
"toxic substances," "toxic pollutants," "contaminants," or "pollutants," or
words of similar import,  under any Environmental Laws; and (c) any other

agency or instrumentality, including  mixtures thereof with other materials,
and including any regulated building  materials such as asbestos and lead.

Section  2.11. _Litigation  and Other Proceedings_. Except  as set forth in
_Schedule  2.11_ ,  there  are no legal, quasi-judicial, regulatory or
administrative proceedings of any  kind or nature now pending or, to the
knowledge of Republic, threatened before  any court or administrative body in
any manner against Republic, or any of  its  properties or capital stock,
which might have a Material Adverse Effect on  the  Condition of Republic or
the transactions proposed by this Agreement. Republic  does not know of any
basis on which any litigation or proceeding could be  brought which could
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of Republic  or which could
question the validity of any action taken or to be taken in  connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  Republic is not in
default with respect to any judgment, order, writ,  injunction, decree,
award, rule or regulation of any court, arbitrator or  governmental agency or
instrumentality.

 

 

Section  2.12. _Taxes_. Republic  has filed with the appropriate federal,
state and local governmental agencies  all Tax Returns and reports required
to be filed, and has paid all Taxes and  assessments shown or claimed to be
due. The Tax Returns as filed were correct  in  all respects. Republic has
not executed or filed with the Internal Revenue  Service any agreement
extending the period for assessment and collection of  any  federal income
Tax. Republic is not a party to any action or proceeding by  any 
governmental authority for assessment or collection of Taxes, nor has any
claim  for assessment or collection of Taxes been asserted against Republic.
Republic  has not waived any statute of limitations with respect to any Tax
or other  assessment or levy, and all such Taxes and other assessments and
levies which  Republic is required by law to withhold or to collect have been
duly withheld  and collected and have been paid over to the proper
governmental authorities  to  the extent due and payable, or segregated and
set aside for such payment and,  if  so segregated and set aside will be so
paid by Republic, as required by  law.

 

 

True  and  complete copies of the federal income tax returns of Republic as
filed with  the  Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the years ended
December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002 have been delivered or made available to
Trustmark.

limitation any collective  bargaining contract or union agreement or
agreement with an independent  consultant) which is not terminable by
Republic on less than sixty (60)  days' notice without payment of any amount
on account of such termination;

(b) Republic  has in all material respects performed all material obligations
required to  be  performed by it to date and is not in default under, and no
event has occurred  which, with the lapse of time or action by a third party

policies owned or held by or on behalf  of Republic (other than credit-life
policies), including policy numbers,  retention levels, insurance carriers,

Such  policies are in full force and effect and contain only standard
cancellation  or  termination clauses. In the judgment of the Board of
Directors of Republic,  such  insurance policies in respect of amounts,
types and risks insured are adequate  to insure against risks to which
Republic and its assets are normally exposed  in  the operation of its
business, subject to customary deductibles and policy  limits.

delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation  of  the

provision of Republic's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or  (b) assuming
all required shareholder and regulatory approvals and consents  are duly
obtained, will not (i) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, 
regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to
Republic  or any of its properties or assets, or (ii) violate, conflict with,
result  in a  breach of any provision of or constitute a default (or an
event which, with  or  without notice or lapse of time, would constitute a
default) under, result  in  the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate  the performance required by, cause Trustmark
or Republic to become subject  to or  liable for the payment of any Tax, or

properties or assets of Republic under, any  of  the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,  deed  of trust, license,
lease agreement, instrument or obligation to which Republic  is a party, or
by which any of its properties or assets may be bound or  affected, except
for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which  either
individually or in the aggregate will not have a Material Adverse Effect  on
the Condition of Republic.

is in material compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, 
rules, regulations and orders applicable to it. Except for approvals by 
regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over Republic, no prior consent, 
approval or authorization of, or declaration, filing or registration with, 
any  person or regulatory authority is required of Republic in connection
with the  execution, delivery and performance by Republic of this Agreement
and the  transactions contemplated hereby, or the resulting change of control
of Republic  except for certain instruments necessary to consummate the
Merger contemplated  hereby. Republic has filed all reports, registrations
and statements, together  with any amendments required to be made thereto,
that are required to be filed  with the Federal Reserve Board or any other
regulatory authority having  jurisdiction over Republic and its Subsidiaries,

Republic, true and correct in all  material respects.

encumbrance or paid any obligation  or liability (fixed or contingent), other

Condition of Republic which has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a

limitation  any  change in the administrative or supervisory standing or
rating of Republic  with  any regulatory agency having jurisdiction over
Republic, and no fact or  condition exists as of the date hereof which might
reasonably be expected to  cause any such event or change in the future.

 

 

Section  2.18. _Employment  Relations_. The  relations of Republic with its
employees are satisfactory, and Republic has  not  received any notice of
any controversies with, or organizational efforts or  other pending actions
by, representatives of its employees. Republic has  materially complied with

Republic, including without limitation any employee  benefit plan within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employment  Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), any employee  pension benefit plan within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, or any  collective bargaining, bonus,

and the applicable provisions  of the Code.

 

 

(b) No  employee benefit plans of Republic or its ERISA Affiliates (as
defined below)  (the "Republic Plans") are subject to Title IV of ERISA or
are "multiemployer  plans" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
("Multiemployer  Plans"). None of Republic or any of its respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any  time during the last six years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute  to any Multiemployer Plan, and none of
Republic, or any of its respective ERISA  Affiliates has incurred any
withdrawal liability under Part I of  Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA that

transaction," as  defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code, has occurred that  could result in liability to Republic and its
Subsidiaries. Republic's 401(k)  Plan has been determined to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a)  of the Code and neither Republic or its

status of such plan. Republic has provided  Trustmark with copies of the most

"Controlled Group  Liability" means (i) any and all liabilities (A) under
Title IV  of ERISA, (B) under Section 302 of ERISA, (C) under  Sections 412
and 4971 of the Code, or (D) as a result of a failure to  comply with the
continuation coverage requirements of Section 601  _et  seq._   of ERISA 
and Section 4980B of the Code, and (E) under corresponding or similar 
provisions of foreign laws or regulations; (ii) with respect to any  Republic
Plan any other material liability under Title I of ERISA or  Chapter 43 or 68
of the Code, and (iii) material unfunded liabilities  under any non-qualified
deferred compensation plan for the benefit of any  employee or former
employee of Republic.

 

 

(e) "ERISA  Affiliates" means, with respect to any entity, trade or business,
any other  entity, trade or business that is a member of a group described
in  Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of 
ERISA that includes the first entity, trade or business, or that is a member 
of  the same "controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business
pursuant to  Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

Trustmark  has filed all material reports and statements, together with any
amendments  required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to

reports and statements (or if  amended, as of the date so amended), were true
and correct and complied in  all  material respects with the relevant
statutes, rules and regulations enforced  or  promulgated by the SEC, and
such reports did not contain any untrue statement  of  a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make  the  statements

Section  3.7. _Trustmark  Employee Benefit Plans_. The  employee benefits
plans and welfare benefit plans (referred to collectively  herein as the
"Trustmark Plans") in effect at Trustmark and its Subsidiaries  have all been
operated in all material respects in compliance with ERISA, since  ERISA
became applicable with respect thereto. None of the Trustmark Plans nor  any
of their respective related trusts have been terminated (except the 
termination of any Trustmark Plan which is in compliance with the
requirements  of ERISA and which will not result in any additional liability
to Trustmark),  and there has been no "reportable event," as that term is
defined in Section  4043 of ERISA, required to be reported since the
effective date of ERISA which  has not been reported, and none of such
Trustmark Plans nor their respective  related trusts have incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency," as such term  is defined in Section 302 of
ERISA (whether or not waived), since the effective  date of ERISA. The
Trustmark Plans are the only employee benefit plans covering  employees of
Trustmark and its Subsidiaries. Trustmark and its Subsidiaries  will  not
have any material liabilities with respect to employee benefits, whether 
vested or unvested as of the Closing Date, for any of their employees other 
than  under the Trustmark Plans, and as of the date hereof the actuarial
present  value  of Trustmark Plan assets of each Trustmark Plan is not less
(and as of the  Effective Time of the Merger such present value will not be
less) than the  present value of all benefits payable or to be payable
thereunder.

 

 

Section  3.8. _Regulatory  Approvals_. Trustmark  has no reason to believe
that it will not be able to obtain all requisite  regulatory approvals
necessary to consummate the transactions set forth in  this  Agreement
without unnecessary delay.

 

 

Section  3.9. _Taxes_. Trustmark  and its Subsidiaries have filed with the
appropriate federal, state and local  governmental authorities all material
Tax Returns and reports required to be  filed, and have paid all Taxes and
assessments shown to be due and payable  thereon. At the time of filing, all
such Tax Returns were correct in all  material respects. Neither Trustmark
nor any of its Subsidiaries have executed  or filed with the Internal Revenue
Service any agreement extending the period  for assessment and collection of
any federal income Tax. Neither Trustmark  nor  any Subsidiary is a party to
any pending action or proceeding by any  governmental authority for
assessment or collection of Taxes, nor has any  written claim for assessment
or collection of Taxes been asserted against  Trustmark or any Subsidiary.
All Taxes which Trustmark or any Subsidiary is  or  was required by law to
withhold or to collect have been duly withheld and  collected and have been
paid over to the proper authorities to the extent due  and payable, or
segregated and set aside for such payment and, if so segregated  and set
aside will be so paid by Trustmark or any Subsidiary, as required by 
applicable law.

 

 

Section  3.10. _Insurance_. Trustmark  currently maintains insurance in
amounts reasonably necessary for its  operations. In the judgment of the
Board of Directors of Trustmark, such  insurance policies in respect of
amounts, types and risks insured are adequate  to insure against risks to
which Trustmark and its assets are normally exposed  in the operation of its
business, subject to customary deductibles and policy  limits. Trustmark has
no reason to believe that existing insurance coverage  cannot be renewed as
and when the same shall expire upon terms and conditions  as  favorable as
those presently in effect, other than possible increases in  premiums or
unavailability of coverage that do not result from any extraordinary  loss
experience on the part of Trustmark.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-23-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  3.11. _Laws  and Regulatory Filings_. Trustmark  and its
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable federal,  state
and local laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to them, except 
where such noncompliance would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on 
Trustmark. Except for approvals by regulatory authorities having supervisory 
jurisdiction over Trustmark and its Subsidiaries, no prior consent, approval 
or  authorization of, or declaration, filing or registrations with, any
person  or  regulatory authority is required of Trustmark and its
Subsidiaries in connection  with the execution, delivery and performance by
Trustmark of this Agreement  and  the transactions contemplated hereby.
Trustmark and its Subsidiaries have filed  all reports, registrations and
statements, together with any amendments required  to be made thereto, that
are required to be filed with the Federal Reserve  Board, the FDIC, the OCC,
or any other regulatory authority having supervisory  jurisdiction over
Trustmark and its Subsidiaries, and such reports,  registrations and
statements, as finally amended or corrected, are, to the  knowledge of
Trustmark and its Subsidiaries, true and correct in all material  respects.

 

 

Section  3.12. _Community  Reinvestment Act_. Trustmark  National Bank is
in material compliance with the CRA and all regulations  promulgated
thereunder. Trustmark National Bank has a rating of "satisfactory" as of its
most recent CRA compliance examination and, knows of no reason why  it 
would not receive a rating of "satisfactory" or better pursuant to its next
CRA  compliance examination or why the OCC or any other governmental entity
may  seek  to restrain, delay or prohibit the transactions contemplated
hereby as a result  of any act or omission of the Trustmark National Bank
under the  CRA.

 

 

Section  3.13. _Litigation  and Other Proceedings_. There  are no legal,
quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings of any kind or nature  now
pending or, to the knowledge of Trustmark, threatened before any court  or 
administrative body in any manner against Trustmark, or any of its
properties  or  capital stock, which might have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Condition  of  Trustmark or the transactions proposed by this Agreement.
Trustmark knows of  no  basis on which any litigation or proceeding could be
brought which could have  a  Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of
Trustmark or which could question  the validity of any action taken or to be
taken in connection with this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Trustmark is not in default  with respect to any judgment, order,
writ, injunction, decree, award, rule  or  regulation of any court,
arbitrator or governmental agency or  instrumentality.

 

 

Section  3.14. _Brokers  and Finders_. Other  than as set forth on
_Schedule  3.14_ ,  neither  Trustmark nor any of its officers, directors
or employees have employed any  broker or finder or incurred any liability
for any brokerage fees, commissions  or finders' fees in connection with this
Agreement.

 

 

Section  3.15. _Sarbanes-Oxley  Act Compliance_. Trustmark  and its
Subsidiaries and any of the officers and directors of Trustmark, in  their
capacities as such, are in compliance, in all material respects, with  the 
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the 
related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC and  NASDAQ.

 

 

Section  3.16. _Absence  of Certain Changes_. Since  December 31, 2005, (a)
Trustmark and its Subsidiaries have conducted their  respective businesses in
the ordinary and usual course consistent with prudent  banking practices
(excluding the incurrence of expenses related to this  Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby), and (b) no event has  occurred or
circumstance arisen that, individually or in the aggregate, has  had  or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on  Trustmark.

Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined); nor will they enter into 
any  negotiations concerning, furnish any nonpublic information relating to
Republic  in connection with, or agree to any Acquisition Proposal; except
where the  Board  of Directors of Republic determines, based on the written
advice of counsel,  that the failure to furnish such information or

related Guarantee Agreement) exists or is continuing; (b) no  Default or
Event of Default will occur as a result of the execution, delivery  and

Section  5.1. _Regulatory  Filings and Best Efforts_. Trustmark  will take
all reasonable action to aid and assist in the consummation of the  Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and will use its best efforts  to
take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or advisable 
to  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
such  actions which are necessary, proper or advisable in connection with
filing  applications with, or obtaining approvals from, all regulatory
authorities  having jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.

 

 

Section  5.2. _Registration  Statement_. Within  thirty (30) days after the

Registration Statement on Form S-4 under the Securities  Act and any other
applicable documents, relating to the shares of Trustmark  Common Stock to be
delivered to the shareholders of Republic pursuant to this  Agreement, and
will use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement  to  become
effective. Republic and its counsel shall be given the opportunity to 
participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement and shall have 
the  right to approve the content of the Registration Statement with respect
to  Republic and the Republic shareholders meeting. At the time the
Registration  Statement becomes effective, the Registration Statement will
comply in all  material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act
and the published  rules and regulations thereunder, and will not contain any
untrue statement  of a  material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein  or  necessary to make the statements therein

Statement (the "Proxy Statement"), as  amended or supplemented by any
amendment or supplement filed by Trustmark will  not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any  material fact necessary to
make the statements therein not false or misleading;  provided, however, that
none of the provisions of this subparagraph shall apply  to statements in or
omissions from the Registration Statement or the Proxy  Statement made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished  by  Republic for

Section  5.3. _Employee  Benefit Plans_. Trustmark  agrees that the
employees of Republic who continue their employment after the  Closing Date
(the "Republic Employees") will be entitled to participate as newly  hired
employees in the employee benefit plans and programs maintained for 
employees of Trustmark on the Closing Date, in accordance with the
respective  terms of such plans and programs, and Trustmark shall take all
actions necessary  or appropriate to facilitate coverage of the Republic
Employees in such plans  and programs from and after the Closing Date,
subject to the  following:

 

 

(a) Each  Republic Employee will be entitled to credit for prior service with
Republic  for  all purposes under the employee benefit plans and other
employee benefit plans  and programs (other than stock option plans),
sponsored by Trustmark to the  extent Republic sponsored a similar type of
plan in which the Republic Employees  participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Any eligibility waiting  period and pre-existing condition
exclusion applicable to such plans and  programs shall be waived with respect
to each Republic Employee and their  eligible dependents. For purposes of
determining Republic Employees benefit  for  the calendar year in which the
Merger occurs under Trustmark's vacation program,  any vacation taken by the
Republic Employees immediately preceding the Closing  Date for the calendar
year in which the Merger occurs will be deducted from  the  total Trustmark
vacation benefit available to such Republic Employees for such  calendar
year. Trustmark further agrees to credit the Republic Employees and  their
eligible dependents for the year during which coverage under Trustmark's 
group health plan begins, with any deductibles already incurred during such 
year, under Republic's group health plan.

 

 

(b) The  Republic Employees shall be entitled to credit for past service with
Republic  for the purpose of satisfying any eligibility or vesting periods
applicable  to  Trustmark's employee benefit plans which are subject to
Sections 401(a) and  501(a) of the Code (including, without limitation,
Trustmark's 401(k) Profit  Sharing Plan).

 

 

(c) Republic  shall be entitled to accrue on its balance sheet for employee
bonuses for  performance in the 2006 calendar year in which the Merger
occurs. The amount  accrued shall be consistent with Republic's past
practices and in the normal  course of business. The accrued bonuses shall be
payable in accordance with  Trustmark's incentive compensation plan to
eligible employees on March 15, 2007,  provided the eligible employee is
employed by Trustmark on March 1,  2007.

 

 

Section  5.4. _Regulatory  Approvals_. Trustmark  will file all necessary
regulatory documents, notices and applications not  later  than the 30th day
after the execution of this Agreement and will provide  Republic with a copy
of the non-confidential portions of notices, applications,  statements or
correspondence submitted to or received from regulatory  authorities in
connection with the Merger.

 

 

Section  5.5. _NASDAQ  Listing_. Trustmark  will file all documents
required to have the shares of Trustmark Common Stock  to  be issued

applicable for affiliates of Republic within the  meaning of Rule 144 to sell
shares of Trustmark Common Stock in accordance  with  Rule 145 of the
Securities Act), Trustmark shall use its best efforts to file  in  a timely
manner all reports with the SEC required to be filed by it pursuant  to

Section  5.7. _Indemnification;  Insurance_. 

 

 

(a) For  a  period of four (4) years from and after the Effective Time,
Trustmark (the  "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former  director, officer and employee of Republic determined as
of the Effective Time  (the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable  attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities  (collectively, "Costs") incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation whether
civil or criminal, administrative or  investigative, arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to  the  Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective  Time to the fullest extent to
which such Indemnified Parties were entitled  under  Republic's Articles of
Association, Bylaws and applicable laws.

 

 

(b) Any  Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
section, upon  learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall  promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall  not  relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it
may have to such Indemnified  Party if such failure does not materially
prejudice the Indemnifying Party.  In  the event of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether  arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall  have the right to assume
the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall  not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other  counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties  in connection
with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party  elects not
to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party and  the 
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is 
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying
Party  shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are received, the
reasonable fees  and  expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
(which may not exceed  one  firm in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified  Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest), (ii) the  Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, and (iii)  the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without  its prior written consent.

 

 

(c) Trustmark  shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain its
existing policy  of  directors and officers liability insurance (or
comparable coverage) for a period  of not less than four (4) years after the
Effective Time; which policy shall  be  amended, however, to include the
directors and officers of Republic currently  covered under the policy held
by Republic, and which shall be a "claims made" policy providing coverage for
(among other things) acts or omissions occurring  prior to the Effective
Time.

of the covenants of Republic under the  Indenture.

 

 

Section  5.9. _Trustmark  National Bank Director_. Trustmark  agrees that
at or prior to the Effective Time it will elect C. P. Bryan to  the  Board
of Directors of Trustmark National Bank, such election to be effective  as

failure by  it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any

directly or indirectly, before or after the  consummation or termination of
this Agreement, disclose any confidential  information, whether written or
oral ("Subject Information") acquired from the  other party to any person,
firm, corporation, association or other entity for  any reason or purpose
whatsoever, other than in connection with the regulatory  notice and
application process or, after termination of this Agreement pursuant  to
Section 8.1 hereof, use such Subject Information for its own purposes or  for
the benefit of any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity

information that (a) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally 
available to and known to the public, other than by a breach of this

in order to determine  whether any condition exists which would permit the
parties hereto to terminate  this Agreement. If no such condition then exists
or if no party elects to  exercise any right it may have to terminate this
Agreement, then and thereupon  the appropriate parties shall execute such
documents and instruments as may  be  necessary or appropriate to effect the

Section  8.1. _Termination_.

 

 

(a) This  Agreement may be terminated by action of the Board of Directors of
Trustmark  or  Republic at any time prior to the Effective Time if:

 

 

(i)  any  court  of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other
United States (federal  or state) governmental body shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or  taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the  Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have been final  and  non-appealable;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-33-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) any  of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
disapproved by any  regulatory authority or other person whose approval is
required to consummate  any of such transactions; or

 

 

(iii) the  Merger shall not have become effective on or before the one
hundred and fiftieth  day following the date of this Agreement, or such later
date as shall have  been  approved in writing by the Boards of Directors of
Trustmark and Republic;  provided, however, that the right to terminate under
this  Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to  fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been the cause
of,  or  has resulted in, the failure of the Merger to become effective on
or before  such  date.

 

 

(b) This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by the
Board of  Directors of Republic if (i) Trustmark shall fail to comply in any
material  respect with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement,  or  if any of the representations or warranties of Trustmark
contained herein shall  be inaccurate in any material respect, or (ii) if the
conditions set forth  in  Article X have not been met or waived by Republic.
In the event the Board of  Directors of Republic desires to terminate this
Agreement because of an alleged  breach or inaccuracy or change as provided
in (i) above, such Board of  Directors must notify Trustmark in writing of
its intent to terminate stating  the reason therefor. Trustmark shall have
fifteen (15) days from the  receipt of such notice to cure the alleged breach
or inaccuracy, subject to  the  approval of Republic (which approval shall
not be unreasonably  withheld).

 

 

(c) This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
action of the  Board of Directors of Trustmark if (i) Republic shall fail to
comply in any  material respect with any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this  Agreement, or if any of the representations or warranties
of Republic contained  herein shall be inaccurate in any material respect,
(ii) if the conditions  set  forth in Article IX have not been met or waived
by Trustmark, or (iii) the  Board of Directors of Trustmark reasonably
concludes, after consulting with  counsel, that Trustmark will be unable to
obtain any regulatory approval  required in order to consummate the Merger or
any such approval is accompanied  by terms or conditions which materially and
adversely impact the financial  consequences of the Merger to Trustmark. In
the event the Board of Directors  of  Trustmark desires to terminate this
Agreement because of an alleged breach  or  inaccuracy or change as provided
in (i) above, the Board of Directors must  notify Republic in writing of its
intent to terminate stating the cause  therefor. Republic shall have fifteen
(15) days from the receipt of such  notice to cure the alleged breach or
inaccuracy, subject to the approval of  Trustmark (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld).

 

 

(d) This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing with
the mutual  written consent of Trustmark and Republic and the approval of
such action by  their respective Boards of Directors.

 

 

(e) This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by the
Board of  Directors of Republic, if prior to the Effective Time, Republic
shall have  received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section
8.3(c)) and  Republic's Board of Directors determines in its good faith
judgment and in the  exercise of its fiduciary duties, based as to legal
matters on the advice of  independent legal counsel and as to financial
matters on the written advice  of  Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. or an
investment banking firm of national  reputation, that such alternative
Acquisition Proposal (if consummated pursuant  to its terms) is a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 8.3(d)), and that  the failure to terminate
this Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal would  be inconsistent with
the proper exercise of such fiduciary duties; provided,  however, that
termination under this clause (e) shall not be deemed effective  until
payment of the Termination Fee required by Section 8.3.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-34-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f)  This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
the Board of  Directors of Trustmark if Republic's Board of Directors shall
have  (i) resolved to accept an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) withdrawn or 
modified, in any manner that is adverse to Trustmark, its recommendation or 
approval of this Agreement or the Merger or recommended to Republic
shareholders  acceptance or approval of any alternative Acquisition Proposal,
or shall have  resolved to do the foregoing.

 

 

(g) This  Agreement may be terminated by Republic during the three-day period
following  the Determination Date if:

 

 

(i)  the  Average Closing Price of Trustmark Common Stock shall be less than
$25.988  per  share; and

 

 

(ii) (A)  the  number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price of
Trustmark Common Stock  by $31.50 shall be less than (B) the number obtained
by dividing the Average  Closing Price of the Trustmark peer group (the "Peer
Group") by the April 12,  2006 closing price of the Peer Group set forth on
Exhibit G hereto and  subtracting 0.15 from such quotient,

 

 

subject  to the following provisions of this Section 8.1(g). If Republic
elects to  exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence,  it shall give prompt written notice of such election to
Trustmark. During the  three (3) day period (the "Decision Period")
commencing with its actual receipt  of such notice, Trustmark may elect to
pay, as additional Merger Consideration  to each holder of Republic Stock
making a Share Election, additional shares  of  Trustmark Common Stock
and/or cash in an amount per share of Republic Stock  equal to the difference
between the Average Closing Price of Trustmark Common  Stock and $25.988 per
share (the "Gross Up Amount"). The Gross Up Amount shall  be paid (1) in
shares of Trustmark Common Stock valued for this purpose at  the  Average
Closing Price of Trustmark Common Stock on the Determination Date,  or  (2)
cash, as determined in the sole discretion of Trustmark (the "Gross Up 
Determination"). Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, 
Trustmark will have the option to change the percentages of cash and
Trustmark  Common Stock payable in the Gross Up Determination from those set
forth in  Section 1.9, provided that in no event may less than forty-five
percent (45%)  of  the Merger Consideration be payable in shares of
Trustmark Common Stock  (including any shares issued as Gross Up Amount). All
payments of Gross Up  Amounts, if any, shall be made as payments of
additional Merger Consideration  as  provided in accordance with Sections
1.5, and 1.12 through 1.15.

 

 

If  Trustmark makes the Gross Up Determination within the Decision Period, it
shall  give prompt written notice to Republic of such Gross Up Determination
and the  Gross Up Amount, whereupon Republic shall have no right to terminate
the  Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) and this Agreement shall
remain in  full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

If,  during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Determination  Date,  shares of Trustmark Common Stock shall be changed into
a different number of  shares or shares of a different class by reason of any
reclassification,  recapitalization, stock split, or stock dividend with a
record date within  said  period, the initial price of $31.50 per share of
Trustmark Common Stock shall  be  appropriately adjusted to account for such
change for the purposes of this  Section 8.1(g).

 

 

"Average  Closing Price" shall mean the average closing bid/asked market
price (computed  on the basis of the last trade of the day) of Trustmark
Common Stock and the  common stock of the Peer Group as reported on the New
York Stock Exchange  ("NYSE") or NASDAQ, as the case may be, for the five (5)
consecutive Trading  Days preceding the three (3) Trading Days prior to the
Determination Date.  For  purposes of this Agreement the term "Trading Day"
means any day on which the  NYSE and NASDAQ are open for trading. For the
purposes of this Agreement the  term "Determination Date" shall mean ten (10)
days prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

(h) This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing by either
Trustmark  or  Republic, if the shareholders of Republic fail to approve the
Merger at the  special meeting of shareholders called for such purpose (or
any adjournment  thereof).

 

 

Section  8.2. _Effect  of Termination_. In  the event of termination of
this Agreement by either Trustmark or Republic  as  provided in Section 8.1
or the abandonment of the Merger without breach by  any party hereto, this
Agreement (other than Sections 6.2 and 12.4) shall  become void and have no
effect, without any liability on the part of any party  or its directors,
officers or shareholders. Nothing contained in this  Section 8.2 shall
relieve any party hereto of any liability for a breach of  this Agreement.

 

 

Section  8.3. _Termination  Fee_. To  compensate Trustmark for entering
into this Agreement, taking actions to  consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder and incurring the costs  and  expenses related
thereto and other losses and expenses, including foregoing  the  pursuit of
other opportunities by Trustmark, Republic and Trustmark agree as  follows:

 

 

(a) Provided  that Trustmark shall not be in material breach of any covenant
or obligation  under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured promptly
following receipt  of written notice thereof by Republic specifying in
reasonable detail the basis  of such alleged breach), Republic shall pay to
Trustmark the sum of $7 million  (the "Termination Fee") if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by Republic  under the provisions of Section 8.1(e), (ii) by
either Trustmark or  Republic if at the time of any failure by the
shareholders of Republic to  approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger
there shall exist an Acquisition  Proposal with respect to Republic and,
within twelve months of the termination  of this Agreement, Republic enters
into a definitive agreement with any third  party with respect to any such
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) by Trustmark  under  the provisions of

(b) Any  payment required by paragraph (a) of this Section 8.3 shall become

business days after the execution and delivery by Republic of such 
definitive agreement.

 

 

(c) For  purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means a written

mathematically  ascertainable formula for calculating a price per share for
Republic Stock  regarding any of the following (other than the transactions
contemplated by  this  Agreement): (i) any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange,  recapitalization, business combination,
liquidation, dissolution, or other  similar transaction involving the sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,  transfer, or other disposition of, all or
substantially all of the assets or  equity securities or deposits of,
Republic or any Subsidiary, in a single  transaction or series of related
transactions which could reasonably be expected  to impede, interfere with,
prevent or materially delay the completion of the  Merger; (ii) any tender
offer or exchange offer for all or substantially all  of  the outstanding
shares of the capital stock of Republic or the filing of a  registration
statement under the Securities Act in connection therewith; or  (iii) any

(d) For  purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
Acquisition  Proposal made by a third person that the Board of Directors of
Republic  determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to
Republic's  shareholders than the Merger (taking into account, in good faith,
the written  opinion, with only customary qualifications, of Republic's
independent financial  advisor that the value of the consideration to
Republic's shareholders provided  for in such proposal exceeds the value of
the consideration to Republic's  shareholders provided for in the Merger) and
for which financing, to the extent  required, is then committed or which, in
the good faith judgment of the Board  of  Directors of Republic (taking into
account, in good faith, the written advice  of  Republic's independent
financial advisor), is reasonably capable of being  obtained by such third
person.

**COMPANY  MERGER AGREEMENT BETWEEN**

 

**REPUBLIC  BANCSHARES OF TEXAS, INC., A TEXAS CORPORATION,**

 

**AND  TRUSTMARK CORPORATION, A MISSISSIPPI CORPORATION**

 



 



 

This  Company Merger Agreement (the "Company  Merger Agreement")  is made 
and entered into as of the 13th  day of  April, 2006, between Republic
Bancshares of Texas, Inc., a Texas corporation  ("Republic") and Trustmark
Corporation, a Mississippi corporation  ("Trustmark").

 



 

Republic  and Trustmark have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization dated  as  of the date hereof (the "Agreement ") (terms not
defined herein shall have the  meaning set forth in the Agreement) setting
forth certain representations,  warranties, covenants and conditions relating
to the Merger.

 



 

Pursuant  to the Texas Business Corporations Act (the "TBCA") and the
Mississippi Business  Corporations Act (the "MBCA") (the TBCA and MBCA are
hereinafter sometimes  collectively referred to as the "Acts"), the merger of
Republic with and into  Trustmark, with Trustmark as the surviving
corporation shall be effected as  follows:

 



 

**A. ****Effective  Time.**   The  merger shall become effective (the
"Effective Time") immediately upon filing of  Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the States of Mississippi  and  Texas in accordance
with the Acts.

 



 

**B. ****Surviving  Corporation.**   Republic  shall be merged (the
"Merger")  with  and into Trustmark. Trustmark shall be the surviving
corporation pursuant to  the  provisions of, and with the effects provided
in, the Acts.

 



 

**C. ****Terms  and Conditions of the Merger.**   The  Merger shall be
consummated in accordance with the following terms and  conditions:

 



 

1.   _Merger  Consideration_.  As  a  result of and as part of the Merger and subject to the adjustments and  limitations provided for in Sections 2 through 12 of this Company Merger  Agreement, shares of Republic Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior  to  the Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 3 of  this Agreement), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the  part of the holder thereof, be converted into and represent the right to receive  cash or shares of common stock, no par value, of Trustmark ("Trustmark Common  Stock") or a combination of both (the "Merger Consideration"), on the basis  described herein.

 

 

2.   _Republic  Stock Options_.  Republic shall take all actions necessary to accelerate vesting of all the  outstanding Republic Stock options outstanding on the date of this Agreement  (which options are listed in _Schedule  2.2_   to the  Agreement); provided, however, no Republic Stock options that were not vested  as  of February 28, 2006, may become vested until ten (10) days prior to the  Effective Time. Holders of vested stock options who exercise them at least  three  (3) days prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to payment of the Merger  Consideration in accordance with this Company Merger Agreement. Trustmark shall  not assume, or provide any Merger Consideration for, a stock option that remains  unexercised within three (3) days of the Effective Time, or for any Republic  Stock acquired by exercising a stock option after three (3) days prior to the  Effective Time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

3.   _Dissenting  Shares_.  Each  share of Republic Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time, the holder of which has not voted in favor of the Merger and  who  has delivered a written demand for payment of the fair value of such shares  within the time and in the manner provided in Article 5.12 of the TBCA, is  referred to herein as a "Dissenting Share." Dissenting Shares shall not be  converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 1.5 of this Agreement and shall be entitled only to such  rights as are available to such holder pursuant to the applicable provisions  of  the TBCA unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall  have  effectively withdrawn or lost his right to appraisal and payment under Article  5.12 of the TBCA. If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or shall  have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's Dissenting Shares  shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become  exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger  Consideration without any interest thereon.

 

 

4.   _Election  Procedures and Exchange of Shares_.  At least  thirty (30) days prior to the date of the Republic shareholders meeting to  approve the Merger (the "Meeting Date"), Republic shall deliver to Trustmark a  list of Republic's shareholders which shall include each shareholder's name,  address and the number of shares of Republic Stock owned. Subject to the  provisions of Sections 1, 2, and 5 through 12 hereof, each holder of shares  of  Republic Stock as of the date thirty (30) days prior to the Meeting Date (the  "Record Date") and the option holders listed in _Schedule  2.2_   of the  Agreement shall be given the opportunity to elect, in accordance with the  procedures set forth in Section 6 hereof (the "Election"), to convert their  shares of Republic Stock into either:

 

 

a. cash  in  an amount equal to $44.00 per share for all of the shares of
Republic Stock  owned by such holder of record as of the Record Date (the
"Available Cash  Election"); or

 

 

b. shares  of  Trustmark Common Stock in an amount equal to the Exchange
Ratio times the number  of shares of Trustmark Common Stock owned by such
holder of record as of the  Record Date (the "Share Election"). The Exchange
Ratio shall be equal to 1.3968;  or

 

 

c. a  combination of cash and Trustmark Common Stock for all of the shares of
Republic  Stock owned by such holder of record as of the Record Date (the
"Combination  Election") in the proportions and with respect to the shares
specified by such  holder. In the event a Republic shareholder makes a
Combination Election, the  amount of cash to be received for each share of
Republic Stock converted into  cash shall be computed in accordance with
Section 4(a) and the amount of  Trustmark Common Stock to be received for
each share of Republic Stock converted  in Trustmark Common Stock shall be
computed in accordance with Section  4(b).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  elections made by the option holders shall only be binding on those
option  holders (i) if the Merger is approved by the Republic shareholders
and (ii)  the  option holder exercises the option for the shares of Republic
Stock at least  three (3) days prior to the Effective Time as provided in
Section  2.

 

 

5.   _Limitation  on Elections_.  If,  based on the Elections, the total cash payable to holders of Republic Stock  (including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and cash payable to  dissenters to the Merger) would be greater than forty-nine percent (49%) of  the  total value of the Merger Consideration, or the total Trustmark Common Stock  issued to holders of Republic Stock would be greater than fifty-one percent  (51%) of the total value of the Merger Consideration, Trustmark shall have  the  right to proportionally adjust the cash and Trustmark Common Stock to be issued  to holders of Republic Stock so that the total cash payable to holders of  Republic Stock (including cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and cash  payable to dissenters to the Merger) shall be equal to forty-nine percent (49%)  of the Merger Consideration and the total Trustmark Common Stock to be issued  shall be equal to fifty-one percent (51%) of the Merger Consideration or  3,400,000 shares. For purposes of the calculation contained herein, all  dissenting shareholders shall be deemed to have received cash in an amount  equal  to the amount of the Available Cash Election for such shares.

 



 

6.   _Form  of Election_.  Forms  for making the Election (the "Forms  of  Election"),  shall  be mailed to the option holders and holders of Republic Stock as of the Record  Date as part of the proxy statement (the "Proxy  Statement")  for the  special shareholders\'  meeting  of Republic called to consider the Merger. The Forms of Election must be  properly completed and returned to Republic on or before the Meeting Date in  accordance with the instructions applicable thereto. Any holder of shares of  Republic Stock who does not return a properly executed Form of Election on  or  before the Meeting Date shall be deemed to have made a Share Election. If the  Merger is approved, Republic shall furnish Trustmark with the original Forms  of  Election as soon as is practicable following the shareholders\'  meeting  of Republic.

 



 

7.   _Change  in Election; Revocation_.  Any  holder of Republic Stock may, at any time, change an Election by submitting  a  revised, subsequently dated Form of Election on or before the Meeting  Date.

 

 

8.   _Distribution  of Trustmark Common Stock and Cash_.  

 



 

a.  Promptly  following the Effective Time of the Merger, Trustmark shall
send to holders  of  Republic Stock of record as of the Closing Date
transmittal materials for use  in  exchanging their shares of Republic Stock
for the Merger Consideration.  Trustmark shall thereafter promptly pay the
Merger Consideration to holders  of  Republic Stock who have properly
submitted transmittal materials and surrendered  their share certificates to
Trustmark. Unless and until the share certificates  are properly surrendered,
a former holder of Republic Stock shall not be  entitled to receive the cash
and/or share certificates to which such holder  is  entitled or any
dividends payable with respect to such shares. Upon the proper  surrender of
such Republic Stock, the former Republic shareholder shall be  issued the
Trustmark shares and/or shall be paid the cash and dividends (without 
interest) to which such shareholder is entitled.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

b.  Former  shareholders of Republic who have made a Share Election or
Combination Election  shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at
any meeting of Trustmark's  shareholders the number of shares of Trustmark
Common Stock into which their  shares are converted, after such shareholders
of Republic have surrendered  their  certificates in exchange therefor.

 

 

c.  After  the  Effective Time, the stock transfer ledger of Republic shall
be closed and there  shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
Republic of the shares  of  Republic Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to such time. If, after  the Effective Time, certificates
are presented to Trustmark, they shall be  promptly exchanged as provided in
this Section 8.

 

 

d.  If  any  certificate representing shares of Trustmark Common Stock is
to be issued in  a  name other than that in which the certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor  is registered, it shall be a condition of
the issuance thereof that the  certificate so surrendered shall be
appropriately endorsed (or accompanied  by an  appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form (reasonably  satisfactory to
Trustmark) for transfer, and that the person requesting such  exchange shall
pay to Trustmark in advance any transfer or other taxes required  by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Trustmark  Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the 
certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish  to  the satisfaction of the Trustmark that such tax has been paid
or not  payable.

 

 

e.  Neither  Trustmark, Republic, or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder  of  shares of Republic Stock for any Trustmark Common Stock
(or dividends or  distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly
delivered to a public  official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar  laws.

 

 

9.   _Fractional  Shares_.  No  fractional shares of Trustmark Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender  for exchange of certificates representing shares of Republic Stock. In lieu  of  any such fractional share, each holder of shares of Republic Stock who would  otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Trustmark Common Stock will  be  paid cash upon the proper surrender of all the stock certificates representing  shares of Republic Stock held by such holder in the amount equal to the product  of such fraction multiplied by $31.50.

 



 

10. _Calculations  and Adjustments_.  

 



 

a.  If,  between the date of this Company Merger Agreement and the Effective
Time, shares  of Trustmark Common Stock shall be changed into a different
number of shares  or  shares of a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization,  stock split, or stock dividend with a
record date within said period, the number  of shares of Trustmark Common
Stock to be issued and delivered upon the  consummation of the Merger as
provided in this Agreement shall be appropriately  and proportionately
adjusted so that the number of such shares that will be  issued and delivered
as a result of the Merger will equal the number of shares  of Trustmark
Common Stock that holders of shares of Republic Stock would have  received
had the record date for such reclassification, recapitalization, stock 
split, or stock dividend been immediately following the Effective  Time.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

b.  If,  between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
number of shares  of Republic Stock issued shall be increased due to the
purchase of shares by  Republic's employee stock purchase plan, the Exchange
Ratio, the Available Cash  Election share price, the Merger Consideration to
be delivered pursuant to  this  Agreement, and any other relevant provision
of this Agreement shall be adjusted  to reflect all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Republic Stock at the  Effective Time.

 



 

11. _Lost  or Destroyed Certificates_.  Any  person whose certificates representing shares of Republic Stock shall have  been  lost or destroyed may nevertheless obtain the shares of Trustmark Common Stock  and/or cash to which such holder of Republic Stock is entitled as a result  of  the Merger if such holder provides Trustmark with a statement certifying such  loss or destruction and an indemnity satisfactory to Trustmark sufficient to  indemnify Trustmark against any loss or expense that may occur as a result  of  such lost or destroyed certificate being thereafter presented to Trustmark  for  exchange.

 



 

12. _Ratification  by Shareholders_.  This  Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Republic in accordance  with  applicable provisions of law and the respective Articles of Incorporation and  Bylaws of Republic. Republic and Trustmark shall proceed expeditiously and  cooperate fully in the procurement of any other consents and approvals and  the  taking of any other actions in satisfaction of all other requirements prescribed  by law or otherwise necessary for consummation of the Merger on the terms herein  provided, including, without limitation, the preparation and submission of  all  necessary filings, requests for waivers and certificates with the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the OCC.

 

 

13. _Tax  Consequences_.  It is  intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the parties hereby adopt  this Company Merger Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning  of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated  thereunder.  The  Republic shareholders receiving cash consideration under this Company Merger  Agreement shall be treated for Federal Income Tax purposes as a taxable event  to  the shareholders of the Republic.

 

 

**D.   ****Governance  of the Surviving Corporation.**   The  Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Trustmark shall be the Articles of  Incorporation
and Bylaws of the merged corporations following the Effective  Time  of the
Merger, unless and until the same shall be amended in accordance with  the 
provisions thereof and the MBCA.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5

duties to the Association; and provided further,  that  no person shall be
so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any  administrative proceeding or
action instituted by an appropriate bank regulatory  agency which proceeding
or action results in a final order assessing civil  money  penalties or
requiring affirmative action by an individual or individuals  in the  form
of payments to the Association. The foregoing right of indemnification  or 
reimbursement shall not be exclusive of other rights to which such person, 
his  heirs, executors, or administrators, may be entitled as a matter of
law.  The  Association may, upon affirmative vote of a majority of its Board
of Directors,  purchase insurance to indemnify its directors, honorary or
advisory directors,  officers and employees to the extent that such
indemnification is allowed  in  these Articles of Association. Such
insurance may, but need not, be for the  benefit of all directors, honorary
or advisory directors, officers or  employees.

 



 

_ELEVENTH_.  These  Articles of Association may be amended at any regular or
special meeting  of the  shareholders by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the  stock  of this Association, unless the vote of the
holders of a greater amount of  stock  is required by law, and in that case
by the vote of the holders of such greater  amount.

 



 

**Section  10.**   This Bank Merger Agreement may be terminated in the
manner and to the extent  provided in the Agreement.

 



 

**Section  11.**   This  Bank  Merger Agreement shall be ratified and
confirmed by the affirmative vote  of  shareholders of each of the merging
banks owning at least sixty-seven percent  (67%) of its capital stock
outstanding, at a meeting to be held on the call  of  the directors; and the
Bank Merger shall become effective at the time specified  in the approval of
Bank Merger to be issued by the Comptroller of the Currency  of the United
States.

_______________,  2006

 



 



 



 

Trustmark  Corporation

 

P.  O. Box  291

 

Jackson,  MS 39205

 



 

Dear  Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

I  am a  shareholder of Republic Bancshares of Texas, Inc., a Texas
corporation  ("Republic"), and may become a shareholder of Trustmark
Corporation, a  Mississippi corporation ("Trustmark"), when Republic merges
with and into  Trustmark (the "Merger") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization  dated as of April 13, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), between
Trustmark and  Republic. In consideration of the Merger Agreement and the
benefits I will  derive therefrom, I hereby enter into this Affiliate
Agreement ("Agreement")  with Trustmark as follows:

 



 

1. _Affiliate  Status; Accounting and Tax Treatment_.  I  understand that I may be considered an "affiliate" of Republic, that Trustmark  intends to account for the Merger as a purchase, and that Trustmark intends  to  treat the Merger as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal  Revenue Code (the "Code").

 



 

 

 

2. _Covenants  and Warranties_.  I  represent, warrant, covenant, and agree that:

 

 

 



 

(a) I  understand that Trustmark is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer,  or other disposition of shares of common stock of Trustmark (the
"Trustmark  Common Stock") by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Securities  Act")  or to  take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption  from such registration available.

 



 

(b) I  understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to 
Trustmark\'s  transfer agent with respect to shares of Trustmark Common Stock
issued to  me as  a result of the Merger and that there may be placed on the
certificates for  such  shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in  substance:

 



 

"The  shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which  Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The
shares  represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance
with  the  terms of an agreement, dated as of April ___, 2006, between the
registered  holder hereof and Trustmark, a copy of which agreement is on file
at the  principal offices of Trustmark."

 



 

(c) I  understand that, unless any transfer by me of the Trustmark Common
Stock  issued  to  me as a result of the Merger is made in conformity with
the provisions of  Rule  145(d) under the Securities Act, Trustmark reserves
the right, in its sole  discretion, to place the following legend on the
certificates issued to my  transferee:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"The  shares represented by this certificate were received in a transaction
to  which  Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares
have been acquired  by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any  distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933 and  may  not be offered, sold, pledged, or otherwise
transferred except in accordance  with an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act  of  1933."

 



 

(d) It  is  understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs
2(b) and (c)  above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such  legends if I shall have delivered to Trustmark: (i) a copy of a
"no-action" letter from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"), or  an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to  Trustmark, to the effect that such legend is not required
for purposes of  the  Securities Act; or (ii) evidence or representations
satisfactory to Trustmark  that the Trustmark Common Stock represented by
such certificates is being  or has  been sold in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145(d).

 



 

3. _Agreement  on Voting_.  I  hereby agree that I will vote all shares of capital stock of Republic (the  "Republic Stock") which I own or control, directly or indirectly, (i) in favor  of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and any other action requested by  Trustmark in furtherance thereof, (ii) against any action or agreement that  would result in a breach of any covenant, representation, or warranty or  any  other obligation or agreement of Republic contained in the Merger Agreement,  or  any of my other obligations or agreements under this Agreement and (iii)  against  any Acquisition Proposal (as that term is defined in Section 8.3 of the Merger  Agreement) or any other action, agreement, or transaction that is intended,  or  could reasonably be expected, to materially impede, interfere or be inconsistent  with, delay, postpone, discourage, or materially or adversely affect the  consummation of the Merger or this Agreement. Furthermore, I understand and  agree that the voting of my shares of Republic Stock in favor of the Merger  will  waive any right I may have to dissent from the Merger pursuant to the provisions  of Article 5.12 of the Texas Business Corporation Act, as amended.

 



 

4. _No  Transfers_.  Prior  to the special shareholders meeting of Republic to approve the Merger, I  agree  not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise  dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, commitment or other arrangement  or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or  other  disposition of, any of my shares of Republic Stock. In the case of any transfer  by operation of law, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the  transferee(s). Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms  of  this Section 4 shall be null and void.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5. _Other  Persons_.  I  recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 4  also  apply to: (i) my spouse; (ii) any relative of me or my spouse who shares  my  home; (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse, or any such relative  collectively own at least a ten percent (10%) beneficial interest or of which  any of the foregoing serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar capacity;  and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which I, my spouse, and  any  such relative collectively own at least ten percent (10%) of any class of  equity  securities or of the equity interest.

 



 

6. _Filing  of Reports by Trustmark Corporation_.  Trustmark shall, for a period of two years after the consummation of the  Merger,  use its best efforts to file on a timely basis all reports with the SEC required  to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of  1934,  as amended, so that the public information provisions of Rule 145(d) promulgated  by the SEC as the same are presently in effect will be available to the  undersigned in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any shares of  Trustmark Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the  Merger.

 



 

 

 

7. _Miscellaneous_.

 

 

 



 

(a) Any  notice required to be sent to any party hereunder shall be sent by
registered  or  certified mail, return receipt requested, using the
addresses set forth herein  or in the Merger Agreement or such other
addresses as shall be furnished  in  writing by the parties.

 



 

(b) This  Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas.

 



 

8. _Understanding  of Requirements_.  I have  carefully read this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and discussed their  requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer,  or otherwise dispose of Trustmark Common Stock after the Merger, to the extent  I  felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Republic.

This  Agreement is executed as of this the ____ day of ____________,  2006.

**_AMENDMENT  TO_**

 

**_EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT_**

 



 



 

The  Employment Agreement effective as of the 7th of February, 2006 (the
"Agreement")  by and among Republic National Bank, a national banking
association (the  "Bank"), and Republic Bancshares of Texas, Inc., a Texas
corporation (the  "Company") (hereinafter jointly referred to as the
"Employer"), and C. P.  Bryan  (the "Executive"), an individual who resides
in Houston, Texas, is hereby  amended, pursuant to Paragraph 15 of the
Agreement, to clarify the original  intent of the Agreement, as follows:

 



 

Paragraph  8(a) of the Agreement is amended by adding the following sentence
at the  end of  that paragraph:

 



 

"The  lump-sum payment under this Paragraph 8(a) shall reduce, dollar-for-
dollar,  any  separation payment that otherwise would be owed to the
Executive pursuant  to  Paragraph 5(a) of the Agreement if the Executive was
terminated by the Employer  (or its successor) without Cause, or if the
Executive terminated this Agreement  for Good Reason, following a Change in
Control."

 



 

Because  this amendment clarifies the original intent of the parties to the
Agreement,  the amendment shall be effective as of February 7, 2006, as if it
had been  included in the original Agreement. All other provisions of the
Agreement  shall  remain in full force and effect on and after the date of
this  amendment.

 



 

IN  WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this amendment to be duly
executed  as  of ___________________, 2006. The Executive hereby
acknowledges receipt of  a  copy of this amendment duly signed by the
Employer.

**_EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT_**

 



 



 

This  Employment Agreement (this "Agreement") is effective as of
_____________,  2006  (the "Effective Date"), by and among Trustmark
National Bank, a national  banking  association (the "Bank") and Trustmark
Corporation, a Mississippi corporation  (the "Company") (hereinafter jointly
referred to as the "Employer"), and C. P.  Bryan (the "Executive"), an
individual who resides in Houston, Texas. 

 



 

W  I T N E  S S E T H:

 

 

In  consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this 
Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 



 

**1. ****_Employment_** **.**   Employer  agrees to employ the Executive as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of  Trustmark Texas. The Executive shall
have responsibilities, duties and authority  customarily accorded to and
expected of an executive holding such position.  The  Executive agrees to
devote full time, attention and efforts to promote and  further the business
of the Bank. The Executive shall report to the Chief  Executive Officer of
the Bank, and shall perform his duties under this Agreement  in accordance
with such reasonable standards established from time to time  by  such Chief
Executive Officer.

 

 

**2. ****_Compensation  and Benefits_** **.**   For all  services rendered
by the Executive to the Employer and its subsidiaries,  the  Employer shall
compensate the Executive as follows:

 

 

(a) _Base  Salary._ Commencing  on the Effective Date, the Employer agrees
to pay the Executive a base salary  of  not less than $350,000 per annum,
less applicable statutory deductions (the  "Base Salary"), payable on a
regular basis in accordance with the Employer\'s  standard payroll
procedures, but not less frequently than monthly. The amount  of  Base
Salary shall be reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank  no
less  often than annually and may be increased from time to time by such
amounts  as  the Human Resources Committee of the Employer at its discretion
may  decide.

 

 

(b) _Bonus  Program._   Executive shall be eligible for  any  bonus that
may be associated with similarly situated officers, including  but not 
limited to an annual bonus of up to 75% of his annual salary, based upon 
performance objectives for Trustmark Texas as jointly established by the 
Executive and the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and the  Executive's 
performance evaluated against those performance  objectives. It is
contemplated that based on the Employer's annual bonus  program, the target
bonus will be 50% of the Executive's base salary. The  Executive will have
the opportunity by exceeding budget objectives by 10%  to  receive an annual
bonus up to 75% of his annual salary. The Employer's Executive  Compensation
Plan includes a threshold whereby the Executive receives 37.5%  of  the
Executive's annual salary if 90% of the budget objectives are met. These 
percentages are prorated based upon actual results achieved between 75% and 
150%  of the target, which is 50% of the Executive's base salary. There is no
bonus  under the Employer's annual bonus program if 90% of the budget
objectives are  not met by the Executive.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Expenses_.  During  the term of Executive\'s employment, Executive
shall be reimbursed for any  and  all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by Executive in performance of  his  services and duties as specified in
this Agreement or incurred by Executive  on  behalf of, or in furtherance of
the business of, the Employer, including,  but  not limited to, professional
dues and fees, and business expenses incurred  in  connection with travel
and entertainment; provided, however, that Executive  shall submit to the
Employer satisfactory supporting receipts and information  with respect to
such reasonable costs and expenses.

 

 

(d) _Tax  Planning._   During  the term of Executive\'s employment,
Executive shall be reimbursed for reasonable  costs and expenses incurred by
Executive to obtain tax and estate planning  services, up to a maximum
reimbursement of $25,000; provided, however, that  Executive shall submit to
the Employer satisfactory supporting receipts and  information with respect
to such reasonable costs and expenses.

 

 

(e) _Other  Benefits._   During  the term of Executive\'s employment, he
shall be entitled (i) to receive  health insurance benefits with the same
coverages and deductibles as applicable  to other senior executive officers;
(ii) to participate in the Employer\'s  other  benefit plans such as 401k
plans, deferred compensation plan, disability  plans,  vacation and sick
leave, and other benefits; (iii) to continued use of the  Employer-owned
automobile provided for Executive's use immediately before the  Effective
Date, or to an allowance of up to $1,000 per month to lease a  comparable
automobile for Executive's use, provided the Executive operates and  utilizes
the automobile as the Executive's principal business vehicle; and (iv)  to
membership, including the Employer's payment of all fees and dues, at 
Champions Golf Club or another comparable club, the membership of which will 
continue until the Executive reaches the age of 65.

 

 

**3. ****_Term  of the Agreement_** **.**   The term  of this Agreement
shall begin on the Effective Date and continue for three  (3)  years (the
"Term") unless terminated sooner as herein provided, and such  Term  shall
be automatically renewed for a period of three (3) years on each  anniversary
of the Effective Date (except for any anniversary occurring after 
termination of this Agreement) on the same terms and conditions contained 
herein  in effect as of the time of renewal, unless either party delivers
written  notice  to the other of its intention not to renew this Agreement
at least sixty  (60)  days prior to any such anniversary date.

 

 

**4. ****_Termination  and Rights upon Certain Terminations_**.  This 
Agreement and the Executive\'s employment may be terminated in any one of 
the  following ways:

 

 

(a) _Termination  as a Result of the Executive\'s Death_.  The  death of
the Executive shall immediately terminate this Agreement, and the 
Executive\'s estate shall be entitled to a payment of 50% of Executive\'s
Base  Salary, less applicable statutory deductions, for the remainder of the
three  (3)  year Term during which Executive\'s employment terminates, which
payment shall  be  made in one lump sum on the date of termination of
Executive\'s employment  or as  soon as administratively feasible
thereafter, but in no event after the later  of  (i) the last day of the
calendar year in which Executive\'s employment  terminates, or (ii) the
fifteenth (15th)  day of  the third calendar month following the date of
termination of Executive\'s  employment, and any other benefits under
insurance programs and other employee  plans in accordance with the terms of
such arrangements.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-2-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) _Termination  on Account of Disability_.  If, as  a result of
incapacity due to physical or mental illness or injury, the  Executive shall
have been absent from his full-time duties hereunder for  six (6) 
consecutive months and the Employer has in effect disability insurance
providing  coverage to Executive at least as beneficial to the Executive as
is currently  provided to the Executive by the Employer, the Employer may
terminate the  Executive\'s employment provided Executive is unable to resume
his full-time  duties with reasonable accommodation, and the Executive shall
be entitled  to  payment of 50% of Executive\'s Base Salary, less applicable
statutory deductions,  for the remainder of the three (3) year Term during
which Executive\'s employment  terminates, which payment shall be made in one
lump sum on the date of  termination of Executive\'s employment or as soon as
administratively feasible  thereafter, but in no event after the later of (i)
the last day of the calendar  year in which Executive\'s employment
terminates, or (ii) the fifteenth  (15th)  day of  the third calendar month
following the date of termination of Executive\'s  employment, and any other
benefits under insurance programs and other employee  plans in accordance
with the terms of such arrangements.

 

 

(c) _Termination  by the Employer for Cause_.  The  Employer may terminate
this Agreement for "Cause," which shall mean:  (i) the Executive\'s acts of
dishonesty; (ii) the Executive\'s acts of  willful misconduct; (iii) the
Executive\'s acts that breach his fiduciary  duties to the Employer (or any
subsidiary); or (iv) the Executive\'s acts  which breach his obligations
pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to termination  for Cause, the Employer
shall (i) provide the Executive with written notice  describing in detail the
actions taken by the Executive and the reasons why  Employer believes that
such actions constitute Cause, (ii) afford the  Executive with the
opportunity to attend a meeting of the entire Board of  Employer at which he
may make a presentation challenging the Employer\'s  determination that Cause
exists, which meeting shall not occur until  ten (10) business days after
Executive receives the written notice, and  (iii) if, after such meeting, the
Employer continues to believe that Cause  exists, give Executive thirty (30)
days to cure the basis for the  Employer\'s determination that Cause exists.
If the basis for the Employer\'s  determination that Cause exists has not
been cured within such thirty (30)  day period, or if not practicable to be
cured within thirty (30) days, the  Executive has not made reasonable efforts
to cure, then Employer may terminate  this Agreement for Cause by giving
written notice of termination to the  Executive, specifically stating the
grounds upon which the termination is  based.  In the event the Executive\'s
employment is terminated by the Employer for  Cause,  the Executive shall be
entitled to a lump sum cash amount representing all  compensation and
benefits earned by the Executive and unpaid as of the date  of  termination,
less applicable statutory deductions, to be paid within six  (6)  days of
termination.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) _Termination  without Cause by Employer or Termination by Executive for
Good Reason Following  a Change in Control of Company_.  At any  time after
the commencement of employment, (i) the Employer may without Cause  terminate
this Agreement and the Executive\'s employment, or (ii) Executive  may 
terminate this Agreement and Executive's employment for Good Reason (as
defined  in Paragraph 6) following a Change in Control of Company, effective
thirty  (30)  days after written notice is provided by the terminating party
to the other  party. Upon the Executive\'s termination pursuant to this
subparagraph (d),  Executive shall be entitled to receive payment in the
amount of his then  existing base salary for the duration of the Post-
Employment Restricted Period  and any other benefits earned by Executive as
of the date of termination,  less  applicable statutory deductions. Such
payments shall be made in accordance  with  Employer's usual payroll
practices for senior executives.

 

 

(e) _Resignation  of Executive._ Except  for a termination by Executive for
Good Reason following a Change in Control  of  Company as set forth in
subparagraph (d) above, Executive may voluntarily  terminate the Term and
resign from employment with Employer by written notice  to  Employer
specifying the effective date of such resignation or termination  and,  in
such event the termination shall be treated as a voluntary termination 
without Good Reason by Executive. Thereafter, Executive shall be entitled 
to  receive payment in the amount of fifty percent (50%) of Executive's
then  existing base salary for the duration of the Post Employment Restricted
Period  and any other benefits earned by Executive as of the date of
termination,  less  applicable statutory deductions. Such payments shall be
made in accordance  with  Employer's usual payroll practices for senior
executives.

 

 

(f) _Non-renewal  of Term_.  In the  event of either party's non-renewal of
this Agreement at the end of the Term,  Executive shall be entitled to a lump
sum cash amount representing all  compensation and benefits earned by
Executive and unpaid as of the date of  termination, less applicable
statutory deductions, to be paid within fourteen  (14) days of termination.

 

 

**5. ****_Termination  Benefits_**.  If  Executive\'s employment is
terminated at any time, in addition to the termination  benefits described
above in Paragraph 4,  Executive shall be entitled to the post-termination
benefits described below,  provided that Executive (or his personal
representative, in the case of the  Executive's death) has executed a release
of claims in substantially the form  attached to this Agreement and the
release has become effective. For  purposes of this Paragraph 5  and 
Paragraph 7,  the  term "Change in Control" shall mean the Company's
acquisition of Republic  Bankshares of Texas, Inc. and its affiliates
("Republic") on the Effective  Date.

 

 

(a) The  Employer shall provide medical, dental and prescription drug
insurance coverage  for Executive and his spouse and any dependents,
comparable to the coverage  to  which the Executive was entitled under
Republic's plans immediately prior to the  date of the Change in Control,
until the death of Executive and his spouse  and,  in the case of
dependents, until the dependents are no longer eligible for  dependent
coverage. The Employer shall pay all premiums associated with such  coverage;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(b) Executive  shall be entitled to a  payment  of $200 per month, payable
on the first day of each month, which is intended  to  allow Executive to
continue participation in all  life  insurance, accident and disability
plans, programs or arrangements in which  the  Executive was entitled to
participate prior to the date of termination, until  the  Executive\'s
commencement of full time employment with a new  employer;

 

 

(c) Executive  shall be entitled to payment by the Employer of the annual
premiums for  Executive\'s long-term care policy in effect at the time of the
Change in  Control  until the end of the premium payment period for such
policy; and

 

 

(d) Executive  shall be entitled to a payment of $600 per month, payable on
the first day  of  each month, which is intended to allow Executive to
continue membership at  Champions Golf Club or another comparable club, until
the later of (i) the  expiration of the three (3) year Term during which
Executive\'s employment  terminates, or (ii) Executive\'s attainment of the
age of 65.

 

 

Notwithstanding  any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at the
time of Executive\'s  termination of employment with the Employer, he is a
"specified employee"  as  defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended  (the  "Code"), no payment or benefit will be
provided under this Section 5 until  the  earliest of (A) the date which is
6 months after the date of Executive\'s  termination of employment, or (B)
the date of Executive\'s death. The first  sentence of this paragraph shall
apply only to the extent required to avoid  Executive\'s incurrence of any
additional tax or interest under Section 409A  of  the Code or any
regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder.  In  addition, if
any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation)  would
cause Executive to incur any additional tax or interest under Section  409A 
of the Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, 
the  Employer shall reform such provision; provided that the Employer shall
(i)  maintain, to the maximum extent practicable, the original intent of
the  applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A
of  the  Code and (ii) notify and consult with the Executive regarding such
amendments  or  modifications prior to adopting any such change.

 

 

**6. ****_Good  Reason Defined_**.  For  purposes of this Agreement, the
Executive shall have "Good Reason" to terminate  this Agreement and his
employment hereunder if, without the Executive\'s prior  written consent, (i)
the Executive is demoted by means of a reduction in  authority,
responsibilities, duties or title to a position of materially  less  stature
or importance within the Employer than as described in  Paragraph 1 
hereof;  (ii) the Employer breaches this Agreement in any material respect
and fails  to  cure such breach within ten (10) days after the Executive
delivers written  notice and a written description of such breach to the
Employer, which notice  shall specifically refer to this paragraph of this
Agreement; (iii) the Employer  materially reduces the Executive\'s Base
Salary or materially reduces his  benefits, or (iv) the Executive is
transferred to an office outside of the  greater Houston, Texas metropolitan
area.

**7. ****_Certain  Payments upon Change in Control_** **. ** As  a  result
of the Change in Control (as defined in Paragraph 5,  above),  Executive
became entitled to receive a lump sum cash amount equal to $1,500,000,  which
shall be paid by Republic on or before the Effective Date. As a result  of 
the Change in Control, Executive also became entitled to full rights, title 
and  interest in Executive\'s office artwork, including but not limited to
the  painting of the 18th  green at  Champions, as well as Executive\'s
Republic-owned automobile, or an automobile  of  equivalent value; Republic
shall deliver title to the artwork and automobile  to  Executive on or
before the Effective Date, and shall also pay a lump sum  payment  to
Executive equal to any income tax attributable to the artwork and automobile 
on or before the Effective Date. If any payments to which the Executive is 
entitled as a result of the Change in Control pursuant to (a) the two 
preceding sentences of this Paragraph 7,  (b) any benefit plans or stock
plans maintained by Republic prior to the  Change in Control, (c) his
employment agreement with Republic as in effect  at  the time of the Change
in Control (the "Prior Agreement"), or (d) Paragraph 5  of this  Agreement,
would constitute "parachute payments" (as defined in Section  280G(b)(2) of
the Code), the Executive shall receive additional payments  ("Gross  Up
Payments"), so that after the payment by the Executive of all taxes (other 
than the tax under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax")), penalties, 
and  interest imposed upon the Gross Up Payments, the Executive shall retain
an  amount of the Gross Up Payments equal to the Excise Tax on all
payments.  In the  case of the lump sum cash payment described in the first
sentence of this  Paragraph 7;  the  value of the artwork, automobile, and
lump-sum payment described in the second  sentence of Paragraph 7;  any 
parachute payment attributable to stock options (whether or not exercised 
upon  the Change in Control); and any other amount that was subject to the
Excise  Tax  at the time of the Change in Control, Republic shall make the
Gross Up Payments  to Executive, and the Employer shall not assume
responsibility for making  the  Gross Up Payments. All payments to be made,
and actions to be taken, by Republic  under this Paragraph 7 shall be
referred to as the "Republic Change in Control  Payments." To the extent that
payments due after the Change in Control pursuant  to Paragraph 5  of this 
Agreement are deemed to be parachute payments, the Employer shall make the 
related Gross Up Payments to Executive.

 

 

**8. ****_Time-Vested  Stock Award_** **. ** The  Employer regards
Executive's services for an extended period after the Change in  Control as
being crucial to the continued success and future development  of the 
business the Employer has acquired as a result of the Change in Control,  and
to  the development of the Employer's other business in the same region. In
order to  retain Executive's services for an extended period following the
Change in  Control and to provide Executive with an opportunity to share
directly in  the  success of the Employer's business, the Employer will
grant 16,130 shares of the  Employer's time-vested stock to the Executive as
of the Effective Date, to vest  over a period of three years following the
Effective Date. A form of Time-Vested  Stock Agreement setting forth the
terms of the time-vested stock grant is  attached to this Agreement.

 

 

**9. ****_Non-Competition  Covenant_** **. ** The  Executive hereby agrees
that, during the Term and for a period of two (2)  years  following the
termination of the Executive's employment with the Employer (the "Post-
Employment Restricted Period"), the Executive shall not engage or invest  in,
own, manage, operate, finance, control or participate in the ownership, 
management, operation, financing or control of, be employed by, lend the 
Executive's name to, lend the Executive's credit to or render services or
advice  to any business that competes __ with  the  Employer's Business in
the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metropolitan area (as  defined by the United 
States Office  of  Management and Budget  from  time to time), or any
successor "metropolitan statistical area" thereto;  _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  the Executive may purchase or otherwise acquire up to three percent
of any  class  of securities of any enterprise if such securities are listed
on any national  or  regional securities exchange or have been registered
under Section 12(g)  of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Nothing in this Agreement shall  be  construed to prevent Executive from
seeking or holding employment or a  consulting relationship after Executive's
term of employment, with any person,  firm, corporation, or other entity,
which is not in competition with the  business of the Employer as defined in
this Paragraph 9  of the  Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Employer's Business" means  banking, trust, lending, other financial
services, and other services related  to  or provided in connection with the
operation of the Employer or any of its  affiliates.

**10. ****_Non-Solicitation  and Non-Inference Covenant_** **. ** The 
Executive hereby agrees that, during the Term and for the Post-Employment 
Restricted Period, the Executive shall not directly  or indirectly solicit,
contact, call upon, or communicate with, or attempt  to do  so, any person
or entity, or any representative of any person or entity,  in  order to
obtain  any  business in competition with the Employer's Business from any
of the Employer's  or any of its affiliates' depositors, borrowers, customers
or suppliers with  whom the Executive had Material Contact in the Houston-
Sugar Land-Baytown  metropolitan area (as defined by the United  States
Office  of  Management and Budget  from  time to time), or any successor
"metropolitan statistical area" thereto. In  addition, the Executive shall
take no action that would interfere with the  Employer's or any affiliate's
relationship with any of its depositors,  borrowers, customers or suppliers,
regardless of whether the Executive had  Material Contact with such
depositors, borrowers, customers, or suppliers,  by  attempting to convince
them to cease doing business with the Employer or  any  affiliate, or to
reduce the quantity of such business, or to change its  preferences to
another financial services provider, lender, supplier, or  vendor.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Material Contact" means personal contact, or 
the supervision of the efforts of those who have direct personal contact 
with a  depositor, borrower, customer or supplier, during the last two years
of the  Executive's employment with the Employer and its affiliates (or with
any  predecessor that is acquired by the Employer or any affiliate).

 

 

**11. ****_Non-Recruitment  Covenant_** **.**   The  Executive agrees that,
during the Term and for the Post-Employment Restricted  Period, the Executive
shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or attempt  to  solicit any
employee of the Employer or any of its affiliates for the purpose  of 
encouraging, enticing, or causing said employee to terminate employment with 
the  Employer or any of its affiliates. The Executive agrees that, during
the  Term  and for the Post-Employment Restricted Period, the Executive
shall not, directly  or indirectly, hire or retain the services of any person
who is, or was last,  employed by the Employer or any of its affiliates.

 

 

**12. ****_Non-Disparagement  Covenant_**.  The  Executive hereby agrees
that the Executive will not directly or indirectly  disparage or subvert the
business activities of the Employer or any of its  affiliates, or make any
statement reflecting negatively on the Employer or  any  of its affiliates,
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,  affiliates,
agents or representatives, including, but not limited to, any  matters
relating to the operation or management of the Employer or any of  its 
affiliates, the Executive's employment, and the termination of the
Executive's  employment, irrespective of the truthfulness or falsity of
such  statement.

that Employer\'s business is highly competitive, that as of the  Effective
Date, Employer has given Executive Confidential Information of  Employer that

**15. ****_Inventions_** **.**   Executive shall disclose promptly to the
Employer any and all significant  conceptions and ideas for inventions,
improvements and valuable discoveries,  whether patentable or not, which are
conceived or made by the Executive,  solely  or jointly with another, during

the Executive shall execute any and all applications, assignments  or  other
instruments that the Employer shall deem necessary to apply for and  obtain 
Letters Patent of the United States or any foreign country or to otherwise 
protect the Employer\'s interest therein.

 

 

**16. ****_Trade  Secrets_** **.**   The  Executive agrees not to, during
or after the term of this Agreement, directly  or  indirectly, disclose (or
use for the benefit of any person other than the  Employer) the specific
terms of the Employer\'s (including any subsidiary)  relationships or
agreements with their respective significant vendors or  customers or any
other trade secret or other confidential business information  of the
Employer (including any subsidiary), whether in existence or proposed,  to 
any person, firm, partnership, corporation or business for any reason or 
purpose  whatsoever, except and only to the extent (i) such information is or
becomes  known to the public generally through no fault of the Executive or
(ii) required  by law or legal process following notice to the Employer.

 

 

**17. ****_Enforcement  and Remedies_** **.**

 

 

(a) _Application. _ For  purposes of the obligations contained in Paragraphs
9  through 16,  the  term "Employer" shall include Republic and its
affiliates, and any reference to  the business, customers, employees,
confidential information, property, or  similar matters of the Employer shall
include the business, customers,  employees, confidential information,
property, or similar matters of Republic  and its affiliates as such matters
existed prior to the Effective  Date.

 

 

(b) _Enforcement. _ It  is the  desire and intent of the parties hereto
that the provisions of this Agreement  shall be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the laws and public  policies applied in each
jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, although the
Executive and the Employer consider the restrictions  contained in this
Agreement to be reasonable for the purpose of preserving  the  Employer's
goodwill and proprietary rights, if any particular provision of this 
Agreement shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, such
provision  shall be deemed amended to delete the portion thus adjudicated to
be invalid  or  unenforceable, such deletion to apply only with respect to
the operation  of such  provision in the particular jurisdiction in which
such adjudication is made.  It  is expressly understood and agreed that
although the Employer and the Executive  consider the restrictions contained
in Paragraph 9  to be  reasonable, if a final determination is made by a
court of competent  jurisdiction that the duration or territory or any other
restriction contained  in this Agreement is unenforceable against the
Executive, the provisions  of this  Agreement shall be deemed amended to
apply as to such maximum duration and  territory and to such maximum extent
as such court may judicially determine  or  indicate to be enforceable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-9-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) _Remedies;  Survival_.  The  parties acknowledge that the Employer's
damages at law would be an inadequate  remedy for the breach by the Executive
of any provision of Paragraph  9,  and  agree  in the event of such breach
that the Employer may obtain temporary and permanent  injunctive relief
restraining the Executive from such breach, and, to the  extent  permissible
under the applicable statutes and rules of procedure, a temporary  injunction
may be granted immediately upon the commencement of any such suit.  Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Employer from 
pursuing any other remedies available at law or equity for such breach or 
threatened breach of Paragraph 9,  or for  any breach or threatened breach
of any other provision of this Agreement.  The  obligations contained in
Paragraphs 9  through 13,  15,  and 16  shall  survive the termination
or expiration of the Executive's employment with the  Employer and, as
applicable, shall be fully enforceable thereafter in accordance  with the
terms of this Agreement.

 

 

(d) _Arbitration. _ Any  unresolved dispute or controversy arising under or
in connection with this  Agreement shall be settled exclusively by
arbitration, conducted in the state  in  which the Employer\'s main office
is located, in accordance with the Employment  Dispute Resolution Rules of
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")  then in  effect, provided that
the Executive and the Employer shall comply with the  Employer\'s grievance
procedures in an effort to resolve such dispute or  controversy before
resorting to arbitration, and provided further that the  parties may agree to
use an arbitrator other than those provided by the AAA.  The  arbitrator
shall not have the authority to add to, detract from, or modify  any 
provision hereof nor to award punitive damages to any injured party. A
decision  of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding. Judgment may
be entered  on  the arbitrator\'s award in any court having jurisdiction.
The direct expense  of  any arbitration proceeding shall be apportioned by
the arbitration  award.

 

 

**18. ****_Successor;  Binding Agreement_**.  The  Employer shall require
any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase,  merger,
consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially  all of 
the business and/or assets of the Employer to agree to assume and to assume 
all  of the obligations of the Employer under this Agreement upon or prior
to  such  succession taking place. A copy of such assumption and agreement
shall be  delivered to Executive promptly after its execution by the
successor. However,  this Agreement is personal to the Executive and the
Executive may not assign  or  transfer any part of his rights or duties
hereunder, or any compensation  due to  him hereunder, to any other person,
except that this Agreement shall inure  to  the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive\'s personal or legal  representatives,
executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees  or  beneficiaries.

 

 

**19. ****_Modification;  Waiver_** **.**   No  provision of this Agreement
may be modified, waived or discharged unless  such  waiver, modification or
discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the  Executive and by such
director of the Employer as may be specifically designated  by the Board.
Waiver by any party of any breach of or failure to comply with  any 
provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not be construed as, 
or  constitute waiver of such provision, or a waiver of any other breach
of,  or  failure to comply with, any other provision of this Agreement.

**TRUSTMARK  CORPORATION**

 

**TIME-VESTED  STOCK AGREEMENT**

 

   

 

**_Granted  _______, 2006_**

  

 

This  Time-Vested Stock Agreement is entered into on  ** __________** ,

WHEREAS,  the Company maintains the Plan under which the Committee (as
defined in the  Plan) may, among other things, award shares of the Company's
common stock  ("Stock") to such key associates of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (as defined  in the Plan) as the Committee may determine,
subject to such terms, conditions  and restrictions as it may deem
appropriate;

 



 

WHEREAS,  pursuant to the Plan, the Committee has granted to the Associate a
restricted  stock award conditioned upon the execution by the Company and the
Associate  of a  Time-Vested Stock Agreement setting forth all the terms and
conditions  applicable to such award; and

 



 

WHEREAS,  outside of the Plan and in addition to the restricted stock award
made pursuant  to the Plan, the Company has also agreed to make certain
Covenant Payments  to  the Associate subject to the terms and conditions
provided herein;

 



 

NOW  THEREFORE, in consideration of the benefits which the Company expects
to  be  derived from the services rendered to it and its Subsidiaries by the
Associate  and of the covenants contained herein, the parties hereby agree
as  follows:

 



 

1. _Award  of Shares_.  Under  the terms of the Plan, the Committee grants the Associate a restricted stock  award (the "Award") effective on **_________, _** 2006  ("Award Date"), covering ____________ shares of the Company's Stock (the "Award  Shares") subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions set forth in this  Agreement. 

 



 

 

 

2. _Period  of Restriction_.

-16-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. _Stock  Certificates_.  The  stock certificate(s) for the Award Shares shall be registered on the Company's  stock transfer books in the name of the Associate.

The  sale  or other transfer of the Shares of Stock represented by this
certificate,  whether voluntary, involuntary, or by operation of law, is
subject to certain  restrictions on transfer set forth in the Trustmark

Such dividends and other  distributions shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability  and  vesting as the Award Shares with respect to which they were paid and shall,  to  the extent vested, be paid when and to the extent the underlying Award Shares  are vested and freed of restrictions.

 



 

 

 

6. _Termination  of Employment and Forfeiture of Award Shares; and Covenant  Payments_.  

 

 

 



 

         |

during the Period of Restriction and prior to a Change in Control,  the 
Associate shall be entitled to receive the Covenant Payments .  Such

payroll  practices; provided, however, if the Covenants Payments are
considered  to  be nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of  the  Internal Revenue Code and if the Associate is a specified

employment relationship  with  the Company, any payment in connection with a
separation from service  payment event (as determined for purposes of Section
409A of the  Internal  Revenue Code) shall not be made until six months

deferred during the 409A Deferral Period, the payments  which  would
otherwise have been made in the 409A Deferral Period shall  be  accumulated
and paid in a lump sum as soon as the 409A Deferral  Period  ends, and the
balance of the payments shall be made as otherwise  scheduled_ _._   If the
Associate's employment ceases as described in this Section 6(b),  the
Associate is required to comply with the Covenant Obligations  herein; 
provided, however, that if the Associate's employment ceases after the 
occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) for  any such 
reason other than a termination by the Company for Cause, the Associate  is 
not required to comply with the Covenant Obligations herein.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, if the Associate  fails to  comply with the
Covenant Obligations, any and all remaining Covenant  Payments shall
automatically be forfeited to the Company; no Covenant  Payment shall be made
to the Associate pursuant hereto if the Release  attached hereto is not
