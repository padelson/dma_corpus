AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the
"Agreement"), dated as of May 1, 2002, by and among Level 3 Communications,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Eldorado Acquisition Three, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Purchaser"), and Software Spectrum, Inc., a Texas corporation (the
"Company"):   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company
(the "Board of Directors") has determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and the holders (the "Shareholders") of the shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (the "Common Stock") for Purchaser to
merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DGCL") and the Texas Business
Corporation Act ("TBCA") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;   WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and
Purchaser has determined that the Merger is in the best interests of Parent
and Purchaser, and the Merger has been approved by the sole stockholder of
Purchaser;   WHEREAS, immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger,
the parties desire to effect the Initial Transactions (as defined in Section
7.6);   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain Shareholders have entered
into Voting Agreements, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreement") pursuant to which each
such Shareholder has, among other things, agreed to grant to Parent a proxy
with respect to the voting of such shares, in each case upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement; and   WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors has approved this Agreement and the Voting Agreement
and has determined that the consideration to be paid for each share of Common
Stock (excluding the Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.7)) upon
consummation of the Merger is fair to the holders of such shares and has
resolved to recommend that the holders of Common Stock approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
of the foregoing premises, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:       ARTICLE I.  
THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with the DGCL and the TBCA, at the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall be merged into the Company and the separate
existence of Purchaser shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Texas.   SECTION 1.2. EFFECTIVE
TIME OF THE MERGER. On the Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser shall file
a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
and deliver articles of merger to the Secretary of State of the State of
Texas in accordance with the DGCL and TBCA and make all other filings or
recordings required by applicable law in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at the date and time (the "Effective Time")
when a properly executed certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and a certificate of merger is issued to the
Surviving Corporation by the Secretary of State of the State of Texas or at
such later time as is specified in the respective certificates of merger. The
certificates and articles of merger filed with the Secretary of States of the
States of Delaware and Texas are referred to throughout the remainder of this
Agreement as the "Certificates of Merger."   SECTION 1.3. ARTICLES OF
INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time the Second Restated Articles of
Incorporation ("Articles of Incorporation") of the Company, as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation upon and after the Effective Time until
thereafter amended as provided by law and such Articles of Incorporation.  
SECTION 1.4. BY-LAWS. The By-laws of Purchaser as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.   SECTION 1.5.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS; OFFICERS. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.   SECTION 1.6. EFFECTS
OF MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of DGCL and TBCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.7. CLOSING. The closing
of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at
the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher, 787 Seventh Avenue, New    
-2-   York, NY 10019 no later than 10:00 a.m. on the second business day
(as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1 under the Exchange Act (a "Business
Day")) after the conditions set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied
(or, to the extent permitted by law, waived by the parties entitled to the
benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed
between Parent and the Company (the "Closing Date").   ARTICLE II.  
CONVERSION OF COMMON STOCK   SECTION 2.1. CONVERSION OF COMMON STOCK. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Shareholder:   (a) All shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by the Company  or any
Subsidiary of the Company, and any shares of Common Stock issued  and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time owned by  Parent,
Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent, shall be cancelled  and
extinguished and no payment or other consideration shall be made  with
respect thereto. As used in this Agreement, "Subsidiary" means any 
"subsidiary" as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities  Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").   (b) Each remaining share of
Common Stock issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than  Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be cancelled and
extinguished  and be converted into and become solely a right to receive
$37.00 per  share (the "Per Share Amount") in cash payable to the holder
thereof,  without interest, upon surrender of the certificate representing
such  share. From and after the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate  or certificates representing any such shares of Common Stock
shall  cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to 
receive the Per Share Amount, without interest, upon the surrender of  such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof.   (c) Each share of
capital stock of Purchaser issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted  and exchanged into one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable  share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   SECTION 2.2. STOCK OPTIONS   (a) Prior to the consummation
of the Merger, the Company shall  take all actions necessary, and obtain any
required consents, to  provide that, (i) effective as of the Effective Time
each then  outstanding option to purchase Common Stock granted under any of
the  Company\'s stock option plans referred to in Section 4.5
(collectively,  the "Option Plans"), and (ii) any and all other outstanding
options,  stock warrants and rights to acquire Common Stock, whether or not 
granted pursuant to such Option Plans, whether or not then exercisable  or
vested (the "Options") shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger,  shall
cease to exist and shall be of no further force or effect;  provided,    
-3-    however, that each holder of an Option, whether vested or
unvested,  shall be entitled to receive, for each share of Common Stock
issuable  on exercise of such Option, an amount in cash equal to the excess
of  (x) the Per Share Amount over (y) the per share exercise price of the 
Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such  amount
shall be subject to reduction by any applicable tax withholding.  The Company
and Parent agree that such amounts are the sole payments  that will be made
with respect to or in relation to the Options. No  consideration shall be
payable with respect to any Option which has an  exercise price that exceeds
the Per Share Amount.   (b) The consideration due under this Section 2.2
shall be  payable as soon as practicable after the Effective Time without 
interest after (x) verification by the Paying Agent of the ownership  and
terms of the particular Option by reference to the Company\'s  records, and
(y) delivery in the manner provided in Section 2.4 of a  written instrument
duly executed by the owner of the applicable Option,  in a form provided by
the Paying Agent and setting forth (i) the  aggregate number of Options owned
by that person and their respective  issue dates and exercise prices, (ii) a
representation by the person  that he or she is the owner of all Options
described pursuant to clause  (x), that none of those Options has expired or
ceased to be exercisable  prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) a consent to
the treatment of  such Options pursuant to this Section 2.2 in full
satisfaction of all  rights relating to such Options.   (c) Except as
provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the  parties, the Company shall
cause the Option Plans to terminate  effective not later than the Effective
Time, and the provisions in any  other plan, program or arrangement,
providing for the issuance or grant  by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any interest in respect of  the capital stock of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be  terminated effective not later than the
Effective Time.   (d) The Company represents and warrants that all of the
Option  Plans provide that the Company can take the actions described in
this  Section 2.2 without obtaining the consent of any holders of
Options.   (e) The Company shall take any reasonable action required to 
cause the disposition of the Options in accordance with this Section  2.2 to
be exempt from the provisions of 16(b) of the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, including the rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder
(the "Exchange Act").   (f) Pursuant to the terms of the Company\'s Non-
Employee  Directors\' Retainer Stock Plan, all share equivalents credited
to  participant deferral accounts shall be cancelled in exchange for an 
amount in cash equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied by the  equivalents
so cancelled. The Company shall pay such amount as soon as  practicable after
the Effective Time.   SECTION 2.3. CLOSING OF COMPANY TRANSFER BOOKS. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no further transfer of such Common Stock shall thereafter
be made on such stock transfer books. If, after the Effective Time,
valid     -4-   certificates previously representing such Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 2.4.   SECTION 2.4. EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank
or trust company with capital exceeding $500 million to act as agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the Shareholders to receive the funds necessary to effect
the exchange for cash of certificates which, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented Common Stock entitled to payment pursuant to
Section 2.1(b). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying
Agent shall mail a transmittal form to each holder of record of certificates
theretofore representing such Common Stock advising such holder of the
procedure for surrendering to the Paying Agent such certificates. If a
check or wire transfer for the Per Share Amount is to be issued in the name
of any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, association, limited
liability company, Governmental Agency or any other entity (each, a "Person")
other than the Person in whose name the certificates for Common Stock
surrendered for exchange are registered on the books of the Company, it shall
be a condition of the exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Paying Agent all transfer or other taxes, if any, required by
reason of the issuance of such check or wire transfer in the name of a Person
other than the registered owner of the certificates surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. Upon the surrender and exchange of a certificate
theretofore representing Common Stock, the holder shall be paid by check or
wire transfer, without interest thereon, the Per Share Amount to which such
holder is entitled hereunder, less only such amount, if any, required to be
withheld under applicable backup withholding federal income tax regulations,
and such certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered and
exchanged, each such certificate shall represent solely the right to receive
the Per Share Amount into which the Common Stock it theretofore represented
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1, without interest, and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay the holder thereof the Per
Share Amount to which such holder otherwise would be entitled. If any
certificates representing any Common Stock shall not have been surrendered
prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any payment in respect thereof would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Agency), the payment in respect
of such certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a
holder of certificates theretofore representing Common Stock for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. In the event that any holder is unable to deliver
the certificate which formerly represented such holder\'s Common Stock, then
Parent or Purchaser, in the absence of actual notice that any Common Stock
represented by any such certificate has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, shall deliver to such holder the Per Share Amount to
which Shareholder is entitled in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement upon the presentation of the following: (i) an affidavit or other
evidence that the certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed;
(ii) evidence that such Person is the beneficial owner of the certificate
claimed by such Person to be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that
such Person is the person who would be entitled to present such certificate
for exchange pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) reasonable indemnity
against the claims of any third party claiming to be the beneficial owner of
such lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed certificate.     -5-   
SECTION 2.5. FUNDING OF PAYING AGENT.   (a) Parent shall provide or cause to
be provided to Purchaser,  and Purchaser shall transmit by wire transfer, or
other acceptable  means to the Paying Agent, at or prior to the Effective
Time funds  required for the exchange of all Common Stock and cancellation of
all  Options in accordance with this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall
agree  to hold such funds in trust and deliver such funds (in the form of 
checks of the Paying Agent or wire transfers) in accordance with this 
Section 2.5 and Sections 2.2 and 2.4. Any portion of such funds which  has
not been paid to holders of the Common Stock or Options pursuant to  Section
2.2 or 2.4 within six months after the Effective Time shall  promptly be paid
to the party which provided such funds, and thereafter  holders of
certificates representing the right to receive the cash into  which Common
Stock or Options formerly represented by such certificates  shall have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or 2.2 who have  not theretofore
complied with Section 2.2 or 2.4 shall look solely to  the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the amount of cash to which  they are entitled
pursuant to this Agreement.   (b) The Paying Agent shall invest the funds,
as directed by  Purchaser, prior to the Effective Time, and as directed by
the  Surviving Corporation, on or after the Effective Time, in (i) direct 
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which  the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to  provide
for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial  paper rated the
highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors Services,  Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation or (iv) certificates of deposit,  bank repurchase
agreements or bankers\' acceptances of commercial banks  with capital
exceeding $500 million. Any net earnings with respect to  the funds shall be
the property of and paid over to the Surviving  Corporation as and when
requested by the Surviving Corporation;  provided, however, that any such
investment or any such payment of  earnings may not delay the receipt by
holders of certificates of any  Per Share Amount.   SECTION 2.6. NO FURTHER
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMMON STOCK. From and after the Effective Time, the
Shareholders shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Common Stock
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by any federal, state,
local, municipal, foreign, international, multinational, or other Order,
constitution, law, rule, ordinance, permit, principle of common law,
regulation, statute, or treaty (each, a "Legal Requirement"). All cash
paid upon the surrender of certificates in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to Common Stock. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Order"
means any award, decision, injunction, judgment, order, ruling, subpoena, or
verdict entered, issued, made, or rendered by any Governmental Agency.  
SECTION 2.7. DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by Shareholders who (i) have not voted such shares in favor of the Merger,
(ii) have otherwise complied with the relevant provisions of Section 5.13 of
the TBCA and (iii) as of the Effective Time, shall not have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right to relief as a dissenting Shareholder
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to    
-6-  receive the Per Share Amount described in Section 2.1(b). The holders
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 5.13
of the TBCA. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment
for such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 5.13 of the TBCA shall receive
payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the TBCA;
provided, however, that if any such holder of Dissenting Shares (i) shall
have failed to establish his entitlement to relief as a dissenting
Shareholder as provided in Section 5.13 of the TBCA, (ii) shall have
withdrawn his demand for relief as a dissenting Shareholder with respect to
such Dissenting Shares or lost his right to relief as a dissenting
Shareholder and payment for his Dissenting Shares under Section 5.13 of the
TBCA or (iii) shall have failed to file a complaint with the appropriate
court seeking relief as to determination of the value of all Dissenting
Shares within the time provided in Section 5.13 of the TBCA, such holder
shall forfeit the right to relief as a dissenting Shareholder with respect to

RESPECT TO THE MERGER   SECTION 3.1. COMPANY AND BOARD APPROVAL; FAIRNESS
OPINION.   (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Merger 
and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors, at a meeting  duly
called and held on May 1, 2002, at which all the Directors were  present duly
and unanimously: (i) approved and adopted this Agreement  and the
Transactions, including the Merger, (ii) resolved to recommend  that the
Shareholders approve this Agreement and the Transactions,  including the
Merger, provided that such recommendation may be  withdrawn, modified or
amended to the extent that the Board of  Directors determines in good faith
following consultation with outside  legal counsel that failure to take such
action would constitute a  breach of the Board of Directors\' fiduciary
obligations under  applicable law, (iii) determined that this Agreement and
the  transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are fair to
and  in the best interests of the Shareholders, (iv) took all action 
necessary to render Section 13.03 of the TBCA and the Rights  inapplicable to
the     -7-    Merger, the Voting Agreement, this Agreement, and any of
the  Transactions and Subsequent Transactions, (v) elected, to the extent 
permitted by law, not to be subject to any "moratorium," "control share 
acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of 
corporate anti-takeover laws and regulations of any jurisdiction that  may
purport to be applicable to this Agreement, and (vi) approved the  execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, such approval  constituting
approval of the foregoing for purposes of Section 5.03 of  the TBCA.   (b)
The Company further represents and warrants that SunTrust  Robinson Humphrey,
as financial advisor to the Board of Directors has  delivered to the Board of
Directors a written opinion, dated as of the  date of this Agreement (or an
oral opinion which will be promptly  confirmed in writing), to the effect
that the Per Share Amount to be  received by Shareholders (other than Parent
or any "affiliate" as  defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities
Act ("Affiliate"))  pursuant to the Merger is fair to such holders from a
financial point  of view. The Company hereby represents and warrants that it
has been  authorized by its financial advisor to permit the inclusion in
its  entirety of the fairness opinion (and, subject to prior review and 
consent by the financial advisor, references thereto) in the Proxy 
Statement. The Company has been advised by each of its directors who  owns
shares of Common Stock that such person intends to vote all shares  of Common
Stock owned by such person in favor of the Merger.   (c) The Company has
irrevocably taken all necessary action,  including, without limitation,
amending the Rights Agreement, dated as  of December 13, 1996, as amended,
between the Company and Mellon  Investor Services, LLC, as rights agent (the
"Rights Agreement"), with  respect to all of the outstanding rights issued
pursuant to the Rights  Agreement (the "Rights") to ensure that (i) Parent
and Purchaser, or  either of them, are not deemed to be an Acquiring Person
(as defined in  the Rights Agreement) and (ii) the Rights will not become
exercisable,  in any such case, by reason of the execution and delivery of
the Voting  Agreement, this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and
the  Subsequent Transactions. The Rights Agreement, as so amended, has not 
been further amended or modified. Copies of all such amendments to the 
Rights Agreement have been previously provided or made available to 
Purchaser.   SECTION 3.2. PROXY STATEMENT.   (a) As promptly as
practicable following the date of this  Agreement, the Company shall prepare
a preliminary proxy statement (the  "Proxy Statement") relating to the
Special Meeting and a form of proxy  for use at the Special Meeting relating
to the vote of the Shareholders  with respect to the Merger. Parent shall be
afforded a reasonable  opportunity to comment on the Proxy Statement. The
Proxy Statement  shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of
the  Exchange Act, and shall be in form and substance reasonably 
satisfactory to Parent.   (b) The Company shall cause the preliminary Proxy
Statement to  be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission")  at the earliest practicable date after the date of this
Agreement, and  in any event not more than 14 days after the date
hereof.     -8-    (c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the
receipt of  any comments of the Commission with respect to the preliminary
Proxy  Statement and of any requests by the Commission for any amendment or 
supplement thereto or for additional information and shall provide to  Parent
promptly copies of all correspondence between the Company or any 
representative of the Company and the Commission. As promptly as  practicable
after comments are received from the Commission with  respect to the
preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall use its  commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the  Commission and, to the
extent comments of the Commission relate to  Parent or Purchaser, Parent and
Purchaser shall use their commercially  reasonable efforts to respond to the
comments of the Commission. The  Company shall give Parent and its counsel
the reasonable opportunity to  review all amendments and supplements to the
Proxy Statement and all  responses to requests for additional information and
replies to  comments of the Commission prior to their being filed with or
sent to  the Commission, and Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company
with  such information about them as may be required to be included in the 
Proxy Statement or as may be reasonably required to respond to any  comment
of the Commission.   (d) After all the comments received from the Commission
have  been cleared by the Commission staff and all information required to
be  contained in the Proxy Statement has been included therein by the 
Company, the Company shall file with the Commission the definitive  Proxy
Statement and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable  efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the Commission as soon  thereafter as
practicable. The definitive Proxy Statement shall contain  the fairness
opinion of the financial advisor for the Company pursuant  to Section 3.1(b).
The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be  mailed to record holders
of the Common Stock as promptly as practicable  after clearance by the
Commission.   (e) The Proxy Statement shall contain the determination and 
recommendation of the Board of Directors referred to in and subject to 
Section 3.1; provided, however, that any withdrawal or change in its 
recommendation must be made in compliance with Section 6.2(c), if 
applicable, and subject to the requirement that the Board of Directors 
submit this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, to a 
shareholder vote in accordance with Section 3.3(c).   (f) The Company shall
prepare and revise the Proxy Statement  so that, at the date mailed to the
Shareholders, at the time of the  Special Meeting, and at the Closing Date
the Proxy Statement shall (x)  not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state  any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order  that the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under  which they are made, not misleading (except that the
Company shall not  be responsible under this paragraph with respect to
statements made  therein based on information supplied by Parent or Purchaser
expressly  for inclusion in the Proxy Statement), and (y) comply in all
material  respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and  regulations thereunder.     -9-    SECTION 3.3. MEETING OF
SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY.   (a) The Company shall promptly take all
action necessary in  accordance with the TBCA and its Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws  to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of its  shareholders for the purpose of considering and
taking action upon the  approval of the Merger and the authorization and
adoption of this  Agreement (the "Special Meeting") as promptly as
practicable following  the date hereof, and in no event more than 21 Business
Days following  the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the Commission.  
(b) The vote required for approval of the Merger will be  two-thirds or more
of the outstanding Common Stock. Subject to the  right of the Board of
Directors to withdraw, modify or amend its  recommendation of the Merger in
accordance with Section 3.1(a), the  Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from  Shareholders proxies in favor of the Merger and
shall take all other  action necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of
Purchaser, advisable  to secure any vote of Shareholders required by the TBCA
and the  Articles of Incorporation to effect the Merger.   (c) The Company
shall call and hold the Special Meeting  whether or not the Board of
Directors at any time subsequent to the  date hereof determines that this
Agreement or the Transactions,  including the Merger, is no longer advisable,
recommends the rejection  thereof by the Shareholders, or otherwise makes an
Adverse  Recommendation.   (d) At the Special Meeting, Parent and Purchaser
shall vote or  cause to be voted all of the Common Stock then owned or as to
which  they have voting control by Parent, Purchaser or their Subsidiaries
in  favor of adoption of this Agreement and the Company shall vote or cause 
to be voted all shares of Common Stock with respect to which proxies in  the
form distributed by the Company have been given, and not voted  against the
adoption of this Agreement, in favor of adoption of this  Agreement.  
ARTICLE IV.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as of the date of this
Agreement as follows:   SECTION 4.1. ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY.   (a)
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation  duly organized,
validly existing, and except as set forth on Schedule  4.1 in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its  organization. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries is duly  qualified to do business and is in good
standing in the states in which  the ownership of its properties or the
conduct of its business requires  such qualification, except where the
failure to so qualify,  individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to  have a Prohibited Effect.     -10-    (b)
For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Prohibited Effect"  means: (i) a
material adverse change in or effect with respect to the  business, revenues,
results of operations, properties, or financial  condition of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other  than any change or effect
resulting from or attributable to (A) the  announcement or pendency of this
Agreement or the Transactions, (B) any  decrease in the market price of the
Common Stock (but not any change or  effect underlying such decrease to the
extent that it would otherwise  constitute a Prohibited Effect), (C) changes,
effects, conditions,  events or circumstances that generally affect the
industries in which  the Company or its Subsidiaries operate (including legal
and regulatory  changes), or (D) general economic conditions or changes,
effects,  conditions or circumstances affecting the securities markets
generally,  including any change in general economic conditions due to any
act or  war, terrorism, or threat of war or terrorism; or (ii) notice from
a  Major Supplier after the date of this Agreement that it intends to 
materially alter its relationship with the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries in a manner that would be materially adverse to the  Company\'s
business taken as a whole other than any such notice arising  directly from a
request to amend or delete provisions of Contracts  designated as Vendor
Excluded Indebtedness pursuant to Section 7.6.   SECTION 4.2. AUTHORITY AND
BINDING EFFECT.   (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power to
execute  and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents 
contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith to which it is a 
party (the "Transaction Documents") and subject, with respect to the 
consummation of the Merger, to the approval of Shareholders holding at  least
two-thirds of the outstanding Common Stock, to consummate the  Initial
Transactions, the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated hereby and
thereby (collectively, the "Transactions"), and  to consummate the subsequent
merger of Parent\'s wholly owned subsidiary  engaged in the same line of
business with and into the Surviving  Corporation (the "Subsequent
Transactions").   (b) The execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents by  the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions  have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors, and no  other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to  authorize Transaction Documents or to consummate the
Transactions  (other than with respect to the consummation of the Merger,
the  adoption of this Agreement by Shareholders holding at least two-thirds 
of the outstanding Common Stock).   (c) This Agreement has been, and each
other Transaction  Document at the time of its execution will have been, duly
and validly  executed and delivered by the Company, and (assuming this
Agreement and  such Transaction Documents each constitute a valid and
binding  obligation of Parent and Purchaser) this Agreement constitutes,
and  each such other Transaction Document at the time of execution will 
constitute, the valid and binding obligations of the Company,  enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,  insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization,     -11-    moratorium and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or  affecting the rights of creditors and
to general principles of equity.   SECTION 4.3. NO CONFLICT OR VIOLATION;
CONSENTS. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3, neither the execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents nor the consummation or performance of

(i)  any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or the Second Amended

organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any  resolution

subject;   (c) contravene, or conflict with, or result in a violation of 
any of the terms or requirements of, or give any Governmental Agency  the

Subsidiaries;   (d) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or

material  Legal Requirement, or (ii) any actual, alleged, possible, or
potential  obligation on the part of the Company to undertake, or to bear all
or  any portion of the cost of, any material remedial action of any nature,

(collectively,  the "Company Representatives") to immediately as of the date
of this  Agreement cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons
that  may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall 
not, and shall not authorize or permit any Company Representative to,  (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, directly or indirectly (including  by way of
furnishing information), or take any other action to  facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal which  constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Takeover  Proposal; (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding  any Takeover Proposal; or
(iii)     -33-    enter into any agreement with respect to any Takeover
Proposal;  provided, however, that, if at any time prior to the Effective
Time,  the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation 
with its outside legal counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order  to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal  Requirements, the
Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide  Superior Proposal, and
subject to compliance with Section 6.2(b), (x)  furnish information
concerning its business, properties or assets to  any Person pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with terms and  conditions similar to the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 9,  2002 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") between the Company and Parent  (provided that such
confidentiality agreement may not include any  provision granting any such
Person an exclusive right to negotiate with  the Company) and (y) participate
in negotiations regarding such  Superior Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood  that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the preceding  sentence by any Company Representative shall be deemed to
be a breach  of this Section 6.2(a) by the Company. The Company shall not
release  any Third Party from, or waive any provision of, any such 
confidentiality agreement or any other similar confidentiality or  standstill
agreement to which the Company is a party. "Third Party"  means any Person or
group other than Parent, Purchaser or any Affiliate  thereof.   (b) In
addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in  paragraph (a) of
this Section 6.2, the Company shall promptly advise  Parent orally and in
writing of any request for information, proposal,  discussion, negotiation or
inquiry received after the date of this  Agreement in connection with any
Takeover Proposal and the Company will  promptly (but in any event within one
Business Day) communicate to  Parent the material terms and conditions of any
such proposal,  discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it may receive (and
will  promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials received
by  the Company in connection with such proposal, discussion, negotiation 
or inquiry) and the identity of the Person making such proposal or  inquiry
or engaging in such discussions or negotiation. The Company  will promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning  the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries provided to any other Person  which was not previously
provided to Parent. The Company will keep  Parent informed of the status and
material details (including  amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
Takeover Proposal.   (c) If the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof  intends: (i) to approve or recommend, or propose to approve or 
recommend, any Superior Proposal; or (ii) to cause the Company to enter  into
any agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal (other than  any
confidentiality agreement as contemplated by Section 6.2(a)), (a  "Competing
Agreement"), then at least five Business Days prior to  taking such action:
(A) the Company shall provide Parent with written  notice advising Parent
that the Board of Directors has received a  Superior Proposal that it intends
to accept, specifying the material  terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the  Person or Persons making such Superior
Proposal, and (B) the Company  shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, negotiate  in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments in
the terms and  conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed  with the Transactions on such adjusted terms. If following the 
completion of such five Business Day period the Company and Parent have  been
unable to agree upon     -34-    such adjustment in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would  enable the Company to proceed with the
Transactions, then, after  compliance with the Escrow Procedures, the Board
of Directors or any  committee thereof may: (i) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve  or recommend, such Superior Proposal; or (ii) cause the
Company to  enter into a Competing Agreement with respect to such Superior 
Proposal. So long as any Competing Agreement expressly provides that  the
existence of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its 
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Transactions shall  not
constitute a breach or default under the Competing Agreement, then  the
existence of the Competing Agreement and the performance by the  Company of
its obligations thereunder relating to the Superior  Proposal, the
consummation of the Superior Proposal and the amendment  of the Rights Plan
in connection with the Competing Agreement shall not  be deemed to be a
breach or default under this Agreement. Subject to  compliance with the
Escrow Procedures, if required by the second  preceding sentence, nothing
contained in this Section 6.2 shall  prohibit the Company or the Board of
Directors from taking and  disclosing to the Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)  promulgated under the Exchange Act.   (d)
"Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer  from any Third
Party, whether in writing or otherwise, relating to any  "Alternative
Transaction", which is defined as any one of the following  transactions with
or by a Third Party: (A) merger, consolidation or  similar transaction
involving the Company, (B) sale, lease or other  disposition directly or
indirectly by merger, consolidation, tender  offer, share exchange or
otherwise of assets of the Company or its  Subsidiaries representing 10% or
more of the consolidated assets of the  Company and its Subsidiaries, (C)
issue, sale, or other disposition of  (including by way of merger,
consolidation, tender offer, share  exchange or any similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or  warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into, such securities)  representing 10% or more of the voting
power of the Company or (D)  transaction in which any Person shall acquire
beneficial ownership (as  such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act), or the  right to acquire beneficial ownership or any "group"
(as such term is  defined under the Exchange Act) shall have been formed
which  beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership
of  15% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, in each case for avoidance 
of doubt, other than the transactions with Parent contemplated by this 
Agreement, and except for any Person that beneficially owns more than  15% of
the outstanding Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement,  unless such
Person\'s beneficial ownership increases by more than 1% of  the outstanding
Common Stock; provided that the term "Alternative  Transaction" shall not
include sales of products and services in the  ordinary course of business,
and following termination of this  Agreement, shall not include any
acquisition of securities by an  underwriter or broker-dealer in connection
with a bona fide public  offering of such securities.   (e) "Superior
Proposal" means any bona fide written offer for  an Alternative Transaction
(i) by a Third Party that the Board of  Directors determines in its good
faith judgment has the good faith  intent to proceed with negotiations, (ii)
for all outstanding shares of  Common Stock, (iii) that would provide the
Shareholders the right to  receive a     -35-    higher per share
consideration than the Per Share Amount, payable in  cash or marketable
securities, (iv) on terms which the Board of  Directors determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation  with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) are more  favorable to the Shareholders
than the Merger from a financial point of  view and (v) that the Board of
Directors determines in good faith  judgment is reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account  all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal.   (f) "Escrow Procedures" means that the Company
shall have  performed the following:   (i) the Company shall have entered
into an escrow  agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to 
Parent, with an escrow agent reasonably satisfactory to  Parent, providing
for among other things: (A) the deposit into  the escrow account by the
Company of $6 million, (B) the  release of such escrowed funds to Parent, to
the extent Parent  is entitled thereto pursuant to Section 9.3, upon notice
from  Parent to the escrow agent that Parent has terminated this  Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(e)(ii)(A) or (B)(x), and (C)  the release of such
funds to the Company (or its designee) or  Parent to the extent Parent is
entitled thereto pursuant to  Section 9.3, upon evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the  escrow agent of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  any other provision of this Agreement.   (ii) the Company
shall have deposited $6 million with  the escrow agent.   SECTION 6.3.
RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Except for the amendments contemplated by Section 3.1(c)
hereof or amendments approved in writing by Parent or Purchaser, the Company
shall not, from and after the date of this Agreement, amend the Rights
Agreement in any manner. In addition the Company covenants and agrees that it
shall not redeem the Rights unless such redemption is consented to in writing
by Parent prior to such redemption or unless it is ordered to do so by a
court of competent jurisdiction.   SECTION 6.4. ACCESS AND INFORMATION. From
the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall (a) afford to Parent and Purchaser and their accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access at all reasonable times
(and at such other times as the parties may mutually agree) and upon
reasonable notice to all of their properties, books, contracts, commitments,
records and personnel, and (b) during such period, furnish promptly to Parent
and Purchaser (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
received by it or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities laws, and (ii) all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.
Nothing in this Section 6.4 shall require the Company to provide access to or
disclose information where such access or disclosure would conflict with
applicable laws or result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege;
provided that, with respect to any such information subject to attorney-
client privilege, the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to disclose or
provide access to such information or to substantively equivalent or similar
information in a manner that will not result in the loss of
such privilege.     -36-   Parent shall hold, and shall cause its
employees and agents to hold, in confidence all such information in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION 6.5.
NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS.   (a) The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent of (i) the  occurrence, or non-occurrence of any event whose
occurrence, or  non-occurrence would be likely to cause either (A) any

to the  Effective Time or (B) any condition set forth in Article VIII to be 
unsatisfied in any material respect at any time from the date of this

Company of (i) the  occurrence, or non-occurrence of any event whose

to the  Effective Time or (ii) any action, proceeding, injunction or other 
order, decree, judgment or ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction  or by

however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant  to this Section 6.5(b)
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies  available hereunder to the
Company.   SECTION 6.6. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. From and after the
date of this Agreement, no further purchases of Common Stock shall occur
under the Company\'s Second Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "Employee Stock Purchase Plan") nor shall any issuances of rights to

made with payroll deductions taken prior to the date of this Agreement.  
ARTICLE VII.   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 7.1. INDEMNIFICATION OF
COMPANY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.   (a) The Company shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under  applicable law and regardless of whether the Merger
is consummated,  indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and after the Effective
Time, the  Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under  applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the
present     -37-    and former officers and directors of the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), from
and  against, and pay or reimburse the Indemnified Parties for, all losses, 
obligations, expenses, claims (and involving claims by or in the right  of
the Company), damages or liabilities resulting from third-party  claims and
including interest, penalties, out-of-pocket expenses and  attorneys\' fees
incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the  same or in asserting
any of their rights hereunder resulting from or  arising out of actions or
omissions of such Indemnified Parties as  officers or directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  occurring on or prior to the Effective
Time (including, without  limitation, the Transactions) to the fullest extent
permitted or  required under (i)(A) the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws
of the  Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, including, without 
limitation, provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the 
defense of any action or suit, or (B) any indemnification agreement  between
the Indemnified Party and the Company in effect immediately  prior to the
date of this Agreement; and (ii) advance to any  Indemnified Parties expenses
incurred in defending any action or suit  with respect to such matters, in
each case to the extent such  Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification or advancement of  expenses under the Company\'s Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws in  effect on the date of this Agreement and
subject to the terms of such  Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws.   (b)
Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification  under Section 7.1(a)
shall provide notice to the Surviving Corporation  promptly after such
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim  as to which indemnity
may be sought, and the Indemnified Party shall  permit the Surviving
Corporation (at its expense) to assume the defense  of any claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom; provided, however,  that (i) counsel for the
Surviving Corporation who shall conduct the  defense of such claim or
litigation shall be reasonably satisfactory to  the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnified Party may participate in such  defense at such Indemnified
Party\'s expense, and (ii) the omission by  any Indemnified Party to give
notice as provided herein shall not  relieve the Surviving Corporation of its
indemnification obligation  under this Agreement, except to the extent that
such omission results  in a failure of actual notice to the Surviving
Corporation, and the  Surviving Corporation is actually prejudiced as a
result of such  failure to give notice. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation  does not accept the defense of any matter as above provided,
the  Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the 
Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of one  such
counsel for all the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements  therefor are
received; provided, however, that the Surviving  Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its  prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld); provided, further, however,
that the Surviving Corporation  shall not be responsible for the fees and
expenses of more than one  counsel for all of the Indemnified Parties unless
there is, under  applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
between the  positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case
each  Indemnified Party with respect to whom such a conflict exists (or
group  of such Indemnified Parties who among them have no such conflict)
may  retain one separate law firm in each applicable jurisdiction and the 
Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of  each
such counsel. In any event, the     -38-    Surviving Corporation and
the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in  the defense of any action or
claim. The Surviving Corporation shall  not, in the defense of any such claim
or litigation, except with the  consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to
entry of any judgment or  enter into any settlement that provides for
injunctive or other  nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party or
that does not  include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or  plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability  with respect to such claim or litigation.   (c) The articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving  Corporation shall contain the
provisions with respect to  indemnification set forth in the Company\'s
Articles of Incorporation  and By-Laws, which provisions shall not be
amended, modified or  otherwise repealed for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in  any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder as of the  Effective Time of individuals who at the Effective Time
were directors  or officers of the Company, unless such modification is
required after  the Effective Time by law and then only to the minimum extent
required  by such law.   (d) This Section 7.1 is intended for the benefit
of, and to  grant third party rights to, persons entitled to indemnification
under  this Section 7.1 whether or not parties to this Agreement, and each
of  such persons shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in 
this Section 7.1.   (e) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in
all  respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to indemnification 
agreements and employment agreements with the Company\'s directors and 
officers existing at or immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (f) In
addition, Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving  Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than three years after  the Effective Time,
the Company\'s current directors and officers (as  defined to mean those
person insured under such policy) with an  insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events  occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the "DandO; Insurance") in an  aggregate amount of at least
$15,000,000, and that is in the aggregate  not materially less favorable than
the existing policy or, if  substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best  available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and
the Surviving  Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO;  Insurance in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
the  Company for such insurance, but in such case shall purchase as much of 
such coverage as possible for such amount.   SECTION 7.2. HSR ACT; FOREIGN
FILINGS. The Company and Parent shall use their best efforts to file as soon
as practicable notifications under the HSR Act and under any applicable
foreign antitrust laws in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and to respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries received from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice or any applicable foreign governmental
antitrust authority for additional information or documentation and to
respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests
received from any State Attorney General or other Governmental Agency in
connection with antitrust matters.     -39-    SECTION 7.3. ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS REGARDING CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each  of the parties hereto agrees to use all
reasonable best efforts to  take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done,  all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Legal  Requirements to consummate and make effective the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, including using all reasonable
best  efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals, to 
effect all necessary registrations and filings (including, but not  limited
to, filings under the HSR Act and with all applicable  Governmental Agencies,
including foreign antitrust authorities) and to  lift any injunction or other
legal bar to the Merger (and, in such  case, to proceed with the Merger as
expeditiously as possible) subject  to the appropriate vote of the
Shareholders. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, (i) without Parent\'s prior
written consent, the Company  shall not obtain any consent that will affect
Parent or the Company or  any of their respective Subsidiaries to the
economic detriment of any  of them in any material way (other than payments
permitted pursuant to  Section 6.1(l)), including any material modification
of any Material  Contract or material Permit and (ii) neither Parent nor
Purchaser shall  be obligated to dispose of or forfeit material incidents of
control of  all or any material portion of the business or assets of the
Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, or to divest, hold separate, or place in
trust  all or any portion of its assets or businesses or those of any of
its  Subsidiaries or those of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to 
incur a Prohibited Result. Each party shall promptly inform the other  party
of any communication with, and any proposed understanding,  undertaking, or
agreement with, any Governmental Agency regarding any  such filings or any
such transaction. Neither party shall participate  in any meeting with any
Governmental Agency in respect of any such  filings, investigation, or other
inquiry without giving the other party  notice of the meeting and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental  Agency, the opportunity to attend and
participate.   (b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation,  execution and filing of all returns, applications or other
documents  regarding any real property transfer, stamp, recording,
documentary or  other Taxes and any other fees and similar Taxes which become
payable  in connection with the Merger.   SECTION 7.4. EFFORTS; FURTHER
ASSURANCES.   (a) Parent and Purchaser on the one hand, and the Company,
on  the other (i) shall not take any action that would reasonably be 
expected to cause any of their respective representations and  warranties in
this Agreement not to remain materially true and  materially correct and (ii)
shall use their respective reasonable best  efforts to cause each of their
respective representations and  warranties in this Agreement to be materially
true and materially  correct as of the Closing Date.   (b) In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further  action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this  Agreement, the proper officers and/or
directors of Parent and the  Surviving Corporation shall take all such
necessary action.     -40-    SECTION 7.5. TAKEOVER STATUTES. If any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination," or "fair
price" statute or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto
and the members of the Board of Directors shall, to the extent consistent
with applicable Legal Requirements, grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of
such statute or regulations on the transactions contemplated hereby.  
SECTION 7.6. INITIAL TRANSACTIONS.   (a) Upon the request of Parent, the
Company shall furnish to  Parent its reasonable, good faith estimate of the
amount that the  Company will be required to pay pursuant to Section
7.6(b)(i) and (ii)  and of cash on hand of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on the Closing  Date.   (b) At such time as all of the conditions set forth
in Article  VIII, other than Section 8.2(f), shall have been satisfied or 
irrevocably waived by Parent (the "Initial Transaction Time"), the  Company
shall:   (i) repay all Indebtedness for borrowed money of the  Company and
its Subsidiaries (other than Vendor Excluded  Indebtedness), including such
Indebtedness under Contracts set  forth on Schedule 4.12, and terminate all
of its obligations  under the Contracts governing such Indebtedness which if
not  terminated would cause a default under Parent\'s senior credit 
facility upon the occurrence of the Effective Time;   (ii) cash
collateralize all outstanding letters of  credit on terms and conditions
reasonably satisfactory to  Parent;   (iii) contribute to a newly formed
entity, formed in  a non-U.S. jurisdiction reasonably acceptable to Parent,
for  which a "check the box" election has been made for U.S. income  tax
purposes, and that is wholly owned by the Company ("New  LLC") all of the
outstanding capital stock of each of the  Company\'s Subsidiaries listed in
Schedule 7.6(b)(iii) (the  "Foreign Subsidiary Stock"), such that immediately
following  such contribution all of the Company\'s Subsidiaries that are 
organized in a jurisdiction outside of the United States shall  be wholly
owned, directly or indirectly, by New LLC.   (iv) sell to Purchaser all of
the membership  interests in New LLC for their book value (the "New LLC 
Purchase Price"), subject to the requirement that the  Surviving Corporation
purchase all of the Foreign Subsidiary  Stock from New LLC immediately
following the Effective Time  for a purchase price equal to the New LLC
Purchase Price, plus  interest thereon from and after the Foreign Subsidiary
Sale at  the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum. The Company shall 
deliver to Purchaser such documents as Purchaser shall  reasonably request
relating to the contribution of the  Subsidiaries referenced in clause (iii)
of this     -41-    paragraph (b), and such instruments of transfer of
all of the  membership interests in New LLC as Purchaser shall reasonably 
request.   (c) Prior to the Initial Transaction Time, Parent may  designate
one or more Contracts related to Indebtedness for borrowed  money extended by
publishers who supply the Company as "Vendor Excluded  Indebtedness." The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to  have the Vendor Excluded
Indebtedness amended to delete any provisions  contained therein that would,
if not so amended or deleted, cause a  default under Parent\'s senior credit
facility upon the occurrence of  the Effective Time. Parent shall cooperate
with the Company in seeking  such amendments or deletions. If,
notwithstanding the Company\'s  reasonable best efforts, the provisions are
not so amended or deleted  as of the Initial Transaction Time, such Contracts
shall no longer be  deemed to be Vendor Excluded Indebtedness, and shall be
repaid as  provided in Section 7.6(b)(i).   (d) At the Initial Transaction
Time, Parent shall extend a  loan to the Company in an amount equal to (i)
the amount necessary to  make the payments required by Section 7.6(b)(i) and
(ii), plus (ii) $10  million, minus (iii) the Company\'s estimate of the cash
on hand at the  Closing Date provided pursuant to paragraph (a) above. In
exchange  therefor, the Company shall execute and deliver to Parent a
promissory  note in the form of Exhibit B hereto.   (e) The transactions
described in Section 7.6(b)(iii) and (iv)  are referred to collectively
herein as the "Foreign Subsidiary Sale."  To the extent requested by Parent,
the parties to this Agreement shall  either (i) abandon and not undertake the
Foreign Subsidiary Sale, or  (ii) restructure the Foreign Subsidiary Sale in
a manner not materially  adverse to the Shareholders and which will not
reduce the Per Share  Amount or delay the consummation of the Merger.   (f)
The transactions described in this Section 7.6 are  referred to collectively
herein as the "Initial Transactions".   SECTION 7.7. EMPLOYEE MATTERS.  
(a) Any Employee whose employment is terminated by the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries without cause during the period beginning on  the Closing Date
and ending three months thereafter, shall be entitled  to severance benefits
on a basis no less favorable than those described  on Schedule 6.1(e); and
shall be entitled to participate on a fair and  equitable basis in the job
opportunity and employment placement  programs offered by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries (including the  Surviving Corporation, as applicable) for
which they are eligible.   (b) For a period beginning on the Closing Date
through  December 31, 2002, Parent shall cause each Salaried Employee whose 
employment is not terminated in accordance with subsection (a) above,  to be
provided with benefits no less favorable, taken as a whole, than  those
provided from time to time to employees of Parent\'s Subsidiaries  engaged in
the telecommunications business ("Telecom Employees"),     -42-   
provided that any employee benefit plan may be amended prior to  December 31,
2002, in accordance with its terms in such a way that does  not cause the
benefits extended to the Employees to be less favorable,  taken as a whole,
than those provided to Telecom Employees. With  respect to any Foreign Plans,
the principles set forth above shall  apply to the extent the application of
such principles does not violate  applicable Legal Requirements. This
paragraph (b) shall not apply with  respect to Employees who are paid by the
hour.   (c) Parent shall cause each Employee to be given full credit  for
all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the  Closing Date
for all purposes under any employee benefit plan, practice  or arrangement in
which the Employee participates on or after the  Closing Date (except to the
extent necessary to avoid the duplication  of benefits or for the purpose of
benefit accrual under any defined  benefit pension plan).   (d) For
purposes of determining the terms and conditions of an  Employee\'s
participation on and after the Closing Date in any employee  benefit plan,
practice or arrangement that is an employee welfare  benefit plan, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i)  waive all limitations as to
pre-existing condition exclusions and  waiting periods with respect to the
Employee or his or her dependents  under such plans, other than to the extent
limitations or waiting  periods that are already in effect with respect to
the Employee or his  or her dependents have not been satisfied as of the
Closing Date, and  (ii) provide each Employee with full credit for any
copayments and  deductibles paid in any plan year under a predecessor plan
in  satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any 
successor plan (on a pro-rata basis in the event of a difference in  plan
years).   (e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate 
its long-term incentive program (the "LTIP") effective as of April 30,  2002,
subject to the consummation of the Merger, provided that the  Company will be
permitted to make payments for the award cycle ending  April 30, 2003, on a
pro-rated basis equal to amounts previously  accrued for performance achieved
under the LTIP through April 30, 2002,  and the Company may pay such awards
as soon as practicable after April  30, 2002.   (f) All management
continuity agreements between the Company  and Employees in effect
immediately before the Closing Date set forth  on Schedule 4.15, shall be
honored after the Closing Date, in  accordance with their terms, until such
time as amended or terminated,  in accordance with their terms.   (g)
Nothing contained in this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to  create any legally
enforceable rights in favor of any Person not a  party to this
Agreement.     -43-    ARTICLE VIII.   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

recommendation, in whole or in part, because such action  would or might give
rise to a right on the part of Parent to  terminate this Agreement and/or

Recommendation.   (f) by Parent if: (i) any of the representations and

breach is not cured by the earlier of (x) the day prior to the  Special
Meeting, and (y) five (5) Business Days following written  notice to the
Company and (B) in the case of clause (iii), only with  respect to breaches

Agreement shall not be true and correct in  all material respects, or (iii)
Parent or Purchaser shall have failed  to perform any material obligation or
to comply with any material  agreement or material covenant to be performed
or complied with by it  under this Agreement (without giving effect to any

covenants), and in any case which breach is not cured following written 
notice to Parent by the earlier of (x) the day prior to the Special  Meeting,
and (y) within five (5) Business Days following written notice  to Parent,
except for such breaches which, individually or in the  aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse  effect on the ability of
Parent and Purchaser to consummate the  Transactions.   SECTION 9.2. EFFECT

Parent or the Company, as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and of no further force and effect; provided, however,

not for breach of any representation or warranty), provided that if
the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to Section 9.3(c)(ii)(A)(y) or 9.3(c)(ii)(B), including any
subsequent payment due pursuant to Section 9.3(d), such amounts shall be
deemed satisfaction in full for any and all damages incurred by Parent or
Purchaser in connection with any breaches of the Company giving rise to such
termination, and (b) Sections 9.2, 9.3, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 10.8, 10.10 and

finders fees and the expenses of  its representatives). Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, Parent  shall pay one-half and the Company shall pay one-
half of the HSR Act  filing fee.   (b) If any of the conditions set forth

Fee") plus  (ii) all of Parent\'s reasonable documented out-of-pocket
expenses  incurred in connection with the Transactions and the Transaction 
Documents, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $1,000,000 (the "Expense 
Reimbursement").   (c) The Company shall be obligated to pay the Termination
Fee  (or the portion thereof described below) and the Expense Reimbursement 
as follows:     -47-    (i) if Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to  the provisions of Section 9.1(e)(ii)(A) or (B)(x), or if

WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and the Company are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger
Agreement"), which provides for, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company (the
"Merger");   WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Shareholder
owns (beneficially and of record) or has dispositive and voting control with
respect to the number of shares of the Company\'s common stock, par value
$.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock"), set forth opposite such
Shareholder\'s name on Schedule I hereto (all such shares so owned or from
time to time controlled and which may hereafter be acquired or from time to
time controlled by such Shareholder prior to the termination of this
Agreement, whether upon the exercise of options or by means of purchase,

Shareholder\'s "Shares");   WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to
enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have required that the
Shareholders enter into this Agreement; and   WHEREAS, in order to induce
Parent and Purchaser to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Shareholders are
willing to enter into this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.   TRANSFER
AND VOTING OF SHARES; AND  OTHER COVENANTS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS   SECTION
1.1. VOTING OF SHARES. From the date hereof until the occurrence of a
Termination Event (as defined in Section 4.2) (the "Term"), at any meeting of
the shareholders of the Company, however called, and in any action by consent
of the shareholders of the Company,      each Shareholder shall vote (or
cause to be voted) its Shares (a) in favor of approval of the Merger and the
Merger Agreement (as amended from time to time), (b) against (i) any Takeover
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) any proposal for action
or agreement that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or
warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger
Agreement or which is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions to
the Parent\'s and Purchaser\'s obligations under the Merger Agreement not
being fulfilled, (iii) any change in the directors of the Company, (iv) any
change in the present capitalization of the Company, (v) any amendment to the
Company\'s Second Restated Articles of Incorporation or the Second Amended
and Restated By-Laws, (vi) any other material change in the Company\'s
corporate structure or business, or (vii) any other action which
could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or
materially adversely affect the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the likelihood of such transactions being consummated and (c) in
favor of any other matter necessary for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement which is considered at any such meeting
of shareholders or in such consent, and in connection therewith to execute
any documents which are necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the
foregoing, including the ability of Purchaser or its nominees to vote such
Shares directly.   SECTION 1.2. NO INCONSISTENT ARRANGEMENTS. Except
as contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, and, with respect
to PCM, except to the extent PCM\'s dispositive and voting power over its
Shares is revoked after the date hereof by the ultimate beneficial owner of
such Shares, each Shareholder shall not during the Term (a) transfer (which
term shall include, without limitation, any sale, assignment, gift, pledge,
hypothecation or other disposition), or consent to any transfer of, any or
all of such Shareholder\'s Shares or any interest therein, or create or
permit to exist any Encumbrance (as defined below) on such Shares, (b) enter
into any contract, option or other agreement or understanding with respect to
any transfer of any or all of such shares or any interest therein, (c) grant
any proxy, power-of-attorney or other authorization in or with respect to
such Shares, (d) deposit such Shares into a voting trust or enter into a
voting agreement or arrangement with respect to such Shares, or (e) take any
other action that would in any way restrict, limit or interfere with the
performance of its obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case
of an individual Shareholder, such Shareholder may transfer any or all of its
Shares to a charitable trust or foundation; provided, however, that in any
such case, prior to and as a condition to the effectiveness of such transfer,
each Person to which any of such Shares or any interest in any of such Shares
is or may be transferred shall have executed and delivered to Parent and
Purchaser a counterpart to this Agreement pursuant to which such Person shall
be bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.   SECTION
1.3. PROXY. Each Shareholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies or
powers of attorney in respect of any of such Shareholder\'s Shares and
constitutes and appoints Purchaser and Parent, or any nominee of Purchaser
and Parent, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, at any time
during the Term, as its true and lawful attorney and proxy (its "Proxy"), for
and in its name, place and stead, to demand that the Secretary of the Company
call a special meeting of the shareholders of the Company for the purpose of
considering any matter referred to in Section 1.1 and to vote each of such
Shares as its Proxy, as provided in Section 1.1, at every annual,
special, adjourned or postponed meeting of the shareholders of the Company,
including the right to sign its name (as shareholder) to any consent,
certificate or other document     -2-   relating to the Company that
Texas law may permit. Each Shareholder represents and warrants that (a) it
has not granted power of attorney to any other Person with respect to the
Shares and (b) any proxies heretofore given in respect of the Shares are not
irrevocable, and that any such proxies have been revoked.   THE FOREGOING
PROXY AND POWER OF ATTORNEY ARE IRREVOCABLE AND COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST
THROUGHOUT THE TERM, PROVIDED THAT PCM MAY REVOKE SUCH PROXY AND POWER SOLELY
TO THE EXTENT THAT ONE OR MORE ULTIMATE BENEFICIAL HOLDERS OF PCM\'S SHARES
REVOKES PCM\'S AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SHARES.   SECTION 1.4.
DISCLOSURE. Each Shareholder hereby authorizes Parent, Purchaser and the
Company to publish and disclose in any Form 8-K, Schedule 13D and the Proxy
Statement (including all documents and schedules filed with the Commission),
its identity and ownership of the Company Common Stock and the nature of its
commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement. Parent and
Purchaser shall permit each Shareholder to disclose the terms of this
Agreement in such Shareholder\'s Schedule 13D with respect to the Shares.  
SECTION 1.5. WAIVER OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. Each Shareholder hereby waives with
respect to its Shares any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the
Merger.   SECTION 1.6. SPOUSAL CONSENT. If a Shareholder is or may
be subject to the community property laws of any state or other jurisdiction,
such Shareholder shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause his/her
spouse to execute an acknowledgment and consent consenting to and agreeing to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such consent shall survive
until the occurrence of a Termination Event.   SECTION 1.7. STOP TRANSFER.
Prior to a Termination Event, each Shareholder shall not request that the
Company register, and the Company shall not register, the transfer (book-
entry or otherwise) of any certificate or uncertificated interest
representing any of such Shareholder\'s Shares, unless such transfer is made
in compliance with this Agreement.   SECTION 1.8. NO SOLICITATION.   (a)
During the Term, each Shareholder shall not, and it shall  cause its
subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, counsel,  investment bankers,
financial advisers, accountants, other  representatives and agents
(collectively, the "Representatives") not  to, (i) solicit, initiate, or
encourage, directly or indirectly  (including by way of furnishing
information), or take any other action  to facilitate, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal which  constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Takeover  Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding  any Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any
agreement with respect to  any Takeover Proposal. Upon execution of this
Agreement, each  Shareholder shall, and it shall cause its Representatives
to,  immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or negotiations 
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any of the 
foregoing.     -3-    (b) Each Shareholder shall promptly advise Parent
orally and  in writing of any request for information, proposal,
discussion,  negotiation or inquiry received by such Shareholder after the
date of  this Agreement, and each Shareholder shall promptly (but in any
event  within one Business Day) communicate to Parent the material terms
and  conditions of any such proposal, discussion, negotiation or inquiry 
which it may receive (and will promptly provide to Parent copies of any 
written materials received by it in connection with such proposal, 
discussion, negotiation or inquiry) and the identity of the Person  making
such proposal or inquiry or engaging in such discussion or  negotiation.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 1.8 to the  contrary, if any
Shareholder or any of its Representatives is a member  of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors"),  such member of the
Board of Directors may take actions in such  capacity.   ARTICLE II.

represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:   SECTION 2.1.

hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such
Shareholder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on

other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors and to general principles of equity and except that the
availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance,
is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding for
such remedy may be brought. There is no beneficiary or holder of a voting
trust certificate or other interest of any trust of which such Shareholder is
trustee whose consent is required for the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation by such Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 2.2. NO CONFLICTS; REQUIRED FILINGS AND
CONSENTS.   (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such 
Shareholder does not, and the performance of this Agreement by such 
Shareholder will not, (i) contravene, conflict with or violate any law 
applicable to such Shareholder or by which such Shareholder or any of  such
Shareholder\'s properties is bound or affected or (ii) result in  any breach
of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or  lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or give to others  any rights of
termination, acceleration or cancellation of, or result  in the creation of a
lien or encumbrance on any assets of such  Shareholder, including, without
limitation, such Shareholder\'s Shares,  pursuant to, any     -4-   
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, 
permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which such 
Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder or any of such 
Shareholder\'s assets is bound or affected, except for any such  breaches,
defaults or other occurrences that would not prevent or delay  the
performance by such Shareholder of such Shareholder\'s obligations  under
this Agreement.   (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such 
Shareholder does not, and the performance of this Agreement by such 
Shareholder will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or  permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any governmental or  regulatory
authority, domestic or foreign, except where the failure to  obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make  such filings or
notifications, would not prevent or delay the  performance by such
Shareholder of such Shareholder\'s obligations under  this Agreement.  
SECTION 2.3. TITLE TO SHARES. JO is the sole record and beneficial owner of
her Shares, free and clear of any pledge, lien, security interest, mortgage,

IV.   MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION 4.1. DEFINITIONS. Terms used but not
otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Merger Agreement.   SECTION 4.2. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall
terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the first to occur of
(i) the completion of a valid vote of the Shareholders on the Merger and the
Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; (ii) the termination of the    
-6-   Merger Agreement by any party thereto in accordance with its terms;
or (iii) the amendment of the Merger Agreement without the written consent of
the Shareholders that (x) provides for a reduction in the Per Share Amount
below $37.00 or (y) changes the form of the payment of the Per Share Amount
to other than cash (each a "Termination Event"). No such termination of this
Agreement shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach of
this Agreement prior to termination.   SECTION 4.3. FURTHER ASSURANCE. From
time to time, at another party\'s request and without consideration, each
party hereto shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all
such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 4.4. CERTAIN EVENTS.
JO agrees that this Agreement and JO\'s obligations hereunder shall attach to
her Shares and shall be binding upon any person or entity to which legal or
beneficial ownership of such Shares shall pass, whether by operation of law
or otherwise, including, without limitation, JO\'s heirs, guardians,
administrators, or successors. Notwithstanding any transfer of Shares, the
transferor shall remain liable for the performance of all its obligations
under this Agreement.   SECTION 4.5. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each
Shareholder acknowledges that if such Shareholder fails to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement immediate and irreparable harm or injury
would be caused to Parent and Purchaser for which money damages would not be
an adequate remedy. In such event, each Shareholder agrees that each of
Parent and Purchaser shall have the right, in addition to any other rights it
may have, to specific performance of this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent
or Purchaser should institute an action or proceeding seeking specific
enforcement of the provisions hereof, each Shareholder hereby waives the
claim or defense that Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, has an
adequate remedy at law and hereby agrees not to assert in any such action or
proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists. Each
Shareholder further agrees to waive any requirements for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with obtaining any such
equitable relief.   SECTION 4.6. NOTICE. All notices and other
communications given or made pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given or made (i) as of the date delivered or sent

reflect an  arms-length transaction and are customary for the nature of the 
services rendered.  SUB-SECTION (d)   o Since January 31, 2002, the
Company has spent approximately $1.1  million in aggregate capital
expenditures. The following two single  capital expenditures exceed $150,000:

and casualty insurance  policy for shrink-wrap software lost in 1997/1998 due
to fraudulent  orders by a third party. The gross amount of the software lost

Spectrum, Inc. and paid Software Spectrum, Inc.  $100,000.00.   o The

extent to which an executive officer remains employed by the Company or its
successor after consummation of the Merger and the circumstances under which

29    SCHEDULE 4.16   LITIGATION   The following actions are pending;
however, the Company does not believe that an adverse judgement would
individually or in the aggregate be material to the Company:   MARILEA D.
MCCOWAN V. SOFTWARE SPECTRUM, INC. AND PATRICIA GRECCO   Former mail room
employee, employed for five months from December 1997 to May 1998 before
resigning from the Company, filed a lawsuit in District Court in Dallas
County alleging sexual harassment, sex discrimination, retaliation, negligent
retention, training and supervision, assault and battery
and wrongful/constructive discharge. Ms. McCowan seeks unspecific monetary
damages. Software Spectrum denies her claims. Software Spectrum\'s amended
motion for summary judgment was granted by the trial court. Ms. McCowan
appealed the trial court\'s decision, and the El Paso Court of Appeals
rendered a reversal of the decision of the trial court with respect to Ms.
McCowan\'s claims of sexual harassment, sex discrimination, retaliation,
assault and battery and wrongful/constructive discharge. The Appeals Court
affirmed the trial court\'s decision on negligent retention, training and
supervision. No insurance carriers have been notified with respect to this
claim, as the claim does not fall within coverage provided by the Company\'s
existing insurance policies.   ANDREW PHILLIPS V. SOFTWARE SPECTRUM PTY
LIMITED   The former Managing Director of Software Spectrum\'s APAC
operations, who was employed by Software Spectrum for approximately two and
one half months, was separated from Software Spectrum in December 2000. Upon
separation, Mr. Phillips was paid all sums due to him under his employment
agreement. Mr. Phillips subsequently filed an action with the Industrial
Relations Commission of New South Wales, Australia seeking a determination by
the Commission that the employment agreement between Software Spectrum and
Mr. Phillips is unfair, harsh and unconscionable and against the public
interest. Software Spectrum denies his claims. Mr. Phillips seeks monetary
damages in the approximate amount of A$1,400,000 plus a grant of 5,000 stock
options to replace options that expired upon his separation from the Company.
At mediation, Mr. Phillips\'s last offer of settlement was A$860,000. The
action should proceed to a hearing before the Industrial Relations Commission
in Summer/Fall 2002. No insurance carriers have been notified with respect to
this claim, as the claim does not fall within coverage provided by the
Company\'s existing insurance policies.   JOHN SPRAGUE   John Sprague, the
former President of Contact Services, has made a claim in connection with his
separation from the Company, which was effective April 12, 2002. Mr. Sprague
asserts that he is owed payments under his Management Continuity Agreement as
a result of the Company\'s hiring Omni International LLC, an investment bank
hired to identify and evaluate potential Contact Services acquisitions on
behalf of the Company. The Company disagrees with Mr. Sprague\'s claim and
his interpretation of the Management Continuity Agreement. Mr. Sprague\'s
claim falls under his Arbitration Agreement with the Company.

state and local income tax liability is expected to be
approximately $65,000.   2. The Company recently identified five states in
which the activity of its sales force could create income tax nexus. The
resulting potential income tax liability in these five states is expected to

collected Canadian sales taxes with respect to certain Canadian transactions.
