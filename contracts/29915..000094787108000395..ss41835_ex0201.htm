WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of

contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree as follows:

ARTICLE II 

 

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

 

Section 2.1 Effect on Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders
of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

 

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.1(d) and Section
2.1(e), each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $2.50
per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares collectively, "Company Common Stock" or "Shares" and each,
a "Share"), other than any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the extent
provided in, Section 2.1(b)) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined, and to
the extent provided in, Section 2.1(e)), shall thereupon be converted into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the sum of $78.00 in cash
and the Additional Per Share Consideration, (together, rounded to the nearest
penny, the "Merger Consideration"). The "Additional Per Share Consideration"
shall not be less than zero and shall mean, (x) if the Effective Time shall
occur after January 10, 2009 (the "Additional Consideration Date"), an amount
in cash per share, equal to the excess, if any, of (I) $78.00 multiplied by
the product of (A) 8% and (B) the Annualized Portion (as defined below), over
(II) any dividends or distributions (valued at the Closing Date using 8%
simple interest per annum from the applicable date of payment) declared on a
share of Company Common Stock and having a record date

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during the Dividend Period and thereafter paid (it being understood that in
no event shall the Additional Per Share Consideration be paid in respect of
any period from and after July 10, 2009), or (y) if the Effective Time shall
occur on or prior to the Additional Consideration Date, zero; provided that
no adjustment shall be made for more than two quarterly dividends. The term
"Annualized Portion" shall mean the quotient obtained by dividing the number
of days elapsed during the Dividend Period by 365. The term "Dividend
Period" means the period beginning on the Additional Consideration Date and
ending on the earlier of July 10, 2009 and the Closing Date. All Shares
that have been thus converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist and the holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares
("Certificates") or holders of Shares represented by book entry ("Book-Entry
Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other
than the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in
accordance with this Article II.

 

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares. Each Share that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
or held by the Company as treasury stock (in each case, other than any such
Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the "Cancelled Shares") shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common
stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 

(d) Adjustments. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 

 

(e) Dissenting Shares. (i) Notwithstanding anything contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, no Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the holder of which (A) has not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, (B) has demanded its rights to
appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, and (C) has not
effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a). By virtue of the Merger, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those rights provided
under the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights
or other rights of a member or equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or
of a stockholder of Parent.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.1(e), if any holder of
Shares who demands dissenters' rights shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its rights
of appraisal, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence
of such event, such holder's Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 

 

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands
for dissenters' rights of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
which relate to any such demand for dissenters' rights and (B) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for dissenters' rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for dissenters' rights or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.

 

 

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed to act as a paying agent hereunder and approved in advance by
the Company in writing (the "Paying Agent"), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, the Company Stock Options (as defined in Section
5.5(a)(i)) and the Company Stock-Based Awards (as defined in Section
5.5(a)(ii)), cash sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in
exchange for all of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable
upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II and (ii) the Option and Stock-Based Consideration (as defined
in Section 5.5(a)(ii)) payable pursuant to Section 5.5 (such cash referred to
in sub-section 2.2(a)(i) and 2.2(a)(ii) being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund").

 

 

(b) Payment Procedures. (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day
following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1, (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably specify), and (y) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. On the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall also deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Company Stock Option or a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company Stock-Based Award by wire transfer the amount due and payable to such
holder pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option
or Company Stock-Based Award.

 

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with, in the case
of Certificates, such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agent's message," and
such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares represented by such holder's properly surrendered
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be paid to
such a transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes (as defined in Section 3.14(b)) have been
paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article II.

 

 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Shares
or holder of Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards, such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.3(b)), such withheld or deducted
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares or holder of the Company Stock Options or
Company Stock-Based Awards, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made.

 

 

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this Article II.

 

 

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards
for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

former holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
due surrender of their Shares.

 

 

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other person (as defined in Section 8.13(a)) shall be liable to
any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have
been surrendered prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration payable
to the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to this
Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any former holder
of Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim
for Merger Consideration.

 

 

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

 

 

(g) Lost Certificates. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

 

 

ARTICLE III 

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section
3.4(a)) filed or furnished with the SEC subsequent to December 31, 2006 and
prior to the date hereof (and then (i) only to the extent reasonably apparent
in the Company SEC Documents that such disclosed item is an event, item or
occurrence relates to a matter covered by a representation or warranty set
forth in this Article III and (ii) other than in risk factors or other
forward-looking statements or language in such filings) or in the Disclosure
Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 

Section 3.1 Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 8.13(a)) is a legal
entity duly organized,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business
and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, has not had and would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement
a true and complete copy of the Company's restated certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, each as amended through the date hereof. Such
restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and the equivalent
organizational documents of each material Subsidiary are in full force and
effect and neither the Company nor any material Subsidiary is in violation of
any provision of the Company's restated certificate of incorporation and by-
laws or equivalent organizational documents. As used in this Agreement, any
reference to any state of facts, circumstances, event or change having a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means such state of facts, circumstances,
event or change that has had a material adverse effect on the business,
operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, but shall not include (a) facts, circumstances, events or changes
(i) generally affecting the specialty chemical industry or the segments
thereof in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate (including changes
to commodity prices) in the United States or elsewhere, (ii) generally
affecting the economy or the financial, debt, credit or securities markets,
in the United States or elsewhere, (iii) resulting from any political
conditions or developments in general, (iv) resulting from any outbreak or
escalation of hostilities, declared or undeclared acts of war or terrorism
(other than any of the foregoing to the extent that it causes any direct
damage or destruction to or renders physically unusable or inaccessible any
facility or property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (v)
reflecting or resulting from changes or proposed changes in Law (including
rules and regulations) or interpretation thereof or GAAP (as defined in
Section 3.4(b)) (or interpretations thereof), or (vi) resulting from actions
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which Parent has expressly
requested in writing or to which Parent has expressly consented in writing;
or (b) any decline in the stock price of the Company Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange or any failure to meet internal or published projections,
forecasts or revenue or earning predictions for any period (provided that
the underlying causes of such decline or failure may, to the extent
applicable, be considered in determining whether there is a Company Material
Adverse Effect), or (c) any facts, circumstances, events or changes resulting
from the announcement or the existence of, or compliance (other than the
obligation of the Company to comply with its obligations to operate in the
ordinary course of business) with, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that this clause (c) shall not
diminish the effect of, and shall be disregarded for purposes of, the
representations and warranties relating to required consents, approvals,
change in control provisions or similar rights of acceleration, termination,
modification or waiver based upon the entering into of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger. For purposes of clarification, any actions
required by any person to comply with Section 5.6 (and the impact thereof)
shall be excluded from the determination of Company Material Adverse Effect.

(a) The Company has requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
(as defined in Section 3.18), to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company and, except
for (i) the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize

Directors of the Company has taken all necessary action so that none of the
restrictions set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL (the "Interested
Stockholder Statute") apply to the Merger, this Agreement, the Support
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Board
of Directors of the Company has determined that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are fair to and in the best interest of the Company and
its stockholders and to recommend to such stockholders that they approve and
adopt this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of the Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms.

 

 

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the provisions of
the DGCL, (ii) the Exchange Act, (iii) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act"), (iv) any applicable requirements
under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control

the European Union on January 29, 2004 at L 24/1) (the "EC
Merger Regulation"), (v) any applicable requirements of Laws in other
foreign jurisdictions governing antitrust or merger control matters, and (vi)
the approvals set forth on Section 3.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Company Approvals"), no authorization, consent or
approval of, or filing with, any United States or foreign governmental or
regulatory agency, national securities exchange, commission, court, body,
entity or authority (each, a "Governmental Entity") is necessary, under
applicable Law, for the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for such authorizations, consents,
approvals or filings (x) that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or (y) as may arise in connection with the Financing or as a
result of facts, circumstances relating to Parent or its affiliates (as
defined in Section 8.13(a)) or Laws or contracts binding on Parent or its
affiliates.

 

 

(c) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with
the provisions hereof will not (i) result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement,
contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding
upon the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or result in the
creation of any liens, claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges,

of the properties or assets of the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision
of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other equivalent
organizational document, in each case as amended, of the Company or any of
the Company's Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or violate any Laws
applicable to the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets, other than, (x) in the case of clauses
(i), clause (ii) (other than in the case of immaterial Subsidiaries) and
(iii), any such violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, loss or Lien that has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect and (y) as may arise in connection with the Financing or as a
result of facts, circumstances relating to Parent or its affiliates or Laws
or contracts binding on Parent or its affiliates.

 

 

Section 3.4 Reports and Financial Statements.

 

 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports
required to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since December 31, 2005 (the
"Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as
of the date of the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied
in all material respects, and all documents required to be filed or furnished
by the Company with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time (the "Subsequent Company SEC Documents") will comply in all material
respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained, and none of the
Subsequent Company SEC Documents will contain, any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted, or will omit, to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made, not
misleading. No Subsidiary is required to file any form, report or other
document with the SEC.

 

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly
present in all material respects, and when included in the Subsequent Company
SEC Documents will fairly present in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at
the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations
and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended
(subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein including the
notes thereto) in conformity with applicable generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto). Since December 31, 2007, the Company has not made any change in the
accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of its financial
statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law.

 

 

Section 3.5 Internal Controls and Procedures.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively of Rules 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act").

 

 

(b) The Company maintains a standard system of accounting established and
administered in accordance with GAAP in all material respects. The Company
and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed
in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

 

 

Section 3.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (i) as disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in the Company's consolidated balance sheets (or the
notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished on or
prior to the date hereof, (ii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business since December 31, 2007, and (iii) liabilities which have
been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, as of the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any
liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto), other
than those which have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. For the
avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 3.6, the terms "liabilities"
shall not include obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
perform under or comply with any Law, action, judgment or contract (in each
case, other than an obligation to pay money) but would include such
obligations if there has been a default or failure to perform or comply by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any such obligation if such
default or failure would, with the giving of notice or passage of time or
both, reasonably be expected to result in a monetary obligation.

 

 

Section 3.7 Compliance with Law; Permits.

 

 

(a) The Company and each of the Company's Subsidiaries are in compliance with
and are not in default under or in violation of any federal, state, local or
foreign Law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree, agency requirement, license or permit of any Governmental
Entity (collectively, "Laws" and each, a "Law"), applicable to the Company,
such Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except
where such non-compliance, default or violation has not had and would not
reasonably be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 3.7(a)
no representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this Section
3.7(a) in respect of the matters referenced in Section 3.5, or in respect
of environmental, Tax, employee benefits or labor Laws matters.

 

 

(b) The Company and the Company's Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Entity necessary for the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as
they are now being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the
failure to have any of the Company Permits has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse. All Company Permits are in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) the Company and its

formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Response actions for its current use, (ii) that is in violation of
Environmental Law, or (iii) that is reasonably likely to give rise to any
Environmental Liability, (e) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary

the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice, demand
letter, claim or request for information alleging that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is or may be in violation of or subject to liability under
any Environmental Law, including with respect to any Hazardous Substance sent
offsite by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary, or from any real
property currently owned, leased or operated by the Company or any
Subsidiary, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no such notice, demand
letter, claim or request is threatened; (g) neither the Company nor any of

Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished to the SEC

properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the Financing (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect").

 

 

Section 4.2 Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation.

 

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Financing. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing, have been duly and validly
authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and, except
for the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
Delaware, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Financing. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreements of the Company, this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreements of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with their terms.

Governmental Entity is necessary for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing,
except for such authorizations, consents, approvals or filings, that, if not
obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Financing, and compliance with the provisions hereof will not
(i) result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material benefit

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond,

Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties
or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result
in any violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws or other equivalent organizational document, in each case as amended, of
Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such violation,

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

and the Exchange Act, or other applicable Laws, as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Parent SEC Documents contained, and none of the Subsequent Parent SEC

or will omit, to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, or are to be made, not misleading.

 

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present in
all material respects, and when included in the Subsequent Parent SEC
Documents will fairly present in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject,
in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments
and to any other adjustments described therein including the notes thereto)
in conformity with or on a basis reconciled to GAAP (except, in the case of
the unaudited statements, as permitted by the applicable rules and forms
promulgated by the SEC or the comparable regulatory body of its home
jurisdiction) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto). Since December

supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

all of the funds required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and for the satisfaction of all of
Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement, including the

to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

and its Subsidiaries' respective businesses and properties as Parent or its
Representatives may from time to time reasonably request, except that nothing

information to Parent that would cause a violation of any agreement to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a loss of
privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or would constitute a
violation of applicable Laws. Parent hereby agrees that it shall treat any
such information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of June, 30, 2008, between the Company and Parent (the

expected to constitute, a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) enter into,
maintain, participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic information with respect

any Company Alternative Proposal, (iv) authorize or permit any of its or its

5.3(b)). Subject to Section 5.3(b), the Company shall not release any third
party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it is a party. The Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and the Subsidiaries' Representatives
to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any parties that may have been conducted heretofore with
respect to a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) with respect to third parties
with whom discussions or negotiations have been terminated on or prior to the

any physical or virtual data room to no longer be accessible to or by any
person other than Parent and its Affiliates.

 

 

(b) The Company will promptly notify Parent orally (and then in writing
within twenty-four (24) hours) after it or any of its Subsidiaries has
received any proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting
a Company Alternative Proposal, any request for discussions or negotiations,
or any request for information relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries
in connection with a Company Alternative Proposal or a potential
Company Alternative Proposal or for access to the properties or books and
records thereof of which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives is or become aware, or any amendments to
the foregoing. Such notice to Parent shall indicate the identity of
the person making such proposal and the terms and conditions of such
proposal, if any. The Company shall also promptly provide Parent with (i)
a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any
person informing the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives that it is considering making, or has made a
proposal regarding, a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) a copy of any
Company Alternative Proposal (or any amendment thereof) received by the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and (iii) such other details of any such
Company Alternative Proposal that Parent may reasonably request. Thereafter,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of any change to the terms
of any such Company Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the limitations
set forth in Section 5.3(a) and subject to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance with this Section 5.3(b), if the Company receives a Company

(i) which constitutes a Company Superior Proposal (as defined in Section
5.3(g)) or (ii) which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, could reasonably be expected to result, after the taking
of any of the actions referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) below, in a
Company Superior Proposal, the Company may take any or all of the following
actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party (and any
persons working in concert with such third party and to their respective
potential financing sources and Representatives) making any such Company
Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing
such information, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement and any related agreements shall not include any
provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party or
having the effect of prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations
under this Agreement and shall contain a standstill provision substantially
similar to the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement to the
extent such provisions remain in effect (it being agreed that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any particular standstill
provision to the extent the Company irrevocably and simultaneously releases
Parent from such corresponding standstill provision)), (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the third party (and such other persons)
with respect to the Company Alternative Proposal and (z) release any third
party from, or waive any provision of, a confidentiality or
standstill provision to which it is a party if, in the case of this clause
(z), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action is necessary under
applicable Law in order for the directors to comply with their fiduciary
duties to the Company's stockholders.

 

 

(c) In response to the receipt of a Company Alternative Proposal (that did
not arise or result from a breach of this Section 5.3) that has not been
withdrawn, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Board of Directors of the Company may change, withhold or withdraw the
Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.4(c)) (a "Company Change
of Recommendation") but only if the Board of Directors of the Company
has concluded in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) such Company
Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (y)
effecting a Company Change of Recommendation is required for the Board of
Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Company and its stockholders under applicable Law. No Company Change of
Recommendation shall change the approval of the Board of Directors of the
Company for purposes of causing any state takeover Law (including the
Interested Stockholder Statute) or other state Law or the Rights Plan to be
inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of
Directors of the Company, in circumstances not involving or relating to a
Company Alternative Proposal, from amending, modifying or withdrawing the
Company Recommendation to the extent that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that such action is necessary under applicable Law in order for the
directors to comply with their fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company's Board of Directors, after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, such disclosure
is required in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary
obligations, or is otherwise required, under applicable Law.

 

 

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Company Alternative Proposal" shall mean any
unsolicited, bona fide, written proposal or any unsolicited bona fide,
written offer made by any person (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries) relating to: (i) any merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other business combination transaction, or a "merger of equals", in each case
involving the Company; (ii) the acquisition by any person or "group" of
persons, directly or indirectly, of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iii)
the acquisition by any person or "group" of persons of twenty percent (20%)
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company; or (iv) any tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or
group of "persons" beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company.

 

 

(g) As used in this Agreement "Company Superior Proposal", shall mean a
Company Alternative Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial
advisors and outside legal counsel and after taking into account relevant
financial, legal, regulatory, estimated timing of consummation and other
aspects of such proposal and the person or group making such proposal, is
more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the Merger
For purposes of the definition of "Company Superior Proposal", each
reference to 20% in the definition of "Company Alternative Proposal" shall be
replaced with "50%".

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) unless and until
(x) the Company has promptly (and in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) provided a written notice to Parent (a "Superior Proposal Notice")
advising Parent that the Company has received a Company Alternative Proposal
and specifying the information required by Section 5.3(b) and including
written notice of the determination of the Board of the Directors of the
Company that the Company Alternative Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal promptly upon the Board of Directors of the Company making such
determination, (y) the Company has provided Parent with an opportunity, for a
period of five (5) business days from the date of delivery to Parent of the
Superior Proposal Notice (the "Notice Period"), to amend (the "Right
to Match") the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Merger, including an increase in, or modification of, the Merger
Consideration (any such proposed transaction, a "Revised Transaction"), such
that the Company Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, and (z)(1) during such Notice Period, the Company and its
Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives
with respect to such Revised Transaction and (2) at the end of such Notice
Period, the Board of Directors of the Company, has determined that the
Company Superior Proposal continues to be a Company Superior
Proposal notwithstanding the Revised Transaction and taking into account all
amendments and proposed changes made thereto during the Notice Period.

Section 5.4 Filings, Other Actions.

 

 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement (including the preliminary Proxy
Statement) and any amendment or supplement to the preliminary Proxy Statement
and, except to the extent provided in Section 5.3 (c) or (d), the Proxy
Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company that the Company's stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement. As
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company
shall file with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement; provided that
subject to applicable Law the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to file the preliminary Proxy Statement within 30 days following the
date of this Agreement, and, thereafter, shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the preliminary Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC
as promptly as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that the Company
shall furnish such preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent and give Parent and
its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to review such preliminary
Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall consider in good faith
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in
connection therewith. The Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy
Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information and shall provide to Parent as promptly
as reasonably practicable, copies of all written correspondence (and
summaries of any oral comments) between the Company or any Representative of
the Company and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall provide Parent and its legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any proposed response to any comment of the SEC
staff and any amendment or supplement to each of the preliminary and the
definitive Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall consider in
good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent
in connection therewith. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the
Company with such information as may be required to be included in the Proxy
Statement or as may be reasonably required to respond to any comment of the
SEC staff. After all the comments received from the SEC have been cleared by
the SEC staff and all information required to be contained in the
Proxy Statement have been included therein by the Company, the Company shall
file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated (including by electronic delivery if permitted)
as promptly as reasonably practicable, to its stockholders of record, as of
the record date established by the Board of Directors of the Company. Each of
the parties shall correct promptly, any information provided by it to be
used specifically in the Proxy Statement, if required, that shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and shall take all steps
necessary to file with the SEC and have cleared by the SEC any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so as to correct the same and to cause the
Proxy Statement as so corrected to be disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

 

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in order to lift
any injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein.

 

 

(c) Subject to Section 7.1(g) of this Agreement, the Company shall take all
action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its restated certificate of
incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders as promptly

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and subject
to the last sentence of this Section 5.4(c), no later than thirty (30) days
after the dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company's stockholders)
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company
Meeting") and, subject to Section 5.3 (c) or (d), shall include in the Proxy
Statement the recommendations of its Board of Directors that its stockholders
approve and adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Company Recommendation"). Subject to Section 5.3
of this Agreement, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption and approval
of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger. Neither the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Company
Alternative Proposal (whether or not a Company Superior Proposal), nor any
furnishing of information, discussions or negotiations with respect thereto,
nor any decision or action by the Board of Directors of the Company to effect
a Company Change of Recommendation shall give the Company any right to delay,
defer or adjourn the Company Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to the extent reasonably
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to the Company's stockholders or to permit
dissemination of information which is material to stockholders voting at the
Company Meeting, or, if as of the time the Company Meeting is scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting or for the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger.

 

 

Section 5.5 Stock Options and Other Stock Based Awards; Employee Matters.

 

 

(a) Stock Options and Other Stock Based Awards.

 

 

(i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") granted under the employee and director stock plans of
the Company (the "Company Stock Plans"), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right at the
Effective Time to receive an amount in cash, equal to the product of (x) the
total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such
payment rounded to the nearest cent (the aggregate amount of such cash
hereinafter referred to as the "Option Consideration").

 

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in
part by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each
award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under
the Company Stock Plans or the Company Benefit Plans (including performance
shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred
stock units and dividend equivalents), other than Company Stock Options
(each, a "Company Stock-Based Award"), whether vested or unvested, which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent
a right or award

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, shall become fully vested and
shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount
in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share underlying
a particular vested Stock-Based Award (except that in the case of the long-
term performance share plan, such awards shall vest on a pro rata basis
reflecting the portion of the applicable performance period that has elapsed
through the date on which the Effective Time occurs assuming performance at
the greater of target or actual levels as described in more detail on Section
5.1(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) (the aggregate amount of such
cash, together with the Option Consideration, hereinafter referred to as the
"Option and Stock-Based Consideration"). For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 5.5(a)(ii) shall not apply to shares of Company Common Stock held in
the Company's leveraged ESOP which shall be covered by Article II as issued
and outstanding Shares.

 

 

(iii) The compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company
shall pass such resolutions with respect to the Company Stock Options and
Company Stock-Based Awards consistent with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 5.5.

 

 

(b) Employee Matters.

 

 

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit
Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of
two years following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
to be provided, to each current and former employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees") compensation and benefits that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits
provided to each such Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time.
For a period of two years following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who suffers a termination of employment under the
circumstances described on Section 5.5(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule severance benefits in accordance with Section 5.5(b)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (taking into account such Company Employee's
service as required pursuant to Section 5.5(b)(ii) below). Parent shall
continue to maintain the Company's retiree welfare programs for the benefit
of Company Employees without adverse amendment (other than as required by
Law) for a period of three years following the Effective Time and thereafter,
Parent shall provide Company Employees with retiree welfare benefits that are
no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. In addition, for a period of at
least five years following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each Company Employee who participates in a defined
benefit pension plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time pension
benefits (including pension benefit accrual rates) under such defined benefit
pension plan without adverse amendment to the pension benefits (including
pension benefit accrual rates) provided under such plan as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, but after giving effect to the amendment to
eliminate the cost-of-living adjustment on all future accruals.

 

 

(ii) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any pension plan sponsored
by Parent or its subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries))
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time (and to
the extent there is no a similar Company plan, service as recognized for
purposes of the Company's 401(k) Plan), provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage
under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the
Merger (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

 

(iii) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section
3.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

 

 

Section 5.6 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals,
including the Company Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of
all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, and in any event no
later than fifteen (15) business days after the date hereof, make all
required filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act,
(ii) as promptly as practicable make appropriate filings with the European
Commission in accordance with the EC Merger Regulation, (iii) use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any
filings are required to be made with, or actions or nonactions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,
consents or approvals are required to be obtained from, any other
Governmental Entities (including any foreign jurisdiction in which the
Company or its Subsidiaries are operating any business) or third parties in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely making
all such filings and timely seeking all such actions or nonactions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,
consents and approvals, (iv) supply as promptly as practicable such
information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to any Regulatory
Law (as defined in Section 5.6(f)) by any Governmental Entity, and (v) use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limiting the foregoing, but subject to Section 5.6(e), Parent shall take all
such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any,
as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice, the European Commission, state antitrust
enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction, or any other person, may assert under Regulatory Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate,
and minimize the impact of, each and every impediment under any Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger in each
case so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and
in any event no later than the initial End Date (as defined in Section
7.1(b)), including, without limitation (x) proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets, businesses, products or
product lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates), (y) creating or terminating relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates and (z) otherwise taking or committing
to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent
or its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving Corporation's) or affiliates'
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its or its Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving Corporation's) or
affiliates' businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to obtain all required actions or nonactions, waivers,
authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, clearances,
consents and approvals and to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other
order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the initial End Date
(each of (x), (y) and (z), a "Divestiture Action"). If requested by Parent,
the Company shall agree to any Divestiture Action, provided that any such
agreement or action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger.

 

 

(c) Parent shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other Person relating to
the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulatory Law, including any communications with any Governmental Entity
relating to any contemplated or proposed Divestiture Action. Without limiting
the foregoing and subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, each of the Company and Parent
agrees to (i) cooperate and consult with each other, (ii) furnish to the
other such necessary information and assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of any notifications or filings,
(iii) keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions, (iv)
permit the other party to review and incorporate the other party's reasonable
comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Entity
with respect to obtaining the necessary approvals for the Merger, and (v) in
the case of Parent, not to participate in any meeting or discussion expected
to address substantive matters related to the transactions contemplated
hereby, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, it gives the Company the opportunity
to attend and observe. Subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company agrees it shall consult
with Parent in advance of and not to participate in any meeting or discussion
expected to address substantive matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, it gives Parent the opportunity to
attend and observe. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to
share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this Section in a manner so as to preserve any
applicable privilege.

 

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement requires Parent or Merger Sub to
take, or cause to be taken, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be
required to take, or cause to be taken, any Divestiture Action with respect
to any of the assets, businesses or product lines of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any combination
thereof, if the overlapping assets, businesses or product lines required to
be divested in order to obtain a Company Approval under any Regulatory Law
represented in the aggregate in excess of $1.3 billion of revenue for the 12
months ending December 31, 2007 (excluding from such calculation any non-
merchant revenues and any revenue of any non-overlapping assets, businesses
or product lines which may be divested as part of the applicable Divestiture
Action); provided, however, that other than in the case of the Company's
assets, businesses and product lines of or marketed or otherwise conducted
through the entity identified on Schedule 5.6(e), Parent shall not be
required to divest any assets, businesses or product lines of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The parties agree that the calculation
of revenue shall (x) be measured by reference to the lowest such revenue
(excluding any non-merchant revenue) of Parent or the Company for each such
overlapping asset, business or product line so required to be divested to
obtain such Company Approval, regardless of which asset, business or product
line Parent actually divests and (y) in the case of the entity identified on
Schedule 5.6(e), only include the Company's portion of the revenue generated
from or through such entity.

 

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the EC Merger Regulation, and all other federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws, including
without limitation any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Laws, that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening competition through merger or acquisition.

 

 

Section 5.7 Takeover Statute. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 5.8 Public Announcements. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such
press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein, shall reasonably consider all
additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party in connection
therewith, and shall not issue any such press release or other public
statement or comment prior to such consultation except as may be required by
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint press
release announcing this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be (the
"Indemnified Parties"), of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For
a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect (A) the current provisions
regarding indemnification of officers and directors contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries with any
of their respective directors, officers and employees existing as on the
date hereof.

 

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each
Indemnified Party against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit
or proceeding, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action
or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before, at or after
the Effective Time in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of any entity if such service was at the request or for
the benefit of the Company or any such Subsidiary, including any actions
or omissions or alleged actions or omissions in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries
or provide substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in either case,
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions and
from carriers with comparable credit ratings which are no less advantageous
to the insureds with respect to claims arising from facts or events, actions
or omissions on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 250% of the annual
premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the year ending
December 31, 2007 (the "Maximum Amount"), and if the Surviving Corporation is
unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.9 it shall obtain
as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year
period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each
policy year within such period. The Company may in lieu of the foregoing
insurance coverage, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid
"tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or carriers with
comparable credit ratings, as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives. Parent
shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided in this Section 5.9.

 

 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this Section 5.9 shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Company or any of its

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsidiaries, any agreements between such persons and the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or any applicable Laws, or under any insurance policies.

 

 

(f) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into
any other persons, or (B) transfers 50% or more of its properties or assets
to any person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.9.

 

 

Section 5.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to approve in advance in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of
the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or who will
become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to equity securities of the
Company.

 

 

Section 5.11 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 

 

Section 5.12 Certain Transfer Taxes. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent and expressly shall not be a liability
of stockholders of the Company.

 

 

Section 5.13 Notification of Certain Matters. From the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby
or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with the Merger if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent purports to
materially affect the consummation of the Merger, or (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party's
knowledge, threatened against such party or any of its subsidiaries which
purports to materially affect the consummation of the Merger provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.13 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

manner set forth in clauses (i) or (ii), as applicable), only as of such date
or period; and provided further that the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in Section 3.2(a) and (b) (in each case to the extent

after any approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by
the stockholders of the Company:

 

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent if (i) the Effective Time shall not have

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the Company Meeting (after any

(e) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

Section 6.2 and (2) cannot be cured by the End Date, provided that

provided, that any such purported termination by the Company pursuant to this
Section 7.1(g) shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company
concurrently with such termination pays to Parent the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 7.2; and

 

 

(h) by Parent or Merger Sub, in the event of a Company Change of

which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. For purposes of clarification, the payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub for any
failure to comply with their respective obligations under Section 5.6 hereof.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if:

 

 

(a) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(g),

(b) (i) after the date of this Agreement, any bona fide Company Alternative

pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and (ii) concurrently with or within twelve (12)
months after such termination, any definitive agreement providing for a
Company Alternative Proposal (with each reference to "20%" in the definition
thereof replaced with "50%") shall have been entered into by the Company or a

47

arising in connection with any Regulatory Law) and, at the time of either
such termination, all of the conditions to closing set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.3 have been satisfied or waived in writing (or, if the Closing were to
have taken place on the date of termination, such conditions would have been
satisfied), other than the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b)(if the
injunction, restraint or prohibition relates to any Regulatory Law) or
Section 6.1(c), then Parent shall pay to the Company an amount in cash equal
to $750,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") within two (2) Business Days
of such termination.

 

 

Section 7.3 Amendment or Supplement. At any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
the Company and prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended
or supplemented in writing by the Company and Parent with respect to any of
the terms contained in this Agreement, except that following approval by
the stockholders of the Company there shall be no amendment or change to
the provisions hereof which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further approval nor any amendment or change not permitted under
applicable Law.

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

 

 

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein.

 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit,

otherwise indicated. The table of contents to this Agreement is for

has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
