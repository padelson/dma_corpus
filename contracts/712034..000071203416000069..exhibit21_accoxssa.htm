| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

The Independent Accountant must be agreed by the Vendors and the Purchasers.
If the Vendors and the Purchasers cannot agree within 10 Business Days of a

Independent Accountant.

|

If the Vendors or the Purchasers request that the ICA President nominate the

Accountant, being the dispute in relation to the Completion Accounts; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

the approximate value of, and the technical area involved in, the dispute. 

If the ICA President nominates a list of persons to be the Independent
Accountant rather than one particular person, the first person named on that
list will be the Independent Accountant.

| 
---|--- 

(f)

|

The disputed matters must be referred to the Independent Accountant by written
submission which must include the Completion Accounts, the Dispute Notice, the
Response and an extract of the relevant provisions of this agreement. The
Independent Accountant must also be instructed to finish its determination no
later than 20 Business Days after its appointment (or another period agreed by
the parties). 

| 
---|--- 

(g)

|

The parties must promptly supply the Independent Accountant with any
information, assistance and cooperation requested in writing by the
Independent Accountant in connection with its determination. All
correspondence between the Independent Accountant and a party must be copied
to the other parties. 

| 
---|--- 

(h)

|

The Independent Accountant must act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and
its written determination will be final and binding on the parties in the
absence of manifest error and the Completion Accounts will be deemed to be
amended accordingly and will be taken to comprise the final Completion
Accounts.

|

Gross‑up for Tax 

If the Vendors are liable to pay an amount to the Purchasers or any Group
Company pursuant to a Warranty Claim or an Indemnity Claim and:

| 
---|---

would have retained had the Tax or increased income tax not been payable or
the Tax relief not been lost.

|

Failure by the Purchasers to notify, or to procure that the relevant Group

(a)

|

engage in a business or an activity that is:

|

Interpretation 

Clauses 15.2, 15.3 and 15.40 have effect together as if they consisted of
separate provisions, each being severable from the other. Each separate
provision results from combining each undertaking in clause 15.2, with each
period in clause 15.3, and combining each of those combinations with each area
in clause 15.40. If any of those separate provisions is invalid or
unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability does not
affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other separate provisions
or other combinations of the separate provisions of clauses 15.2, 15.3 and | 
---|--- 

15.6
