(a) The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets shall be equal to
the sum of: (i) $10,500,000 in cash; plus (ii) a number of validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of Buyer (the "Shares")
equal to the quotient of $3,500,000 divided by the Buyer Average Stock Price
(the "Stock Consideration"); plus (iii) the Earnout Payment; and plus (iv)
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the "Purchase
Price"); provided, however, that (a) in the event the Buyer Average Stock
Price is greater than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Starting Price,
then the Stock Consideration shall be a number of Shares of Common Stock equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing $3,500,000 by the product of (i) the
Starting Price multiplied by (ii) 1.10, and (b) in the event the Buyer
Average Stock Price is less than 90 percent (90%) of the Starting Price, then
the Stock Consideration shall be a number of Shares of Common Stock equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing $3,500,000 by the product of (i) the
Starting Price multiplied by (ii) 0.90.

(b) At Closing, the Loan shall be credited to the cash portion of
the Purchase Price and Buyer shall (i) pay to Seller the remaining balance of
the cash portion of the Purchase Price, less the Cash Holdback, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Seller
and (ii) deposit the Cash Holdback to Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by Escrow Agent.

 

(c) At Closing, Shares in an amount equal to $3,500,000 as determined in

stock certificates evidencing the Retained Shares issued to Seller shall be
placed into escrow by Buyer with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement to be held and disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the date of this Agreement and at
or prior to the end of the Determination Period, the outstanding shares of
Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or type of
securities by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in
respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event
occurs, then the Shares will be adjusted accordingly to provide to the
holders thereof the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such adjustment event.

 



17 Section 2.06 _Earnouts_. As additional Purchase Price, at such times as
provided in this Section 2.06, Buyer shall pay Seller, the following earnout
payments subject to the terms of this Section 2.06: (i) the Cord Blood Cash
Earnout; (ii) the Cord Blood Stock Earnout; (iii) the Tianhe Sales Earnout;
(iv) the Tianhe Valuation Earnout; and (v) the Tianhe Recap Earnout
(collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Earnout Payments").

 

(a) _Earnout From Seller s Public Cord Blood Inventory_.

 

(i) _Cord Blood Cash Earnout_. Buyer shall pay to Seller 75% of all Net
Revenues received by Buyer (excluding any revenue related to any Excluded AR,
which shall be the exclusive property of Seller), net of any returns, during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the one-year
anniversary date of the Closing, and each year thereafter (each, an
"Evaluation Period"), from Buyers sale of Public Cord Blood Inventory in
excess of $500,000 (the "Cord Blood Cash Earnout"); provided that the maximum
aggregate Cord Blood Cash Earnout payable by Buyer to Seller shall not exceed
$200,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be entitled to retain
the entire first $500,000 of gross revenues earned during each Evaluation
Period from the sale of such Public Cord Blood Inventory. Subject to Section
2.06(d)(ii), payment of the Cord Blood Cash Earnout owed to Seller shall be
made in immediately available funds quarterly, within 30 days of the end of
the last month of each calendar quarter, until the Public Cord Blood
Inventory is exhausted. From and after the Closing, customers shall be
instructed to make all payments directly to Buyer and if Seller receives any
such payment from a customer, it shall promptly deliver it to Buyer. All such
gross revenues received by Buyer, including the initial $500,000 and the 25%
of additional gross revenues received by Buyer, shall hereinafter be referred
to as "Retained Gross Revenues."

 

(ii) _Cord Blood Stock Earnout_. In addition, for each Evaluation Period after
the Closing until the entire Public Cord Blood Inventory has been sold, for
every $500,000 of Retained Gross Revenues received by Buyer, net of any
returns, in excess of the initial $500,000 received and retained by Buyer
during such Evaluation Period (the "Revenue Benchmark"), Buyer shall deliver
to Seller a number of validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable shares of
Common Stock of Buyer (the "Cord Blood Stock Earnout") equal to the quotient
of $200,000 divided by the Buyer Average Stock Price at the closing of
trading on the trading day immediately prior to the date the Cord Blood Stock
Earnout is earned. The maximum aggregate amount of the Cord Blood Stock
Earnout shall not exceed an aggregate total value of $5,000,000 in Common
Stock. Subject to Section 2.06(d)(ii), the issuance of the Cord Blood Stock
Earnout owed to Seller shall be made quarterly, within 30 days of the end of
the last month of each calendar quarter, until the Public Cord Blood Inventory
is exhausted. For example, if in the 2018 Evaluation Period Buyer received
$1,000,000 of Retained Gross Revenues, Seller shall receive $200,000 of Common
Stock (as calculated in this Section 2.06(b)(ii)).

 

(b) _Earnout From Tianhe_.

 

(i) _Tianhe Sales Earnout_. If Buyer generates more than $500,000 in gross
profits from the sale of the Tianhe Capital Stock (whether in a single
transaction or series of transactions) (each, a "Tianhe Sale Event"), assuming
for this purpose that Buyer has a basis of

 



18  $0.43 per share in the Tianhe Capital Stock (the "Tianhe Stock Basis"),
Buyer shall pay to Seller seven percent (7%) of the gross profits derived from
such sale in excess of $500,000 in gross profits (collectively, the "Eligible
Profits"), payable to Seller in a number of validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock of Buyer (the "Tianhe Sales Earnout")
equal to the quotient of the dollar amount of the Eligible Profits divided by
the Buyer Average Stock Price at the closing of trading on the trading day
immediately prior to the date the Tianhe Sale Event. Subject to Section
2.06(d)(ii), the Tianhe Sales Earnout shall be paid in full no later than
thirty (30) calendar days following the closing of the Tianhe Sales Event. For
purposes of Section 2.06(c)(i), "gross profit" shall mean the gross sale price
of each share of Tianhe Stock sold pursuant to the Tianhe Sales Event _minus_
(x) the Tianhe Stock Basis and (y) all reasonable and documented transaction
expenses (paid to third parties) directly related to the sale of the Tianhe
Stock.

 

(ii) _Tianhe Valuation Earnout_. In the event a Tianhe Sale Event has not
occurred on or before the five year anniversary of the Closing Date, then
Buyer and Seller shall, within thirty (30) days of the expiration of such
five-year period, select the Independent Valuator to determine the fair market
value of the Tianhe Stock owned by Buyer (determined with regard to
any minority, control, liquidity or similar discounts, in the discretion of
the Independent Valuator) and Buyer shall pay Seller seven percent (7%) of the
gross profits (determined in the manner set forth in Section 2.06(c)(i)) that
would have been derived from a hypothetical sale of Tianhe Stock based on the
fair market value determined by the Independent Valuator (the "Eligible
Profits"), which shall be payable to Seller in a number of validly issued,
fully paid, and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of Buyer equal to the
quotient of the dollar amount of the Eligible Profits divided by the Buyer
Average Stock Price at the closing of trading on the trading day immediately
prior to the date the Independent Valuator determines the fair market value
of the Tianhe Stock, which shall be paid in full no later than thirty (30)
calendar days following the determination by the Independent Valuator of the
fair market value of the Tianhe Stock (the "Tianhe Valuation Earnout");
provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in Buyers sole discretion,
Buyer may, instead of issuing shares of its Common Stock, transfer seven
percent (7%) of its Tianhe Stock to Seller in full payment of the Tianhe
Valuation Earnout. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to select the
Independent Valuator within such thirty (30) day period and Buyer has
determined not to simply transfer seven percent (7%) of its Tianhe Stock to
Seller, then Buyer and Seller shall each prepare and deliver to each other a
list of three reputable independent investment banking firms. The Independent
Valuator shall then be selected by lot from the reputable independent
investment banking firms on the lists submitted by Buyer and Seller. Buyer
and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with the Independent Valuator in order
to facilitate the valuation of the Tianhe Stock. The determination by the
Independent Valuator of the fair market value of the Tianhe Stock shall be
final and binding on Buyer and Seller. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Valuator shall be borne 50/50 by Buyer and Seller. For purposes of
Section 2.06(c)(ii), "gross profit" shall mean the difference between (a) the
Tianhe Stock Basis and (b) the fair market value of each share of Tianhe Stock
as determined by the Independent Valuator.

 

(iii) _Tianhe Recap Earnout_. Additionally, if Buyer, at any time after the
Closing Date, purchases additional shares of Tianhe Stock so that its
aggregate holdings exceeds a majority percentage interest of the capital stock
of Tianhe (the "Tianhe Recap Event"), Buyer shall also pay to Seller an
additional amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the value (based on 

 



19  the purchase price paid by Buyer) of such additional shares of Tianhe Stock
equal to the difference between the shares of Tianhe Stock delivered to Buyer
at Closing and the additional shares of Tianhe Stock acquired thereafter (the
"Recap Value"), payable to Seller in a number of validly issued, fully paid,
and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of Buyer (the "Tianhe Recap Earnout")
equal to the quotient of the Recap Value divided by the Buyer Average Stock
Price at the closing of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the
date of the Tianhe Recap Event. Subject to Section 2.06(d)(ii), the Tianhe
Recap Earnout shall be paid in full no later than thirty (30) calendar days
following the closing of the Tianhe Recap Event.

(c) _Procedures Applicable to Determination of the Earnout Payments_.

(i) On or before the date which is thirty (30) calendar days after: (A) the
last day of each Evaluation Period with respect to the determination of gross
revenues and/or Retained Gross Revenue derived from the sale of Public Cord
Blood Inventory; (B) the closing date of any Tianhe Sales Event; or (C) the
closing date of any Tianhe Recap Event (each such date, an "Earnout
Calculation Delivery Date"), Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
written statement (in each case, an "Earnout Calculation Statement") setting
forth in reasonable detail its determination of (1) gross revenues and/or
Retained Gross Revenue with respect to the sale of Public Cord Blood
Inventory, (2) the Eligible Profit, and/or (3) the Recap Value, as applicable,
and the calculation of the applicable Earnout Payment for the applicable
Evaluation Period, Tianhe Sales Event, and/or Tianhe Recap Event, as
applicable (in each case, an "Earnout Calculation").

 

(ii) Seller shall have thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Earnout
Calculation Statement for each applicable Earnout Payment (in each case, the
"Review Period") to review the Earnout Calculation Statement and the Earnout
Calculation set forth therein. During the Review Period, Seller shall have the
right to inspect Buyers books and records and have access to relevant
employees during normal business hours at Buyers offices, upon reasonable
prior notice and solely for purposes reasonably related to the determinations
of gross revenues and/or Retained Gross Revenue with respect to the sale of
Public Cord Blood Inventory, the Eligible Profit, and/or the Recap Value, as
applicable, and the resulting Earnout Payment and Buyer shall provide Seller
with such additional information reasonably requested by Seller to confirm
that Buyers determination of gross revenues and/or Retained Gross Revenue
with respect to the sale of Public Cord Blood Inventory, the Eligible Profit,
and/or the Recap Value, as applicable, and the resulting Earnout Payment.
Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Seller may object to the
Earnout Calculation set forth in the Earnout Calculation Statement for the
applicable Earnout Payment by delivering a written notice of objection (an
"Earnout Calculation Objection Notice") to Buyer. Any Earnout Calculation
Objection Notice shall specify the items in the applicable Earnout Calculation
disputed by Seller and shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection, as well as the amount in dispute. If Seller fails to deliver an
Earnout Calculation Objection Notice to Buyer prior to the expiration of the
Review Period, then the Earnout Calculation set forth in the Earnout
Calculation Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Seller
timely delivers an Earnout Calculation Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the disputed items and agree upon the
resulting amount of the gross revenues and/or Retained Gross Revenue with
respect to the sale of Public Cord Blood Inventory, the Eligible Profit,
and/or the Recap Value, as applicable, and the Earnout Payment for the
applicable period. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach agreement

 



20  within twenty (20) calendar days after such an Earnout Calculation Objection
Notice has been given, then Buyer and Seller shall, within ten (10) days of
the expiration of such twenty-day period, select the Independent Valuator and
all unresolved disputed items shall be promptly referred to the Independent
Valuator. The Independent Valuator shall be directed to render a written
report on the unresolved disputed items with respect to the applicable
Earnout Calculation as promptly as practicable, but in no event greater than
thirty (30) calendar days after such submission to the Independent Valuator,
and to resolve only those unresolved disputed items set forth in the Earnout
Calculation Objection Notice. If unresolved disputed items are submitted to
the Independent Valuator, Buyer and Seller shall each furnish to the
Independent Valuator such work papers, schedules and other documents and
information relating to the unresolved disputed items as the Independent
Valuator may reasonably request. The Independent Valuator shall resolve the
disputed items based solely on the applicable definitions and other terms
in this Agreement and the presentations by Buyer and Seller, and not by
independent review. The resolution of the dispute and the calculation of the
gross revenues and/or Retained Gross Revenue with respect to the sale of
Public Cord Blood Inventory, the Eligible Profit, and/or the Recap Value,
that is the subject of the applicable Earnout Calculation Objection Notice by
the Independent Valuator shall be final and binding on the Parties. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Valuator shall be borne 50/50 by Buyer and
Seller. Any Earnout Payment subject to any Earnout Calculation Objection
Notice shall be paid in full no later than 10 Business Days following the
final resolution of any such dispute (whether by agreement between Buyer
and Seller or upon determination by the Independent Valuator).

(d) _Covenants of Buyer_. Until all of the Earnout Payments have been paid,
if earned, in full, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, generally
consistent with the manner in which Seller conducted its business prior to
Closing, and act in good faith, to sell the Public Cord Blood Inventory and to
collect the revenues due to Buyer in connection with such sales in the
ordinary course of business. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall
deliver invoices related to the sale of Public Cord Blood Inventory within ten
(10) Business Days of making a sale and use commercially reasonable efforts
to collect the accounts receivable related thereto. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller (which
will not be unreasonably withheld):

 

(i) Fail to take any action that would be reasonably required by reasonable,
skillful, prudent, and diligent persons engaged in the provision of services
similar to the Business, to the extent it negatively affects the Cord Blood
Cash Earnout or the Cord Blood Stock Earnout;

(ii) Fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell the
Public Cord Blood Inventory;

(iii) Declare a dividend or make any other distribution to Buyers
stockholders of any shares of Tianhe Stock;

(iv) Breach any Assigned Contract directly or indirectly related to the
provision of the Business solely related to the Public Cord Blood Inventory
(including, but not limited to, any customer contracts), or take or fail to
take any action, which, as a result of the passage of time or otherwise,
would cause a breach of any such Assigned Contracts, including,

 



21  without limitation, any failure to comply and maintain in full force and
effect that certain (A) National Marrow Donor Program Cord Blood Bank
Participation Agreement by and between Seller and the National Marrow Donor
Program, effective May 1, 2006, as amended by that certain Amendment Cord
Blood Bank Participation Agreement, effective July 1, 2011, as further amended
by that certain Amendment Cord Blood Bank Participation Agreement, effective
March 1, 2014, as further amended by that certain Amendment Cord Blood Bank
Participation Agreement, effective March 1, 2015, including all other
amendments, including, without limitation, any amended fee schedules (the
"NMDP Agreement"), or (B) that certain Contract by and between Seller and
HRSA/OFM/DFM Division of Procurement Management (Contract No. HHSH
25020090019C) dated August 31, 2009, as amended on July 1, 2014 (the "HRSA
Agreement");

(v) Alter or change, directly or indirectly, the character of the Business
solely related to the Public Cord Blood Inventory or alter or amend any
contract or agreement entered into in connection with such Business that could
materially affect the ability to achieve the Cord Blood Cash Earnout or the
Cord Blood Stock Earnout;

 

(vi) Do all things reasonable necessary to maintain the corporate existence of
Buyer;

 

(vii) Fail to ensure that any purchaser of Buyer (whether by assignment of
stock, purchase of substantially all the assets or by operation of law
(including any merger)) expressly assume all of Buyers obligations and
Liabilities associated with the Earnout Payments;

(viii) Fail to obtain and maintain in good standing the Cord Blood Approvals
(as hereinafter defined) on the terms set forth in Section 6.24; or

 

(ix) Violate any applicable Laws or Permits, or fail to maintain any such
Permits in good standing, except to the extent that such violation or failure
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business solely related to the
Public Cord Blood Inventory;

provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Buyer may
renegotiate or terminate the Duke Agreement (after providing any required
notices to Duke), at any time after the Closing.

 

(e) _Cessation of Public Cord Blood_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event Buyer determines to
cease selling of the Public Cord Blood Inventory, then Buyer shall provide
Seller with a right of first offer to accept: (1) all of the remaining Public
Cord Blood Inventory, including, without limitation, all freezers associated
with any such Public Cord Blood Inventory, all related maternal
sample freezers, and all other related equipment associated with any such
Public Cord Blood Inventory, free and clear of all Encumbrances; and (2) all
books and records associated with the Public Cord Blood Inventory and related
equipment (collectively, the "Public Cord Blood Assets"). If Buyer proposes
to cease to sell the Public Cord Blood Inventory, Buyer shall deliver a
written notice offering to transfer the Public Cord Blood Assets for
consideration already received by Buyer and for no additional consideration
from Seller (the "Cord Blood Reversion Offer"). Seller may accept the Cord
Blood Reversion Offer at any time within thirty

 



22  (30) calendar days of the date of its receipt of the Cord Blood Reversion
Offer (the "Cord Blood Reversion Acceptance Period") by providing Buyer with a
written notice of acceptance (the "Cord Blood Reversion Acceptance"). The
closing of the transfer of the Public Cord Blood Assets subject to the Cord
Blood Reversion Offer (the "Cord Blood Reversion Closing") will take place on
a date specified in writing by Seller no later than one (1) year of the date
of the Cord Blood Reversion Offer (the "Cord Blood Reversion Closing Date"),
which date shall be specified by Seller at least thirty (30) calendar days
prior to such Cord Blood Reversion Closing Date.

(ii) Subject to 2.06(e)(v), if Seller timely accepts the Cord Blood Reversion
Offer, then, until the Cord Blood Reversion Closing Date, Buyer shall
continue, on behalf of Seller, to sell the Public Cord Blood Inventory in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and all gross
proceeds (net of returns) of such sales shall belong and be paid, on a
monthly basis, exclusively to Seller. Buyer shall deliver a monthly itemized
invoice documenting all direct costs and expenses associated with storing and
distributing such Public Cord Blood Inventory (including the payment
obligations arising under the NMDP Agreement, the HRSA Agreement, and, after
termination of the Duke Agreement, the Duke Agreement). Seller shall pay all
invoiced amounts due to Buyer by check mailed to Buyer pursuant to Section
10.02 within thirty (30) calendar days from Sellers receipt of such invoice,
except for any amounts disputed by Seller in good faith. Seller shall notify
Buyer in writing of any dispute with any invoice within fifteen (15) calendar
days from Sellers receipt of such invoice. Buyer and Seller shall seek to
resolve all such disputes expeditiously and in good faith. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, Buyer shall continue performing its obligations
under this Agreement during any such dispute and Seller shall not be in breach
of this Section 2.06(e) while such amounts remain in dispute by Seller in good
faith. From and after the date of the Cord Blood Reversion Acceptance,
the Cord Blood Cash Earnout and Cord Blood Stock Earnout shall terminate and
Buyer shall no longer be obligated to pay any Cord Blood Cash Earnout or Cord
Blood Stock Earnout, other than amounts that became payable prior to the Cord
Blood Reversion Acceptance and all of the gross proceeds from the sale of
Public Cord Blood Inventory payable by Buyer to Seller pursuant to this
Section 2.06(e)(ii).

 

(iii) At the Cord Blood Reversion Closing, Buyer and Seller shall enter into:
(1) mutually acceptable transfer documents, which shall include, without
limitation: (A) a representation and warranty from Buyer that the Public Cord
Blood Reversion Assets are being transferred to Seller free and clear of
Encumbrances; (B) a representation and warranty from Buyer identical
to Section 4.09; and (C) a representation and warranty from Buyer identical
to Section 4.12(b); and (2) a mutually acceptable transition services
agreement pursuant to which Buyer shall agree to provide storage and other
logistical support and services reasonably related to the transfer of such
public cord blood business to Seller for the time period specified in such
agreement, but not more than 30 days, in consideration for a reasonable fee to
be determined by Buyer and Seller.

(iv) From and after the Cord Blood Reversion Closing: (X) the Cord Blood Cash
Earnout and the Cord Blood Stock Earnout shall each terminate and be of no
further force or effect and Buyer shall no longer be bound by the provisions
of Section 2.06(a) or Section 2.06(d)(i), (ii), (iv), (v), (viii), and (ix);
and (Y) neither Seller nor any Key Person or other shareholder of Seller who
has entered into any non-competition and non-solicitation agreement

 



23  with Buyer, shall continue to be bound by the provisions of Section 6.08(a)
(Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation) or such other non-competition and non-
solicitation agreement, as applicable, but only with regard to the
public cord blood business and sale of any Public Cord Blood Inventory.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall no longer be obligated to pay any
Cord Blood Cash Earnout or Cord Blood Stock Earnout after the Cord Blood
Reversion Closing, other than amounts that became payable prior to the Cord
Blood Reversion Closing, and for the avoidance of doubt, any Earnout Payments
previously paid by Buyer to Seller in respect to either the Cord Blood Cash
Earnout or the Cord Blood Stock Earnout shall remain the exclusive property
of Seller.

(v) If Seller does not timely deliver the Cord Blood Reversion Acceptance or
fails to close on the transfer to Seller of the Public Cord Blood Assets
within the Cord Blood Reversion Acceptance Period or affirmatively rejects the
Cord Blood Reversion Offer or breaches its obligation to reimburse Buyer as
required by Section 2.06(e)(ii) (provided such payment is not being disputed
by Seller in good faith) and such breach continues uncured for more than sixty
(60) days after the date such reimbursement payment is due pursuant
to Section 2.06(e)(ii), then Buyer may cease its efforts to sell the Public
Cord Blood Inventory, and thereafter, in its reasonable discretion, may
attempt to sell the remaining Public Cord Blood Inventory in a bulk sale to a
blood bank that is in compliance with HRSA or, after January 1, 2023, may
discard the remaining Public Cord Blood Inventory, without being in breach of
this Agreement, and Buyer shall no longer be bound by the provisions of
Section 2.06(d)(i), (ii), (iv), (v), (viii), and (ix), and shall be permitted
(but shall not be required) to offer the Public Cord Blood Assets for sale to
any third party not affiliated with Buyer in a bulk sale or otherwise;
provided, however, that if Buyer sells any remaining Public Cord Blood
Inventory, Buyer shall continue to remain obligated to pay to Seller the Cord
Blood Cash Earnout and the Cord Blood Stock Earnout with regard to such sale,
if any, in connection with all of the Net Revenue received from the sale of
the Public Cord Blood Assets regardless of the form of any ultimate sale
transaction.

Section 2.07  _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Buyer agree that the
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (plus other relevant items) shall
be allocated among the Purchased Assets for all purposes (including Tax and
financial accounting) as shown on the allocation schedule (the "Allocation
Schedule"). A draft of the Allocation Schedule shall be prepared by Buyer and
delivered to Seller within 30 days following the Closing Date. If Seller
notifies Buyer in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of the Allocation
Schedule that Seller objects to one or more items reflected in the Allocation
Schedule, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute; _provided, however_ , that if Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve
any dispute with respect to the Allocation Schedule within 60 days following
the Closing Date, such dispute shall be resolved by an independent accountant
mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. Buyer and Seller
shall file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund)
and information reports in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule. 

 



24 Section 2.08 _Withholding Tax_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Purchase Price all Taxes that Buyer is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to such payment under any applicable provision of
Tax Law taking into account any applicable exemption under such Laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer believes that any withholding is so
required, then it shall give written notice to Seller at least five (5)
Business Days prior to making such withholding, and it shall provide Seller a
reasonable opportunity during such five (5) Business Day period to provide
any applicable certificates, forms or documentation that would reduce or
eliminate, and will otherwise cooperate with Seller and take such steps as
Seller may reasonably request to reduce or eliminate, the requirement to
withhold Tax under applicable Law. All such withheld amounts shall be treated
as delivered to Seller hereunder and Buyer shall timely remit such amounts to
the appropriate Governmental Authority.

 

Section 2.09 _Third Party Consents_. To the extent that Sellers rights under
any Contract or Permit constituting a Purchased Asset, or any other Purchased
Asset, may not be assigned to Buyer without the consent of another Person
which has not been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach
thereof or be unlawful, and Seller, at its expense, not to exceed $5,000 in
the aggregate, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
such required consent(s) as promptly as possible. If any such consent shall
not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would be ineffective or would
impair Buyers rights under the Purchased Asset in question so that Buyer
would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights, Seller, to
the maximum extent permitted by law, shall act, for a period not to exceed
six (6) months after the Closing, as Buyers agent in order to obtain for it
the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law, with Buyer in any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide
such benefits to Buyer. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 2.09 to
the contrary, Buyer shall not be deemed to have waived its rights under
Section 7.02(d) hereof unless and until Buyer either provides written waivers
thereof or elects to proceed to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement at Closing.

declarations, filings or notices which, in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, no consent, approval, Permit, Governmental Order,

(d) Unless otherwise disclosed in Section 4.11(d) of the Disclosure Schedules,
neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the

(b) All Permits required for Seller to conduct the Business as currently
conducted (including for the storage of blood and tissue units) or for the
ownership and use of the Purchased Assets have been obtained by Seller, except
for those Permits the failure to so hold would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, and are valid and in full force and effect.

(a) The operations of Seller with respect to the Business and the Purchased
Assets are in compliance with all Environmental Laws, except where the
failure to be in such compliance would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedules,

obligations or requirements as of the Closing Date.

(b) There has been no Release of Hazardous Materials in contravention of
Environmental Law with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, any Leased Real Property, and Seller has not received
an Environmental Notice that the Business or the Purchased Assets or any
Leased Real Property has been contaminated with any Hazardous Material which
would reasonably be expected to result in an Environmental Claim against, or a
violation of Environmental Law or term of any Environmental Permit by, Seller.

 

(c) The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.18 are
Sellers sole and exclusive representations and warranties regarding
environmental matters.

Section 4.19 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Section 4.19(a) of the Disclosure Schedules contains a true and complete
list of each pension, benefit, retirement, compensation, employment,
consulting, profit-sharing, deferred compensation, incentive, bonus,
performance award, phantom equity, stock or stock-based, change in control,
retention, severance, vacation, paid time off (PTO), medical, vision, dental,
disability, welfare, Code Section 125 cafeteria, fringe-benefit and other
similar agreement, plan, policy, program or arrangement (and any amendments
thereto), in each case whether or not reduced to writing and whether funded or
unfunded, including each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, whether or not tax-qualified and whether or not subject
to ERISA, which is or has been maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or
required to be contributed to by Seller for the benefit of any Key Employee or
any spouse or dependent of such individual, or under which Seller or any of
its ERISA Affiliates has or may have any Liability, or with respect to which
Buyer or any of its Affiliates would reasonably be expected to have any
Liability, contingent or otherwise (as listed on Section 4.19(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules, each, a "Benefit Plan").

 

(b) The plan administrator for the retirement plan that is qualified within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code that is maintained by the Buyer
(the "Buyers Qualified Plan") may reasonably conclude that a potential
rollover contribution to the Buyers Qualified Plan with

 



38  respect to any current or former employee of the Business from each Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code is a "valid rollover contribution" under Treasury Regulation Section
1.401(a)(31)-1, QandA-14(b)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a breach of this
Section 4.19(b) shall not occur if the plan administrator of the Buyers
Qualified Plan later determines that the contribution from a Benefit Plan that
is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
was an "invalid rollover contribution" under Treasury Regulation Section
1.401(a)(31)-1, QandA-14(b)(1), and fails to distribute to the participant
within a reasonable time after such determination (as contemplated under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(31)-1, QandA-14(a)), the amount of the
invalid rollover contribution, plus any earnings attributable thereto.

(c) With respect to each Benefit Plan (i) no such plan is a multiemployer plan
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each a "Multiemployer Plan").

Section 4.20 _Employment Matters_.

or part-time); (iii) hire or retention date; (iv) current annual base
compensation rate or contract fee; (v) commission, bonus or other incentive-
based compensation; and (vi) a description of the fringe benefits provided to
each such individual as of the date hereof. Except as set forth in Section
4.20(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, as of the date hereof, all compensation,
including wages, commissions, bonuses, fees and other compensation, payable to

understandings or commitments of Seller with respect to any compensation,
commissions, bonuses or fees.

 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.20(b) of the Disclosure Schedules, Seller

benefits, immigration, wages, hours, overtime compensation, child labor,
hiring, promotion and termination of employees, working conditions, meal and
break periods, privacy, health and safety, workers compensation, leaves of
absence, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, except to the extent non-

Effect. There are no Actions against Seller pending, or to the Sellers
Knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed, by or with any Governmental
Authority or arbitrator in connection with the

 



39  employment of any current or former applicant or employee of the Business,
including, without limitation, any charge, to the Sellers Knowledge,
investigation, or claim relating to unfair labor practices, equal employment
opportunities, fair employment practices, employment discrimination,
harassment, retaliation, reasonable accommodation, disability rights or
benefits, immigration, wages, hours, overtime compensation,
employee classification, child labor, hiring, promotion and termination of
employees, working conditions, meal and break periods, privacy, health and
safety, workers compensation, leaves of absence, paid sick leave,
unemployment insurance or any other employment related matter arising under
applicable Laws.

(d) The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.20
are Sellers sole and exclusive representations and warranties regarding
employment matters.

Section 4.21  _Taxes_.

Except as set forth in Section 4.21 of the Disclosure Schedules:

(g) Seller is not a "foreign Person" as that term is used in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2.

(h) Seller is not, and has not been, a party to, or a promoter of,

40 (i) None of the Purchased Assets is (i) required to be treated as being owned
by another Person pursuant to the so-called "safe harbor lease" provisions of
former Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended,

Section 4.21 shall be deemed to apply directly or indirectly with respect to
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.21, Seller does not
make any representation as to the amount of, or present or future limitations
on, any net operating losses, Tax credits or other Tax attributes that it may

finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission contingent on the closing of, or otherwise related to, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document based

Section 4.23 _Investment Representations_.

 

(a) Seller: (a) is acquiring the Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement for
Sellers own account, and not as a nominee or agent, with the present
intention of holding the Common Stock for purposes of investment, and Seller
has no intention of selling the Common Stock in a public distribution in
violation of the Federal securities Law or any applicable State securities
Law; (b) is an "accredited investor" for purposes of U.S. Federal securities
Laws; (c) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the
Buyer and its Common Stock; and (d) is able to bear the economic risks of an
investment in the Common Stock and could afford a complete loss of such
investment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may, subject to the lock-up
set forth in Section 6.22, in its sole discretion, make a distribution of the
Common Stock issued to Seller in connection with this Agreement to its
existing stockholders pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

(b) Seller hereby acknowledges that the Common Stock will not be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any
state securities laws on the grounds that the issuance of the Common Stock is
exempt from registration pursuant exemptions available under the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws, and that the reliance of the Buyer
on such exemptions is predicated in part on the Sellers representations,
warranties, covenants and acknowledgments set forth in this Section 4.23.
Seller further acknowledges that the Common Stock may be sold or transferred
by Seller only if, among other things, it is subsequently registered under the
applicable Federal and State securities Law or an exemption from such
registration is available. Seller further acknowledges that the Common
Stock will bear a customary legend to the foregoing effect.

 



41 (c) Subject to those representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in
Article V, Seller has made its own evaluation of the Common Stock and the
business of Buyer based upon information determined by Seller to be
sufficiently complete and reliable for such purposes and has not relied on any
other representations or statements made by Buyer. Seller has been furnished
all materials relating to any other matter that Seller has requested and has
been afforded an ample opportunity to ask questions and receive answers
concerning the Common Stock and to obtain any additional information
which Buyer possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense
that is necessary for it to enter into this Agreement. Seller has had an
opportunity to review Buyers public filings made with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which can be located at
_https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm_. Without limiting the
foregoing, Seller has reviewed the Risk Factors contained in Buyers filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, Seller
has conducted such investigation of Buyers business as it has deemed
necessary in order to make an informed decision concerning its investment in
the Common Stock. For the purpose of conducting these investigations, Seller
has employed the services of its own agents, representatives, experts and
consultants.

Section 4.24 _Privacy and Data Security_. Seller is, and to Sellers
Knowledge, at all times has been, in material compliance with (a) all
applicable Laws regarding the protection, storage, use, disclosure, and
transfer of Personal Data, including the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS); and (b) all contracts (or portions thereof)
between Seller and its vendors, marketing affiliates, and other customers and
business partners that are applicable to the use and disclosure of Personal
Data (such contracts hereinafter referred to as "Privacy Agreements").
Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement will
result in any material violation of any Privacy Agreements, or any applicable
Law pertaining to privacy or Personal Data. Seller has reasonable safeguards
in place to protect Personal Data in such Sellers possession or control from
unauthorized access by third persons, including Sellers employees and
contractors. To the Knowledge of Seller, no Person has made any illegal or
unauthorized use of Personal Data that was collected by or on behalf of Seller
and is or was in the possession or control of Seller that would be material
to the Business. Seller has not received any written claim, complaint,
inquiry, or notice from any third party or any Governmental Authority or self-
regulatory authority or entity related to such Sellers
collection, processing, use, storage, security, and/or disclosure of Personal
Data that (x) Seller is in violation of any applicable Law or privacy policy,
or (y) otherwise constitutes an unfair, deceptive, or misleading trade
practice. The representations and warranties set forth in this Section 4.24
are Sellers sole and exclusive representations and warranties regarding
privacy and data security.

 



42 Section 4.25 _Solvency_. Seller is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud any Person to which Seller is, or may
become, indebted. The Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities are not less
than the reasonably equivalent value of the Purchased Assets. After the
Closing and after giving effect to this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, Seller will not be insolvent (either because its
financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair
value of its assets or because the present fair salable value of its assets
will be less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on debts
as they become absolute and matured).

 

Section 4.26 _HIPAA_. Sellers engagement in the public cord blood business
does not make Seller a "covered entity" as that term is defined under HIPAA.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller is aware of and acknowledges HIPAA, and
Seller is in compliance in all material respects with HIPAA, to the extent
applicable to Seller. To the extent that Seller is or has acted as a
"business associate" (as defined under HIPAA) of an entity, a valid and
binding Business Associate Agreement ("BAA") has been in force between each
such entity and Seller at all pertinent times, and each such BAA has
established the permitted and required uses and disclosures of "protected
health information" (as that term is defined in HIPAA). Seller is, and at all
pertinent times has been, in compliance in all material respects with any
such BAA. Seller has not received any written complaint, nor, to the Knowledge
of the Seller, has any complaint been made by any Person regarding the
improper use or disclosure of such Persons protected health information by
Seller or any of its Representatives. The representations and warranties set
forth in this Section 4.26 are Sellers sole and exclusive representations and
warranties regarding HIPAA.

 

Section 4.27 _Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws_.

 

(a) Neither Seller, nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, any executive officer or
director of Seller has, directly or indirectly, taken any action that as of
the Closing would cause them to be in violation of: (i) the principles set out
in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on
Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
Business Transactions; (ii) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended, or any rules or regulations thereunder; and (iii) any other
applicable anti-corruption and/or anti-bribery laws, statutes, rules,
regulations, ordinances, judgments, orders, decrees, injunctions, and writs
of any Governmental Authority of any jurisdiction applicable to Seller
(whether by virtue of jurisdiction or organization or conduct of business)
(collectively, the "Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws").

(b) Neither Seller, nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, any executive officer or
director of Seller has unlawfully offered, paid, promised to pay, or
authorized a payment, of any corporate funds of Seller or other thing of value
(including any fee, gift, sample, travel expense or entertainment) related to
political activity, to any of the following persons for the purpose of
illegally influencing any act or decision of such person in his or her
official capacity, inducing such person to do or omit to do any act in
violation of the lawful duty of such official, securing any improper
advantage, or unlawfully inducing such person to use his or her influence
with a foreign government or instrumentality thereof to affect or to influence
any act or decision of such

 



43  government or instrumentality, in order to assist Seller in obtaining or
retaining business for or with, or directing the business to, any Person: (i)
any person who is an agent, representative, official, officer, director, or
employee of any non-U.S. government or any department, agency, or
instrumentality thereof (including officers, directors, and employees of
state-owned, operated or controlled entities) or of a public international
organization; (ii) any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf
of any such government, department, agency, instrumentality, or public
international organization; (iii) any political party or official thereof; or
(iv) any candidate for political or political party office (such recipients in
paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this subsection
collectively, "Government Officials").

(c) Neither the Seller, nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, any executive officer
or director of Seller, has made any payments or transfers of any corporate
funds of Seller with the intent, or that have the purpose or effect, of
engaging in commercial bribery, or acceptance of or acquiescence in kickbacks
or other unlawful means of obtaining business.

Section 4.28 _Exclusivity of Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE IV, NEITHER SELLER NOR ANY
OTHER PERSON MAKES (AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS) ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE AS TO THE CONDITION, VALUE

DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE,

CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE IV, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NONE OF SELLER, ITS
STOCKHOLDERS OR ANY OTHER PERSON ON BEHALF OF SELLER MAKES ANY OTHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO SELLER OR WITH RESPECT
TO ANY OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED, IF ANY, TO BUYER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES
OR REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF SUCH INFORMATION.
NEITHER SELLER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON WILL HAVE OR BE SUBJECT TO ANY LIABILITY
OR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION TO BUYER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES, OR ANY OTHER PERSON RESULTING FROM THE DISTRIBUTION TO BUYER
OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES, OR BUYERS
AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES USE OF ANY INFORMATION, DOCUMENTS,
PROJECTIONS, FORECASTS OR OTHER 

 



44  MATERIAL MADE AVAILABLE TO BUYER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES
IN THE DATA ROOM OR MANAGEMENT PRESENTATIONS OR OTHERWISE IN EXPECTATION OF
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DISCUSSION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION.

(b) SELLER DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO BUYER EXCEPT AS
CONTAINED IN ARTICLE IV, AND ANY AND ALL STATEMENTS MADE OR INFORMATION
COMMUNICATED BY SELLER OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES OUTSIDE OF THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING BY WAY OF THE DOCUMENTS PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO PARENTS WRITTEN
DILIGENCE REQUEST AND ANY MANAGEMENT PRESENTATIONS PROVIDED), WHETHER VERBALLY
OR IN WRITING, ARE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SUPERSEDED BY THIS AGREEMENT, IT BEING

AGREEMENT.

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, Buyer represents and warrants
to Seller that the statements contained in this Article V are true and
correct as of the date hereof.

Section 5.01 _Organization of Buyer_. Buyer is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the state of Delaware
and has full corporate power and authority to own, operate or lease the
properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it and to carry on its
business as currently conducted. Section 5.01 of the Disclosure Schedules
sets forth each jurisdiction in which Buyer is licensed or qualified to do
business, and Buyer is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership of its assets or
the operation of its business as currently conducted makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.02 _Authority of Buyer_. Buyer has full corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which
Buyer is a party, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution
and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and any Ancillary Document to which
Buyer is a party, the performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Buyer, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
Seller) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer enforceable against Buyer

 



45  in accordance with its terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting creditors rights and
remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles
of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at
law or in equity). When each Ancillary Document to which Buyer is or will be
a party has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto), such
Ancillary Document will constitute a legal and binding obligation of Buyer
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability,
to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 

Section 5.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_. The execution, delivery and performance
by Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is a
party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, do not and will not: (a) conflict with or result in a violation or
breach of, or default under, any provision of the certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of Buyer or (b)
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Law
(including federal and state securities laws and regulations) or Governmental
Order applicable to Buyer or require the consent, notice or other action by
any Person under any Contract to which Buyer is a party. No consent, approval,
Permit, Governmental Order, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any
Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to Buyer in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, except for such consents, approvals, Permits, Governmental Orders,
declarations, filings or notices which, in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.04 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission contingent on the closing
of, or otherwise related to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Document based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Buyer.

 

Section 5.05 _Sufficiency of Funds_. Buyer has sufficient cash on hand and
immediately available funds to enable it to make payment of the Purchase
Price and the Earnout Payments, and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyers
performance of its obligations under this Agreement is not in any way
contingent upon the availability of financing to Buyer.

 



46 Section 5.06 _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in Section 5.06 of the
Disclosure Schedules or its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018,
there are no Actions pending or, to Buyers Knowledge, threatened against or
by Buyer (a) relating to or affecting Buyer; or (b) that challenge or seek to
prevent, enjoin or otherwise delay the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 5.06 of the Disclosure Schedules or
its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018, there are no
outstanding Governmental Orders and no unsatisfied judgments, penalties or
awards against, relating to or affecting the business of Buyer. Buyer is
in compliance with the terms of each Governmental Order set forth in Section
5.06 of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

Section 5.07 _Compliance With Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.07(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, Buyer
is in compliance with all Laws applicable to the conduct of its business as
currently conducted or the ownership and use of its assets, except where the
failure to be compliant would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) All Permits required for Buyer to conduct its business as currently
conducted (including for the storage of blood and tissue units) or for the
ownership and use of its assets have been obtained by Buyer, except for those
Permits the failure to so hold would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and are valid and in full force and effect. All fees
and charges with respect to such Permits as of the date hereof have been paid
in full. Section 5.07(b) of the Disclosure Schedules lists all current
material Permits issued to Buyer which are related to the conduct of its
business as currently conducted or the ownership and use of its assets,
including the names of the Permits and their respective dates of issuance and
expiration, including without limitation the Sellers U.S. Food and Drug
Administration registration and licenses.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties
contained in this Section 5.07 do not apply to legal proceedings and
governmental order matters, which subject matters are addressed in their
entirety and exclusively in Section 5.06.

 

Section 5.08 _Solvency_. As of the Closing Date and immediately after giving
effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the payment of the Purchase Price and any Earnout Payment, and all of the
related fees and expenses of Buyer in connection therewith, (a) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of Buyer will exceed (i) the value of
all Liabilities of Buyer, including contingent and other Liabilities, and (ii)
the amount that will be required to pay the probable Liabilities of Buyer on
their existing debts (including contingent Liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and matured; (b) the Buyer will not have an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged; and (c) Buyer will be able to pay its Liabilities,
including contingent and other Liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its Liabilities, including contingent and other Liabilities,
as they mature" means that Buyer will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due, including the making of any Earnout
Payment.

 



47 Section 5.09 _Disclosure Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Common Stock of Buyer is registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Buyer
has taken no action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to have
the effect of, terminating the registration of the Common Stock of Buyer under
the Exchange Act nor has Buyer received any notification that the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is contemplating terminating
such registration. Buyer has timely filed all forms, proxy statements,
reports, schedules and other documents, including all certifications and
statements required by the Exchange Act or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 required to be filed by the Exchange Act since January 1, 2015
(the "Buyer Exchange Act Reports"). The Buyer Exchange Act Reports (i) at the
time filed, (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the securities laws and other
applicable laws and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or, if amended
or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the
date of such amended or superseded filing) contain any untrue statement of
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each offering or
sale of securities by Buyer (i) was either registered under the Securities Act
or made pursuant to a valid exemption from registration, (ii) complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the securities laws and
other applicable laws, except for immaterial late "blue sky" filings,
including disclosure and broker/dealer registration requirements, and (iii)
was made pursuant to offering documents, which did not, at the time of the
offering (or, in the case of registration statements, at the effective date
thereof) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated in the offering documents or necessary to
make the statements in such documents, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) All of the financial statements of Buyer included in its Form 10-K filed
with the SEC on February 28, 2018, and each of its Form 10-Q filings filed
with the SEC on April 13, 2017, July 7, 2017, and October 16, 2017, including
any related notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects, subject in the case of unaudited financial statements to
normal year-end adjustments and the absence of notes, and present fairly in
all material respects the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of Buyer and its subsidiaries as of the dates and
for the periods indicated therein.

 

Section 5.10 _Internal Accounting Controls_. The Buyer and its subsidiaries
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (c) access to assets is permitted
only in accordance with managements general or

 



48  specific authorization, and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. Buyer has established
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) for Buyer and designed such disclosure controls and procedures
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Buyer in the reports it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.
Since the date of the filing of Buyers Form 10-K with the SEC on February 28,
2018, there have been no changes in Buyers internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act) that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Buyers internal
control over financial reporting.

 

Section 5.11 _Absence of Changes_. Since December 31, 2017, there has been no
change in the business, assets, liabilities, prospects, results of operations
or financial condition of Buyer or its subsidiaries, or in any of its
relationships with customers, employees, lessors or others, other than changes
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, none of
which individually or in the aggregate has had, or which would reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Except for the entry into this
Agreement and the issuance of the Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement
or as set forth on Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedules, no event,
liability or development has occurred or exists with respect to Buyer or its
subsidiaries or their respective business, properties, operations or
financial condition, that would be required to be disclosed by Buyer under
applicable securities laws at the time this representation is made that has
not been publicly disclosed at least one (1) trading day prior to the date
that this representation is made.

Section 5.12 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of Buyer consists
of (a) 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock, 7,287,636 of which are outstanding,
and (b) 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which
no shares of are issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding Common Stock
have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and are nonassessable,
and are not and were not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of applicable Law, the
organizational documents of Buyer, any Contract to which Buyer is or was a
party or otherwise bound, any Law or Governmental Order or any federal or
state securities or "blue sky" Laws. The issuance and sale of the Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement will not obligate Buyer to issue shares of
Common Stock or other securities to any Person (other than Seller) and will
not result in a right of any holder of Sellers securities to adjust
the exercise, conversion, exchange or reset price under any of such
securities. There are no stockholders agreements, voting agreements or other
similar agreements with respect to the Buyers capital stock to which Buyer is
a party or, to the knowledge of Buyer, between or among any of the Buyers
stockholders.

 



49 Section 5.13 _Access_. Buyer and its Representatives have been given full
access to the assets, books, records, Contracts and employees of the Seller,
and have been given the opportunity to meet with officers and other
Representatives of Seller for the purpose of investigating and obtaining
information regarding the Sellers Business and the Purchased Assets.

Section 5.14 _Transactions With Affiliates and Employees_. Except as set
forth in the Buyer Exchange Act Reports, none of the officers or directors of
Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, none of the employees of Buyer is
presently a party to any transaction with Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer
(other than for services as employees, officers and directors).

Section 5.15 _Insurance_. Buyer and its subsidiaries are insured by insurers
of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in
such amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which Buyer and
its subsidiaries are engaged, including, but not limited to, directors and
officers insurance coverage. Buyer has no reason to believe that it will not
be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage
expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may
be necessary to continue its business without a significant increase in cost.

Section 5.16 _Tax Status_. Except for matters that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect, Buyer and each subsidiary of Buyer has filed all necessary
federal, state and foreign income and franchise tax returns and has paid or
accrued all taxes shown as due thereon, and Buyer has no knowledge of a tax
deficiency which has been asserted or threatened against Buyer or any
subsidiary of Buyer.

 

Section 5.17 _Valid Issuance of Common Stock; Other Compliance Matters_. The
shares of Common Stock of Buyer issuable pursuant to this Agreement are duly
authorized and, when issued, sold and delivered in accordance with the terms
and for the consideration set forth in this Agreement, will be validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, free and clear of all Encumbrances imposed by
Buyer other than restrictions on transfer provided by applicable Law or by the
lockup set forth in Section 6.23. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
of Seller set forth in this Agreement, the Common Stock of Buyer will at all
times be issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities
laws. No registration under the Securities Act is required for the offer and
sale of the Common Stock by Buyer to Seller as contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyer has not, in the 12 months preceding the date hereof,
received notice from any trading market on which Buyers Common Stock is or
has been listed or quoted to the effect that Buyer is not in compliance with
the listing or maintenance requirements of such trading market. Buyer is in
compliance with all such listing and maintenance requirements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not violate
the marketplace rules of any such trading market.

 



50 Section 5.18 _Price_. Buyer has not, and to its knowledge, no Person has,
taken, directly or indirectly, any action primarily designed to cause or to
result in the stabilization or destabilization of the price of any security of
Buyer to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the Common Stock.

 

Section 5.19 _Information Supplied_. The information to be supplied by Buyer
expressly for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the materials
provided to Sellers shareholders will not, on the date such materials are
first mailed to Sellers shareholders and at the time of any meeting of
Sellers shareholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

 

Section 5.20 _Due Diligence_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has
made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon and on the
representations and warranties set forth in Article IV, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, Seller, the Business and the Purchased
Assets, (ii) has conducted such investigations of the Seller, the Business
and the Purchased Assets as Buyer deems necessary to satisfy itself as to the
operations and conditions thereof, and (iii) is relying (and will rely) solely
on such investigations and inquiries, and the express representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth in Article IV for all matters related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.21 _Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties made by Buyer in this Article V, neither Buyer nor any other
Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Buyer or its businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, or conditions
(financial or otherwise), and Buyer hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither
Seller nor any other Person has made or is making any express or implied
representation or warranty other than those contained in Article IV.

 

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS 

Section 6.01 _Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing_. From the date hereof
until the Closing, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or
consented to in writing by Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed), Seller shall (x) conduct the Business in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; and (y) use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve intact its current
Business organization, operations and franchise and to preserve the rights,
franchises, goodwill and relationships of its employees, customers, lenders,
suppliers, regulators and others having relationships with the Business.
Without limiting the foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Seller shall:

 

(a) preserve and maintain all Permits required for the conduct of the Business
as currently conducted or the ownership and use of the Purchased Assets;

 



51 (b) continue to collect Accounts Receivable in a manner consistent with past
practice, without discounting such Accounts Receivable;

financial, operating and other data and information related to the Business as
Buyer or any of its Representatives may reasonably request; and (c) instruct
the Representatives of Seller to reasonably cooperate with Buyer during normal

6.02 or any other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall be required to
provide to Buyer documents that are subject to a confidentiality agreement
that has not been duly waived and that relates to a party other than Seller,
and provided that all documents or other information subject to attorney-
client privilege and work-product doctrine shall be provided only under a
joint defense privilege, to the extent applicable, and Buyer and Seller shall
enter into such documentation as may reasonably be required to evidence such
joint privilege. Buyer agrees that it will not, and it will cause its
Representatives to not, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.02 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. That certain Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement,
dated February 21, 2018 by Buyer and Seller, shall apply with respect to
information furnished by Seller and its Representatives thereunder or
hereunder and any other activities contemplated thereby or hereby, until the
Closing and thereafter to the extent provided therein.

 



52 Section 6.03 _No Solicitation of Other Bids_.

 

(a) Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
or any of its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, any Person concerning a possible
Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other instruments
(whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates
and all of its and their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates)
relating to the direct or indirect disposition, whether by sale, merger or
otherwise, of all or any portion of the Business or the Purchased Assets.

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this Section 6.03, Seller shall
promptly (and in any event within three Business Days after receipt thereof
by Seller or its Representatives) advise Buyer orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the
identity of the Person making the same.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6.03, following the receipt
of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that
is or is reasonably expected to lead to a proposal that is superior to the
terms set forth in this Agreement ("Superior Proposal"), if Sellers Board of
Directors determines in good faith that a failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to cause Sellers Board of Directors to breach its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, Seller shall be permitted to engage in
discussions and negotiations with such bidder regarding the Acquisition
Proposal (including providing due diligence information to such bidder) and,
if Sellers Board of Directors determines in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, then Seller shall be permitted to either (i)
withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Buyer), or
propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Buyer), the Board of Directors adoption of the Agreement, (ii)
approve or recommend for approval, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend for approval, any Superior Proposal, (iii) postpone or adjourn any
shareholder meeting, (iv) resolve to take any of the foregoing actions, or (v)
terminate this Agreement and enter into a letter of intent and/or definitive
agreement and approve such Superior Proposal.

(d) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
Section 6.03 shall include having such provision specifically enforced by any
court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any
such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and
that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

 



53 Section 6.04 _Supplemental Information_.

 

(a) Seller may, from time to time prior to or at the Closing, by notice in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement any Disclosure
Schedule to add additional information or add a new Disclosure Schedule with a
corresponding reference to be added to this Agreement (each, a "Supplement"),
but not to correct any previously disclosed information. If Buyer does not
provide a written termination notice pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 9.01(e) within five (5) Business Days after receiving any Supplement
which discloses any event, fact or circumstance that has had, or
is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived for all purposes of this Agreement all rights and
remedies (including its right to not consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement due to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.02) hereunder or under applicable Law with regard to such event,
fact or circumstance.

 

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
in writing of:

 

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action known to Seller the existence,
occurrence or taking of which (A) has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (B) has
resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, any representation
or warranty made by Seller hereunder not being true and correct in
any material respect or (C) has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected
to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02
to be satisfied; provided, however, that Seller shall be permitted to cure, to
the extent susceptible to cure, any such matter referenced in this Section
6.04(b)(i) for a period not to exceed the lesser of thirty (30) days and June
30, 2018;

 

(ii) any written notice or other written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

(iv) any Actions commenced or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 4.16 or that relates to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Buyers receipt of information pursuant to the Section 6.04(b) shall not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Seller in this Agreement (including Section 8.02
and Section 9.01(b)) (except as provided in Section 8.08), and shall not be
deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules, except as specifically
provided in Section 6.04(a).

 



54 Section 6.05 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Commencing on the Closing Date, Seller shall terminate those employees
selected by Buyer and, at Buyers sole discretion, Buyer may retain any or
all of such employees on terms acceptable to Buyer and such employees.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 6.18, Seller shall be solely responsible,
and Buyer shall have no obligations whatsoever for, any compensation or other
amounts payable to any current or former employee, officer, director,
independent contractor or consultant of the Business, including,
without limitation, hourly pay, commission, bonus, salary, accrued vacation,
fringe, pension or profit sharing benefits or severance pay for any period
relating to the service with Seller at any time on or prior to the Closing
Date and Seller shall pay all such amounts to all entitled persons on or
prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Seller shall remain solely responsible for the satisfaction of all claims
for medical, dental, life insurance, health accident or disability benefits
brought by or in respect of current or former employees, officers, directors,
independent contractors or consultants of the Business or the spouses,
dependents or beneficiaries thereof, which claims relate to events occurring
on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller also shall remain solely responsible
for all workers compensation claims of any current or former employees,
officers, directors, independent contractors or consultants of the Business
which relate to events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all such amounts to the appropriate persons as and
when due.

 

Section 6.06 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, hold, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its or their respective Representatives to hold,
in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the
Business, except to the extent that Seller can show that such information (a)
is generally available to and known by the public through no fault of Seller,
any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully
acquired by Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives
from and after the Closing from sources which are not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation
known by Seller or its Affiliates. If Seller or any of its Affiliates or
their respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller
shall, to the extent legally permissible, promptly notify Buyer in writing and
shall disclose only that portion of such information which Seller is advised
by its counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed, provided that
Buyer may seek (at its sole cost and expense) an appropriate protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such information.

Section 6.07 _Stock Price_. At all times commencing on the date of this
Agreement until such time as the entire Earnout Payments have been satisfied
in full, Buyer shall not take, or permit any Affiliate or Representative, or
other Person on its behalf to take, directly or indirectly, any unlawful
action primarily designed to cause or to result in the stabilization or
destabilization of the price of Buyers Common Stock.

 



55 Section 6.08 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

(a) For a period of three years commencing on the Closing Date
(the "Restricted Period"), Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in or assist others in
engaging in the Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an
interest in any Person (other than Buyer) that engages directly or indirectly
in the Restricted Business in the Territory in any capacity, including as a
partner, shareholder, member, employee, principal, agent, trustee or
consultant; or (iii) cause, induce or encourage any material actual client,
customer, supplier or licensor of the Business (including any existing or
former client or customer of Seller and any Person that becomes a client or
customer of the Business after the Closing), or any other Person who has a
material business relationship with the Business, to terminate or modify any
such actual relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may own,
directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any
Person traded on any national securities exchange or automatic quotation
system if Seller is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which
controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of
any class of securities of such Person; provided, however, that such
ownership limitation shall not apply to Sellers (or any of its shareholders)
ownership of any Common Stock of Buyer.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any Person who
is employed by Buyer or its Affiliates or any Person who is offered employment
by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.05(a) or is or was employed in the Business
during the Restricted Period, or encourage any such employee to leave
such employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment,
except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically
to any such employees; provided, that nothing in this Section 6.07(b) shall
prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose
employment has been terminated by Buyer or (ii) after 90 days from the date of
termination of employment, any employee whose employment has been terminated
by the employee.

 

(c) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
6.07 may give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages
may not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a breach
or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer may, in
addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it
in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a
temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other
relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without
any requirement to post bond).

(d) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 6.07
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and
constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 6.07 should ever be

 



56  adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be
deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product
or service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this Section 6.07 and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 6.09 _Governmental Approvals and Consents_. Each party hereto shall,
as promptly as possible, (i) make, or cause or be made, all filings and
submissions required under any Law applicable to such party or any of its
Affiliates; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause
to be obtained, all consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all
Governmental Authorities necessary for its execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other
party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties hereto shall not willfully
take any action outside of such partys ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice that will have the effect of delaying, impairing
or impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals.

 

Section 6.10 _Books and Records_.

 

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Seller prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose,

periods prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with the prior

relate to the Business and its operations for periods prior to the Closing;

normal business hours, to such books and records.

(c) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to provide the other party
with access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant to
this Section 6.09 where such access would violate any Law.

Law or stock exchange requirements (based upon the reasonable advice of
counsel), no party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in

other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such
announcement.

(a) From and after the Closing, if Seller or any of its Affiliates receives or

Asset, Seller or its Affiliate shall remit such funds to Buyer within ten (10)

to any Accounts Receivable included in the Purchased Assets that is made
payable to Seller, Buyer is hereby authorized by Seller to endorse and deposit
such payment for its own account.

(b) From and after the Closing, if Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives or

deposit such payment for its own account.

 



58 Section 6.15 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents shall be borne and paid by Seller when due. Seller shall,
at its own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other document with respect
to such Taxes or fees (and Buyer shall cooperate with respect thereto as

Section 6.16 _Certain Payments_. Within fourteen (14) days after the Closing,
Seller shall pay all obligations due and owing to Duke, BioArchive and its
Scientific Advisory Board, including Joanne Kurtzberg, and provide reasonable
proof thereof to Buyer. To the extent any of the aforementioned payments set
forth in this Section 6.16 are not paid or released within such fourteen (14)
day period, then Buyer shall be entitled to exercise its set-off rights
against any such payments in accordance with Section 8.06(b).

 

Section 6.17 _Name Change in Corporate Name_. Within five (5) Business Days
after Closing, Seller will change its corporate name to a name that does not
contain, and will not likely be confused with, its existing name, or any
derivative thereof, and shall thereafter cease using its existing name.

 

Section 6.18 _Transition of Business_. At Buyers expense, Seller shall, for a
period of up to 90 days, cooperate with Buyer in the orderly transition of

(located at 1991 Summit Park Drive, Suite 2000, Orlando FL 32810) on a month-
to-month basis for up to 90 days so that Buyer can operate and transition the
Business. Furthermore, during the period of time that Buyer elects to so
access the foregoing premises, which may be up to 90 days but could be less,
in its discretion (Buyer will notify Seller of the period of time Buyer
desires access to such Leased Property on or before the close of business
on May 28, 2018), Buyer shall pay, and be responsible for, all rent, at a
total rent price of $18,323 per month, pro rated for any partial months, plus
all related property and sales taxes, utility costs and other facility
expenses for the period during which Buyer is accessing the Leased Real
Property and shall directly pay such rent to any applicable landlord under any
such Lease or reimburse Seller, at Sellers written direction, and with
respect to all related property and sales taxes, utility costs and other
facility expenses for Leased Real Property, as reasonably directed in writing
by Seller. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any compensation paid or
payable to any employee of Seller after the Closing Date and during the
90-day transition period set forth in this Section 6.18 that assist in such
transition; provided that, on or before the close of business

 



59  on May 28, 2018, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of proposed
employees reasonably necessary to provide assistance during the transition
period at Buyers expense, which list of employees shall be subject to
Buyers prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 6.19 _Prepaid Fees_. Within twenty (20) days of the Closing, Seller
shall pay and deliver to Buyer the Prepaid Fees in immediately available
funds to an account designated by Buyer, along with a written calculation of
all such Prepaid fees specifying the amount, nature and timing of the Prepaid
Fees. Buyer shall have thirty (30) days from the date it receives the
foregoing payment and documentation from Seller to inspect the books and
records of Seller reasonably necessary to confirm the amount of the Prepaid
Fees and Seller shall provide Buyer and its representatives with such access
during regular business hours and upon reasonable notice. If Buyer objects in
writing to the calculation of the Prepaid Fees by providing Seller with a
dispute notice within such thirty-day period and Buyer and Seller cannot
resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after the date Buyer delivers its
dispute notice to Seller, such dispute shall be resolved by an
independent accountant mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller. The fees and
expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer.

 

Section 6.20 _Allocation of Property Taxes_. All state, county and local ad
valorem Taxes on real or personal property ("Property Taxes") shall be
prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Closing Date, computed by
multiplying the amount of Property Taxes for the fiscal year for which the
same are levied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in such fiscal year up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such fiscal year. Seller shall be
responsible for the portion of such Property Taxes related to the period
prior to Closing and Buyer shall be responsible for the portion of such
Property Taxes related to the period after Closing. If Buyer pays the entire
Property Taxes when due, Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for its portion
of such Taxes.

Section 6.21 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and
deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and
take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the
provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

Section 6.22 ___Matters Relating to the Shares_.

(a) The Shares to be issued to Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall not
have been registered and shall be characterized as "restricted securities"
under applicable federal and state securities laws, and under such laws such
shares may be resold without registration under the Securities Act and state
securities laws, only in certain limited circumstances. Each certificate or

 



60  book-entry allocation evidencing the Shares to be issued to Seller under
this Agreement shall bear an appropriate restrictive legend or stop transfer
instructions with respect thereto in substantially the following form:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS INSTRUMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND
MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED, SOLD, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF EXCEPT
WHILE A REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATING THERETO IS IN EFFECT UNDER SUCH ACT
AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS.

(b) Buyer hereby agrees to remove the restrictive legend set forth on
the certificates representing the Shares and issue a certificate without such
restrictive legend to the holder of the applicable certificate upon which it
is stamped or issue to such holder by electronic delivery at the applicable
balance account at the Depository Trust Company at such time as (i) such
Shares are registered for resale under the Securities Act, (ii) such Shares
are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144, and (iii) such Shares are
eligible for sale under Rule 144, without the requirement for Buyer to be in
compliance with the current public information required under Rule 144 as to
such securities and without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions. Following
the earlier of subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) of this Section 6.22(b), upon
the written request of the Seller, Buyer shall instruct its transfer agent to
remove the restrictive legend from the Shares and shall cause its counsel to
issue any legend removal opinion required by the transfer agent. In connection
with a sale of Shares in reliance on Rule 144, Seller or its broker shall
also deliver to Buyer a customary broker representation letter, which shall
include, as may be appropriate, a certification that Seller is not an
affiliate of Buyer (as defined in Rule 144) and a certification as to the
length of time the applicable Shares have been held.

(c) Buyer shall file on a timely basis (or obtain extensions in respect
thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to
be filed by it under the Exchange Act. If Buyer is not required to file
reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, upon the request of Seller or any of its
shareholders, Buyer shall make publicly available the information specified
in subparagraph (c)(2) of SEC Rule 144 for a period not to exceed three (3)
years from the date Buyer is no longer required to file reports pursuant to
the Exchange Act. Buyer shall take such further action as may be reasonably
required from time to time and as may be within the reasonable control of
Buyer, to enable Seller or its shareholders, as applicable, to transfer the
Shares without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by SEC Rule 144 or any similar rule or regulation
hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of Seller or any of its
shareholders, as applicable, Buyer will deliver to Seller or such shareholder,
as applicable a written statement as to whether it has complied with such
requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof. In connection with the sale,
transfer or disposition of any of the Shares under SEC Rule 144, provided that
Seller or its broker shall have delivered to Buyer a customary representation
letter, Buyer agrees promptly to cause its transfer agent to remove the
restrictive legend on certificates or book entries representing the Shares
sold, 

 



61  transferred or distributed to the transferees and if necessary to instruct
Buyers counsel to promptly issue an opinion, at Buyers expense, confirming
to the transfer agent the right to have such legend removed. In connection
with any sale, transfer or other disposition by Seller or any of its
shareholders, as applicable, pursuant to SEC Rule 144, Buyer shall cooperate
with such holder to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates representing such Shares to be sold and not bearing any
Securities Act legend, and enable certificates for such Shares to be for such
number of shares and registered in such names as Seller or any shareholder, as
applicable, may reasonably request.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6.22, Seller may transfer
the Shares to its shareholders after the six (6) month anniversary of the
Closing Date in compliance with applicable Law, provided that each such
shareholders first executes and delivers to Buyer an agreement to comply with
the right of first refusal as set forth in Section 6.23. Any transfer or
attempted transfer of any of the Shares in violation of this Section 6.22(d)
or Section 6.23 shall be null and void, no such transfer shall be recorded on
Buyers books and the purported transferee in any such transfer shall not be
treated (and the purported transferor shall continue be treated) as the owner
of such Shares for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.23 _Right of First Refusal_.

 

(a) Until the date which is five (5) years from the Closing Date (the "ROFR
Term"), in the event Seller ever elects to sell Shares to a third party in a
sale involving a number of Shares equal to or greater than 5,000 Shares (a
"Block Trade"), then Seller shall provide Buyer with a right of first refusal
to purchase all of the Shares proposed to be sold pursuant to the Block Trade
on the terms and conditions specified in this Section 6.23. If Seller proposes
to effectuate a Block Trade, Seller shall deliver a written transfer notice to
Buyer stating the number of Shares it proposes to sell pursuant to the Block
Trade (the "Offer"). Buyer may accept the Offer at any time within three (3)
Business Days of the date of its receipt of the Offer (the "Acceptance
Period") by providing Seller with a written notice of acceptance (the
"Acceptance"). Upon providing the Acceptance, Buyer shall, to the extent
legally required, promptly instruct Buyers counsel to promptly issue an
opinion, at Buyers expense, confirming to the transfer agent the right to
have any restrictive legend removed.

(b) The closing of the sale of the Shares subject to the Offer will take
place within ten (10) Business Days of the date of the Acceptance, and the
entire purchase price for such Shares shall be the average of the closing sale
prices of Common Stock as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board during the
five (5) consecutive full trading days ending at the closing of trading on
the trading day immediately prior to the date of the receipt of the Offer.
Buyer shall pay the entire purchase price for such Shares in immediately
available funds at such closing. At such closing, the parties will enter into
a letter agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I.

(c) If Buyer does not timely deliver the Acceptance within the Acceptance
Period or affirmatively rejects the Offer, then Seller shall be permitted to
sell the Shares identified in the Offer without restriction, except as
provided by applicable Law; provided that if Seller does not so sell all of
such shares within 120 days of the expiration of the Acceptance Period, then
the

 



62  provisions of this Section 6.23 shall again apply to such shares. If Buyer
fails on more than three occasions to close on the purchase of the Shares
pursuant to the Offer after it has delivered Seller an Acceptance then the
right of first refusal described in this Section 6.23 shall automatically,
without any action required by any party, expire and shall thereafter be of no
further force or effect.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of first refusal described in
this Section 6.23 shall not apply to any dividend or distribution by Seller
of any Shares to its shareholders; provided, however, that each shareholder
receiving any Shares pursuant to any such dividend or distribution made during
the ROFR Term agrees to enter into a right of first refusal agreement with
the same terms and conditions as set forth in this Section 6.23.

(e) During the period commencing upon the delivery of the Offer and ending on
the later of: (1) forty-eight (48) hours after the expiration of the
Acceptance Period or rejection of the Offer, as applicable; and (2) the
closing of the purchase of the Shares by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.23,
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its officers and directors to not, buy or
sell any shares of Common Stock beneficially owned (as determined by Rule
13d-3 of the Exchange Act) by Buyer, or any officer or director of Buyer.

Section 6.24 _FDA Registration_. Buyer shall: (a) file an application and/or
registration with each appropriate Governmental Authority, including without
limitation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within seven (7) Business Days
after the Closing Date to obtain all approvals reasonably necessary for Buyer
to serve as a public cord blood bank and actively engage in the public cord
blood business (including the ability to sell any of the Public Cord Blood
Inventory) in at least the same manner as conducted by Seller (collectively,
the "Cord Blood Approvals"); and (b) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain and maintain all of the Cord Blood Approvals.

Section 8.04 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in
Section 8.02 and Section 8.03 shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.02(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under Section 8.02(a) exceeds $120,000 (the "Basket"), in
which event Seller shall be required to pay or be liable for all such
Losses from the first dollar. With respect to any claim as to which the
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.02(a) or
Section 8.03(a), as the case may be, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any individual or series of related Losses which do not exceed
$5,000 (which Losses shall not be counted toward the Basket). The aggregate
amount of all Losses for which Seller shall be liable pursuant to Section
8.02(a) shall not exceed $1,500,000 (the "Cap").

 



67 (b) Buyer shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for indemnification
under Section 8.03(a) until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under Section 8.03(a) exceeds the Basket, in which event Buyer
shall be required to pay or be liable for all such Losses from the first
dollar. The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer shall be liable
pursuant to Section 8.03(a) shall not exceed the Cap.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Section
8.04(a) and Section 8.04(b) shall not apply to Losses based upon, arising out
of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty in Section 4.01, Section 4.02, Section 4.08,
Section 4.22, Section 5.01, Section 5.02 and Section 5.04. The aggregate
amount of all Losses for which Seller shall be liable pursuant to Section
8.02(b) and (c) and for which Buyer shall be liable pursuant to Section
8.03(b) and (c) shall not exceed the Purchase Price actually received;
provided, however, that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to any
claims by Seller related to any Earnout Payments.

(d) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03
in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received or entitled to be
received by the Indemnified Party in respect of any such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover
under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement. 

(e) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.02 or Section 8.03
in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any Tax benefit
realized as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party.

(f) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including incurring costs only to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the
breach that gives rise to such Loss.

(g) For purposes of this Article VIII, any Losses resulting from any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty (other than those set forth in
(a) the definition of Material Contract and Permitted Exceptions, (b) any
provisions of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement that require the Company to list items in the Schedules, and (c)
the representations set forth in Section 4.01, Section 4.06(a), Section 4.08,
Section 5.01, and Section 5.11).

 

(h) In no event shall any Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees be entitled
to seek or receive indemnification for the same Loss more than once under
this Article VIII even if a claim for indemnification in respect of such Loss
has been made as a result of a breach of more than one (1) representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

 



68 Section 8.05 _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim under
this Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to
as the "Indemnifying Party."

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of such
Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure or is otherwise materially prejudiced
thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, such
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of
any such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it
shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that
if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (A) there
are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there
exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third
Party Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement, or fails to diligently
prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to Section 8.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and
seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of Section
6.06) records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the
defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party
Claim.

 



69 (b) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this Section 8.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such
offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third
Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third
Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to
Section 8.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a
Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than 30 days after
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure or
is otherwise materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified
Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30
days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such information and
assistance (including access to the Indemnified Partys premises and personnel
and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



70 Section 8.06 _Payments; Setoff_.

 

(a) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within 15 Business Days of such final, non-appealable
adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The parties
hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any
such obligations within such 15 Business Day period, any amount payable shall
accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the Indemnifying
Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to and including the date such
payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to six percent (6%). Such
interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and
the actual number of days elapsed.

(b) Buyer may set off any sums owed to it by Seller as a result of Section
8.02 against any sums (including the Cash Holdback) or Common Stock
(including the Stock Holdback) it owes to Seller, including any Earnout
Payment. If Buyer exercises this right of set-off described in this Section
8.06(b), then Buyer shall deposit amounts otherwise due to Seller, as and
when due, with Escrow Agent to be held in an interest bearing escrow account
until the earliest of the date that (x) Buyer and Seller mutually agree how to
disburse the amounts deposited in escrow, (y) the matter is resolved in the
manner set forth Section 8.05, or (z) a final determination regarding the
validity of any indemnification claim has been made by a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided, however, that the prevailing party in any such
dispute described in this Section 8.06(b) shall also receive interest on any
amounts deposited in escrow, payable by the non-prevailing party at a rate
equal to six percent (6%) (with a credit for interest previously earned in
the interest bearing escrow account) calculated on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over 365, from the date any such amounts are deposited
in escrow to the date such amounts are distributed to the prevailing party.
Any amounts set off against any Common Stock shall be based on the Buyer
Average Stock Price during the thirty (30) consecutive full trading days
ending at the closing of trading on the trading day immediately prior to the
date that Buyer notified Seller of the Third Party Claim or Direct Claim, as
applicable.

 

Section 8.07 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 

Section 8.08 _Effect of Investigation_. Seller shall not be liable under this
Article VIII for any Losses based upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations or warranties of Seller contained in this
Agreement if David Portnoy or Mark Portnoy had actual (not constructive)
knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the Closing. Buyer shall not
be liable under this Article VIII for any Losses based upon or arising out of
any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement if Seller had actual Knowledge of such
inaccuracy or breach prior to the Closing.

 



71 Section 8.09 ___Exclusive Remedies ___. Subject to Section 6.08 and Section
10.11, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud,
criminal activity or willful misconduct) for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set
forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it
may have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of
their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII.
Nothing in this Section 8.09 shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain
any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any
remedy on account of any partys intentionally fraudulent, criminal or
intentional misconduct.

the parties under this Agreement.

 



77 Section 10.12 _Disclosure Generally_. All schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement, including
all schedules. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Disclosure Schedules or in this Agreement, the information and disclosures
contained in any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and
incorporated by reference in any other Disclosure Schedule or representation
or warranty contained in Article IV or Article V, as applicable, as though
fully set forth in such Disclosure Schedule or representation or warranty,
provided that the disclosing party has acted in good faith by attempting to
provide cross-references where applicable and, in the absence of any such
cross references, the applicability of the information to such other sections
of these Disclosure Schedules is readily apparent on the face of
such disclosure that a reasonable person would conclude that it applies to
such other section, notwithstanding the absence of a cross reference contained
therein. The specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules or exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are
not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are

of the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion

dispute or controversy between the parties hereto as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this Agreement,

Schedules and exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this
Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to
be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including any violation of Law or breach of contract). Nothing in

representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or create any covenant.
Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used

Section 10.13 _Non-Recourse_. Except with respect to claims arising from
fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct, all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the other
Ancillary Documents

 



78  (including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents), may be made only against
the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and thereto. No
Person who is not a named party to this Agreement or the other Ancillary
Documents, including any Non-Recourse Party of any named party to this

seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or such other Ancillary Document (as the
case may be) or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or such other Ancillary Document (as the case may be) or the
negotiation or execution hereof or thereof; and each party hereto waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-
Recourse Party, other than, in each case, for claims arising from fraud,
criminal activity or willful misconduct. Each Non-Recourse Party is expressly
intended as third-party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.
