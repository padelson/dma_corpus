8

    

 Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity, and each Certificate relating

(e) The numbers of shares of Parent Class A Stock that the Company

share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment therefor; and (b)
each membership interest in Second Merger Sub issued and outstanding

become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable membership interest
in the Surviving Entity, which shall constitute the only outstanding equity of
the Surviving Entity. From and after the Second Effective Time, all
certificates, if any, representing membership interests in Second Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of membership
interests of the Surviving Entity into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence. 

2.9 _Surrender of Company Certificates and Disbursement of Estimated Merger
Consideration_ _and Earn Out Shares_.

 

(a) Subject to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, at the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each Company Stockholder such Company
Stockholders portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Earn Out
Shares as set forth on the Final Spreadsheet.

 

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts, following and subject to
receipt of the relevant Company Stockholder information and addresses from
the Company, to within ten (10) days prior to the Closing deliver (or cause to
be delivered) to each Company Stockholder (other than holders of Excluded
Shares) at the address specified by the Company: (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or Affidavits of Loss) to Parent, such letter of transmittal to
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree; and (ii) instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or
Affidavits of Loss) to Parent (the " _Surrender Documentation_ "). If a
Company Stockholder surrenders a Certificate (or Affidavit of Loss) and all
other required Surrender Documentation to Parent in accordance with the terms
of the Surrender Documentation no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Parent will use commercially reasonably efforts to deliver
(or cause to be delivered) at the Closing to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate (or Affidavit of Loss) in exchange therefor such holders portion
of the Estimated Merger Consideration and Earn Out Shares in accordance with

 



10

    

  _Section_ __ _ 2.9(a)_ hereof, with: (A) such Company Stockholders
portion of the Minimum Closing Cash Consideration and Remaining Closing Cash
Consideration being delivered via wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with instructions provided by such Company Stockholder in
the letter of transmittal; and (B) the applicable number of shares from the
Closing Number of Securities and Earn Out Shares (as applicable) being
delivered via book-entry issuance, in each case, _less_ any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.13_. If a Company Stockholder
does not deliver to Parent the required Surrender Documentation in accordance
with the terms of the Surrender Documentation with respect to such Company
Stockholders Certificates together with such Certificates (or Affidavits of
Loss) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then upon
surrender thereafter of such Company Stockholders Certificates (or Affidavits
of Loss) to Parent in accordance with the terms of the Surrender
Documentation, Parent shall promptly deliver (or cause to be delivered) to
the Company Stockholder that is the holder of such Certificate(s) (or
Affidavit(s) of Loss) in exchange therefor such Company Stockholders portion
of the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Earn Out Shares (if
applicable) covered by such Surrender Documentation in accordance with
clauses (A) and (B) of the foregoing sentence. Any Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate (or
Affidavit of Loss) shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Total Consideration
attributable to such Certificate (or Affidavit of Loss), and the holder
thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate (or Affidavit of Loss) except as otherwise provided herein or by
any Legal Requirements. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or Affidavits of Loss). In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable portion of
the Total Consideration to be delivered upon due surrender of the Certificate
(or Affidavit of Loss) may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate (or
Affidavit of Loss) formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to Parent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock Transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate (or Affidavit of Loss) is presented to the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or Parent for transfer, it shall
be cancelled and deemed exchanged for (without interest and after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.13_)
the portion of the Total Consideration represented by such Certificate (or
Affidavit of Loss). 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Entity, Parent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
Company Stockholder for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal
Requirements.

 



11

    

(e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed:
(i) upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed (an " _Affidavit of Loss_ "); and
(ii) if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate, Parent
will issue the portion of the Total Consideration attributable to such
Certificate (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 2.13_).

 

2.10 _Adjustment Escrow Deposit_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with
the Escrow Agent an amount equal to $2,000,000 in cash (the " _Adjustment
Escrow Amount_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S.
dollars into a designated non-interest bearing account (the " _Adjustment
Escrow Account_ "). Pursuant to an escrow agreement to be entered into on the
Closing Date by and among Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the
Escrow Agent in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the parties
thereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), Parent and the Stockholder
Representative will appoint the Escrow Agent to hold the Adjustment Escrow
Amount until the final determination of the Final Merger Consideration and
disburse the Adjustment Escrow Amount as provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement.

delivery of the Company Estimated Adjustment Statement and any relevant books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall reasonably assist Parent and its Representatives in its
review of such documentation and shall consider in good faith Parents
comments to the Company Estimated Adjustment Statement, and if any
adjustments are made to the Company Estimated Adjustment Statement prior to
the Closing, such adjusted Company Estimated Adjustment Statement shall
thereafter become the Company Estimated Adjustment Statement for all purposes
of this Agreement; _provided_ that Parent shall provide any such comments to
the Company no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _further_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that, following the
Companys consideration in good faith of Parents comments to the Company

12

    

 Statement, the Company may determine, in its sole and absolute discretion,
not to make any adjustments to the Company Estimated Adjustment Statement, in
which case the Company Estimated Adjustment Statement shall be the Company
Estimated Adjustment Statement delivered by the Company to Parent. In no event
will the determination of the amounts set forth in the Company Estimated
Adjustment Statement, whether mutually agreed to or the subject of a
disagreement, prejudice the rights of Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.11_. The Company Estimated Adjustment Statement and the determinations
contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with the applicable
definitions contained in this Agreement.

(b) No later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent
shall deliver to the Company a statement (the " _Parent Estimated Adjustment
Statement_ ") setting forth Parents good faith estimate of (i) the Parent

reasonable supporting documentation used by Parent in calculating such
amounts, including all invoices or similar documentation accounting for such

and its Representatives shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and

connection with the delivery of the Parent Estimated Adjustment Statement and
any relevant books and records of Parent. Parent shall reasonably assist the
Company and its Representatives in its review of such documentation and shall
consider in good faith the Companys comments to the Parent Estimated

Adjustment Statement shall be the Parent Estimated Adjustment Statement
delivered by Parent to the Company. In no event will the determination of the
amounts set forth in the Parent Estimated Adjustment Statement, whether
mutually agreed to or the subject of a disagreement, prejudice the rights of
the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_. The Parent Estimated
Adjustment Statement and the determinations contained therein shall be
prepared in accordance with the applicable definitions contained in this
Agreement.

 



13

    

(c) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver a draft of the Final Spreadsheet to Parent based upon the
amounts contained in the Company Estimated Adjustment Statement and the Parent
Estimated Adjustment Statement, and shall provide to Parent any such documents
as Parent may reasonably request evidencing the amounts set forth on the
Final Spreadsheet. Other than as may be agreed to by Parent in writing, the
Final Spreadsheet shall be prepared in accordance with, and shall not deviate
in any material respect from, the principles, percentages and allocations set
forth in the Initial Spreadsheet. The Company shall reasonably consider any
comments timely provided by Parent to the Final Spreadsheet.

 

(d) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Stockholder Representative an
unaudited statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ "), which shall set forth
Parents good faith calculation of each of:

 

(i) Company Cash;

 

(ii) the Closing Indebtedness Amount;

 

(iii) the Trust Account Interest; and

 

(iv) the Closing Transaction Costs (including a detailed breakdown of the
Company Transaction Costs and the Parent Transaction Costs).

To the extent any amounts in the calculation of the foregoing are not U.S.

exchange rate to U.S. dollars for the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg
L.P.

(e) Upon receipt from Parent, the Stockholder Representative shall have
thirty (30) days to review the Adjustment Statement (the " _Adjustment Review
Period_ "). At the request of the Stockholder Representative, Parent shall:
(i) reasonably cooperate and assist, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Entity, and each of their respective Representatives
to reasonably cooperate and assist, the Stockholder Representative and its
Representatives in the review of the Adjustment Statement (including by
requesting their respective accountants to deliver to the Stockholder
Representative and its Representatives copies of their work papers relating to
the Surviving Entity; _provided_ that customary confidentiality and hold
harmless agreements relating to access such working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to any auditors or independent accountants are
signed by the Stockholders Representative and its Representatives, as
applicable); and (ii) provide the Stockholder Representative and its
Representatives with any information reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representative that is necessary for their review of the Adjustment Statement.
If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with Parents computation of the
Closing Transaction Costs, Company Cash, the Closing Indebtedness Amount or
the Trust Account Interest (each as set forth in the Adjustment Statement),
the Stockholder Representative shall, on or prior to the last day of the
Adjustment Review Period, deliver a written notice to Parent (the "
_Adjustment Notice of Objection_ ") that sets forth the Stockholder
Representatives objections to Parents calculation of the Closing
Transaction Costs, Company Cash, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, and the
Trust Account Interest, as applicable. Any Adjustment Notice of Objection
shall specify those items or amounts with which the Stockholder Representative
disagrees and shall set forth the Stockholder Representatives calculation of
the Closing Transaction Costs (including a detailed breakdown of the Company
Transaction Costs and the

 



14

    

 Parent Transaction Costs to the extent these differ from Parents
calculation thereof), Company Cash, the Closing Indebtedness Amount or the
Trust Account Interest, as applicable, based on such objections (it being
understood that the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted Parents calculation of any amounts set forth on the Adjustment
Statement to which the Stockholder Representative does not object in
the Adjustment Notice of Objection).

(f) If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver an Adjustment Notice of
Objection to Parent with respect to an item contained in the Adjustment
Statement within the Adjustment Review Period, the Stockholder Representative
shall be deemed to have accepted Parents calculation of the underlying item
of the Closing Transaction Costs, Company Cash, the Closing Indebtedness
Amount, and the Trust Account Interest, as applicable, and such calculation
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Stockholder
Representative delivers an Adjustment Notice of Objection to Parent within
the Adjustment Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall,
during the thirty (30) days following such delivery or any mutually agreed
extension thereof, use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of the disputed
Closing Transaction Costs (along with the amount of the Company Transaction
Costs and the Parent Transaction Costs included therein), Company Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness Amount or the Trust Account Interest, as applicable. If,
at the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, Parent and
the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve their disagreements, they
shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (such firm or individual, the " _Independent Expert_ "), who
shall act as an independent accounting expert and not as an arbiter. The
Parties shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly to review this
_Section_ __ _ 2.11_, as well as the Adjustment Statement, Adjustment Notice
of Objection and any other materials reasonably requested by the Independent
Expert, and to determine, solely with respect to the disputed items and
amounts so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing
Transaction Costs (along with the amount of the Company Transaction Costs
and the Parent Transaction Costs included therein), Company Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness Amount or the Trust Account Interest, as applicable, set forth in
the Adjustment Statement requires adjustment pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The Independent Expert shall base its determination solely on
written submissions by Parent and the Stockholder Representative and not on an
independent review. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall make
available to the Independent Expert all relevant books and records and other
items reasonably requested by the Independent Expert. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after its retention,
the Independent Expert shall deliver to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative a report that sets forth its resolution of the disputed items
and amounts and its calculation of the Closing Transaction Costs (including
its detailed breakdown of the Company Transaction Costs and the Parent
Transaction Costs), Company Cash, the Closing Indebtedness Amount or the
Trust Account Interest, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Independent Expert may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by Parent, on one hand, and the
Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, nor less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by Parent, on one hand, and the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand. The decision of the Independent Expert
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The costs and expenses
of the Independent Expert shall be allocated between Parent, on the one hand,
and the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company
Stockholders), on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion
of the aggregate contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the
aggregate amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by the
Independent Expert.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Company Cash_ ", "
_Final Closing Indebtedness Amount_ ", " _Final Trust Account Interest_ " and
" _Final Closing Transaction Costs_ " mean the amount of such items: (i) as
shown in the Adjustment Statement delivered by Parent to the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11(d)_ if no Adjustment Notice of
Objection with respect thereto is timely delivered by the Stockholder
Representative to Parent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.11(f)_; or (ii) if an
Adjustment Notice of Objection is so delivered: (A) as agreed by Parent and
the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11(f)_; or (B) in
the absence of such agreement, as determined in the Independent Experts
report delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.11(f)_.

 

(h) Within five (5) Business Days after the Final Merger Consideration has
been finally determined pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.11_:

(i) if the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Merger Consideration, Parent shall be entitled to receive a payment in cash
out of the Adjustment Escrow Account in an amount equal to such difference;
_provided_ that if such amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount: (A)
Parent shall be entitled to receive the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount; and
(B) each Company Stockholder shall severally, but not jointly, pay to Parent
an aggregate amount equal to such Company Stockholders Contribution
Percentage Obligation (allocated to such Company Stockholder in the Final
Spreadsheet) of the amount of such difference, at the election of each Company
Stockholder either in cash or by transfer of shares of Parent Class A Stock,
with a share of Parent Class A Stock valued at $10 per share for such purpose
( _provided_ that each Company Stockholder shall not be permitted to make any
payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.11(h)(i)_ by transfer of shares of
Parent Class A Stock if the Stockholder Representative determines, in its
sole discretion, that transferring such shares could jeopardize the
qualification of the Mergers, taken together, as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code);  _provided_ , _further_ , that if
such amount is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then any amount left in
the Adjustment Escrow Account after payment to Parent shall be distributed to
the Company Stockholders on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the
percentage of the Adjustment Escrow Amount allocated to such Company
Stockholder in the Final Spreadsheet);

 

(ii) if the Final Merger Consideration is equal to the Estimated Merger
Consideration, each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive its
share of the Adjustment Escrow Amount in cash in accordance with the
percentage of the Adjustment Escrow Amount allocated to such Company
Stockholder in the Final Spreadsheet; and

 



16

    

(iii) if the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Merger Consideration, each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
its share of the Adjustment Escrow Amount in cash in accordance with the
percentage of the Adjustment Escrow Amount allocated to such Company
Stockholder in the Final Spreadsheet; _provided_ that if such amount exceeds
the Adjustment Escrow Amount, at the election of Parent (subject to _Section_
__ _ 2.11(l)_), Parent shall either issue additional shares of Parent Class A
Stock valued at $10 per share for such purpose or the Surviving Entity shall
pay to each Company Stockholder an amount in cash equal to such Company
Stockholders pro rata share (in accordance with the percentage of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount allocated to such Company Stockholder in the Final
Spreadsheet) of the amount of such difference.

(i) Any cash payment required to be made by: (i) the Company Stockholders
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account of the Surviving
Entity designated in writing by Parent at least one (1) Business Day prior to
such transfer; and (ii) the Surviving Entity on behalf of Parent pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. dollars in accordance with instructions provided by
such Company Stockholder in the letter of transmittal (which instructions may
be updated in writing by the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Stockholders) at least one (1) Business Day prior to such transfer).

(j) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_ shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Total Consideration by the Parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Applicable Legal Requirements.

(k) No fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock will be issued by virtue
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.11_, and each Company Stockholder who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock that otherwise
would be received by such Company Stockholder) shall receive from Parent, in
lieu of such fractional share: (i) one share of Parent Class A Stock if the
aggregate amount of fractional shares of Parent Class A Stock such Company
Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to is equal to or exceeds 0.50; or
(ii) no shares of Parent Class A Stock if the aggregate amount of fractional
shares of Parent Class A Stock such Company Stockholder would otherwise be
entitled to is less than 0.50.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that sum of the cash payable under this Agreement to Company Stockholders in
respect of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (and for the sake
of clarity not including any payments made in respect of Company RSUs),
including the Closing Cash Payment Amount (as the same may be adjusted as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.11(l)_), the Adjustment Escrow Amount, the
Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount and any
other consideration (other than Parent Class A Stock or the Earn Out Shares),
determined at the Closing (the " _Non-Stock Consideration_"), would cause
the Non-Stock Consideration to exceed sixty percent (60%) of an amount equal
to: (i) the product of: (A) the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock to be
issued to the Company Stockholders at Closing in respect of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock (as the same may be adjusted as provided in
this _Section_ __ _ 2.11(l)_); _multiplied by_ (B) the Testing Price; _plus_
(ii) the Non-Stock Consideration (the sum of clauses (i) and (ii), the
"Aggregate Consideration"), then: (1) the number of shares of Parent Class A
Stock required to be issued to the Company Stockholders in respect of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock as of the Closing shall be increased;
and (2) the Closing Cash Payment Amount payable in respect of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall be decreased by an amount equal to
the Adjustment Per Share Price _multiplied by_ each share of Parent Class A
Stock issued

 



17

    

 pursuant to clause (1), until the Non-Stock Consideration is equal (rounding
up to the next whole share of Parent Class A Stock) to sixty percent (60%) of
the Aggregate Consideration. If any Non-Stock Consideration is payable after
the Closing Date, the total Non-Stock Consideration as a percentage of
the Aggregate Consideration shall be retested, and if such percentage would
exceed sixty percent (60%), Non-Stock Consideration shall be reduced, and in
lieu thereof additional shares of Parent Class A Stock shall be issued, in
each case based on the principles set forth in preceding sentence (it being
understood that Parent Class A Stock theretofore issued, including any Parent
Class A Stock issued theretofore on conversion of the Earn Out Shares, shall
be valued using the Testing Price applicable to such issuance). Any shares
issued pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.11(l)_ shall be equitably adjusted
for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations,
recapitalizations, reclassifications, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change or transaction with respect to Parent Class A Stock occurring
after the date hereof.

 

2.12 _Tax Treatment of the Mergers_.

 

(a) The Parties shall not take or cause to be taken any action, or fail to
take or cause to be taken any action, which action or failure to act would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers, taken together, from
constituting an integrated transaction described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2
C.B. 321 that qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations.

(b) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
Parties shall prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment
of the Mergers, taken together, as an integrated transaction described in
Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 that qualifies as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations (or
comparable provisions of state and local Tax law) and shall not take any
inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise
required by a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

2.13 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity and their Affiliates shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, any amount required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under Applicable Legal
Requirements; provided, that if Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates determine that any payment to the
Company Stockholders hereunder is subject to deduction and/or withholding,
then (a) Parent shall provide notice to the Company (for payments made at the
Closing) or the Stockholder Representative (for payments made after the
Closing) as soon as reasonably practicable after such determination and (b)
each Party shall expend commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself of any
available exemptions from, or any refunds, credits or other recovery of, any
such Tax deductions and withholdings and shall cooperate with the other
Parties in providing any information and documentation (including an Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 or other applicable Form) that may be necessary to
obtain such exemptions, refunds, credits or other recovery. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



18

    

2.14 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time or the Second Effective Time, any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the
Surviving Corporation following the First Merger and the Surviving Entity
following the Second Merger with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub, the officers and directors (or their
designees) of the Company, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub are fully
authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is
not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _EARN OUT_

3.1  _Delivery of Earn Out Shares_. At the Closing, and as additional
consideration for the Mergers and the other Transactions, Parent shall issue
or cause to be issued to the Company Stockholders their portion of (a)
5,000,000 shares of Parent Class B Stock, and (b) 5,000,000 shares of Parent
Class C Stock (collectively the " _Earn Out Shares_ ") in accordance with the
Final Spreadsheet, which Earn Out Shares shall be subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Parent AandR Charter.

3.2 _Tax Treatment of_ _Earn Out Shares_. The issuance of Earn Out Shares to
Company Stockholders in respect of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock (and the issuance of the Parent Class A Stock upon a conversion of the
Earn Out Shares to Parent Class A Stock) shall be treated as consideration in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock by
the Parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Applicable Legal
Requirements.

 

ARTICLE IV

due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other Parties,
constitute the legal and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable

with or violate the Companys Governing Documents; (ii) assuming that the
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, filings or permits
referred to in _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)_ are duly and timely obtained or made,
conflict with or violate any Applicable Legal Requirements; (iii) result in
any breach of or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or materially impair the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries rights or, in a manner adverse to any of the Group
Companies, alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give
to any third party any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
(including any forced repurchase) or cancellation under, or result in the
creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any of the properties or
assets of any of the Group Companies pursuant to, any Company Material
Contracts, except, with respect to clause (iii) as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



22

of its obligations hereunder and thereunder will not, require any consent,

Governmental Entity, except for: (i) the filing of the First Certificate of
Merger and the Second Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL and
DLLCA; (ii) applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the

consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described on _Schedule_ __ _
4.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; and (v) where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole, or
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the Transactions or the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements.

 

4.6 _Compliance; Approvals_. Each of the Group Companies has, during the last
four (4) years, complied with and is not in violation of any Applicable Legal
Requirements with respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or
operation of its business, except for failures to comply or violations which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not been and are not reasonably likely
to be material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole. No written, or to the
Knowledge of the Company, oral notice of non-compliance with any Applicable
Legal Requirements has been received by any of the Group Companies from any
Franchisee or any Governmental Entity in the last four (4) years. Each Group
Company is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses,
permits, consents, certificates, approvals and orders from Governmental
Entities (" _Approvals_ ") necessary to own, lease and operate the properties
it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Group Companies, taken as a whole. Each Approval held by the Group Companies
is valid, binding and in full force and effect. None of the Group Companies
(a) are in default or violation (and no event has occurred that, with notice
or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any
material term, condition or provision of any such Approval, or (b)
have received any written notice from a Governmental Entity that has issued
any such Approval that it intends to cancel, terminate, modify or not renew
any such Approval except, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
the Group Companies, taken as a whole, or reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Transactions or
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
the other Transaction Agreements.

4.7 _Government Contracts_. With respect to any prime contract, subcontract,
basic ordering agreement, letter contract, purchase order or delivery order of
any kind, including all amendments, modifications and options thereunder or
relating thereto between any of the Group Companies and any Governmental
Entity (" _Government Contracts_ ") in effect on the date hereof,

 



23

    

 except as disclosed on _Schedule_ __ _ 4.7_ of the Company Disclosure

award protest proceedings and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such

protest proceedings; (b) the Group Companies have complied in all material
respects with all statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to each of
the Government Contracts and their associated quotations, bids and proposals;
(c) all facts set forth in or acknowledged by any representations,

Entity nor any prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor under a
Government Contract has disallowed any material costs claimed by the Group
Companies under such Government Contracts; (e) no Governmental Entity has
within the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof made any written claim
for any material price adjustment or any other request for a material
reduction in the price of any of such Government Contracts; (f) within the
last twelve (12) months, the Company has received no written notice
terminating any of the Companys Government Contracts for default or for
convenience or indicating an intent to terminate any such Government Contracts
for convenience; (g) neither the Group Companies nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Company Stockholder, or any director, manager or officer of the
Company, has been within the last four (4) years or is now suspended, debarred
or proposed for suspension or debarment from government contracting; and (h)
to the Knowledge of the Company, the Group Companies have not undergone and
are not undergoing any audit or investigation relating to such Government
Contracts, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such audit
or investigation, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

4.8 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of: (i)
the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries

the Company and its Subsidiaries, (y) "material weakness" in the internal
controls over financial reporting of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (z)
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who have a role in the internal controls over
financial reporting of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for liabilities: (a) provided for in, or
otherwise disclosed or reflected in the most recent balance sheet included in

any of the trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or administrator, or
against any fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan with respect to the
operation thereof. No event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company,

lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Legal
Requirements.

or materially reduce its relationship with the Group Companies other than, in
each case, with respect to any scheduled expiration or termination date
expressly set forth in such Franchise Agreement.

 



42

of Franchise Agreement contained in the Franchise Disclosure Document (if
applicable) for that particular jurisdiction that was issued to the applicable
Franchisee, except for any negotiated changes that the parties to such
agreements may have agreed to. There are no oral modifications of any

compliance in all material respects with all applicable Franchise Laws in
connection with the solicitation, offer, grant or sale of Franchises,
relationships with Franchisees, the operation of the Franchise System and the
termination, non-renewal and transfer of Franchises and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no current or former Franchisee or any Governmental Entity has

with any applicable Franchise Laws during its operation of the Franchise
System.

offer or sell Franchises at any time since January 1, 2017 or that are

furnished to prospective Franchisees and throughout the period preceding the
execution and delivery of a Franchise Agreement. The information in the
Franchise Disclosure Documents at the time they were used by a Group Company
in connection with the solicitation, offer, grant or sale of Franchises was
true and complete in all material respects and did not contain any untrue or
misleading statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and
included all information required by all applicable Franchise Laws. The
Franchise Disclosure Documents have been amended or supplemented from time to
time as required by applicable Franchise Law and such amendments and
supplements were timely and properly furnished to each applicable Governmental
Entity and Franchisees or prospective Franchisees as required by applicable
Franchise Law.

 



43

    

(g) A true and correct copy of all Franchise Disclosure Documents used by any
Group Company since January 1, 2017 has been delivered to Parent. Since the
date of the most recent Franchise Disclosure Documents used by any Group
Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there has
been no material change in the business, financial condition, or affairs of
the Group Companies, the Franchise System, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, the Franchisees that would, taken as a whole, require an amendment or
supplement to such Franchise Disclosure Documents prior to the date hereof.

(h) Each Franchisee who left the Franchise System since January 1, 2017 has
executed agreements with a Group Company which released the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any and all liabilities (whether direct or
indirect, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) and claims that such
Franchisee had, has or may have against the Company and its Affiliates which
relate in any way to the Franchisees Franchise Agreement.

(i) Since January 1, 2017, all rebates, allowances, discounts or other
payments or remunerations received by any Group Company from vendors,
suppliers or other third parties, on account of any Franchisees direct or
indirect purchases from those vendors, suppliers or third parties, have been
received, administered, disclosed and spent in accordance with the operation
manuals utilized by the Franchise System, all Franchise Laws, the Franchise
Disclosure Documents delivered to such Franchisees, the applicable
Franchise Agreement, and other applicable Contracts associated with the
Franchise System, in each case, in all material respects. Except as set forth
in the Franchise Agreements, there are no material restrictions on any Group
Companys use of any such rebates, allowances, discounts or other payments or
remuneration for any purpose.

(j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Group Companies have at all times
collected, maintained, administered, managed, directed, spent and utilized all
advertising and marketing funds (including any advertising cooperative funds)
contributed by or received from Franchisees in compliance with the
Franchise Agreements and applicable Franchise Law. No Franchisee has
delivered to the Company a written claim of any Group Companys breach of any
Franchise Agreements with respect to such advertising or marketing funds and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no facts exist that would reasonably be
expected to form the basis for any such a claim of breach of any Franchise
Agreement.

(k) No Group Company is (i) a guarantor or party to an agreement pursuant to
which any Group Company is directly or contingently liable (as a co-signor or
otherwise) for any obligation of any Franchisee, (ii) a lessor or sublessor
of any real or personal property to any Franchisee, or (iii) a party to any
financing arrangement with any Franchisee.

 

(l) No Group Company has engaged or hired an agent, broker, third party,
Franchisee or licensee to provide material services, assistance or support to
any Franchisee or to identify, offer or sell to potential Franchisees other
than in connection with negotiations with vendors on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries.

 



44

    

(m) To the Knowledge of the Company, no franchise association or other
organization is acting as a representative of any group of two or more
Franchisees. Any franchise council or advisory group presently in place
(whether independently formed or sponsored by the Company or its Subsidiaries)
is purely advisory in nature. No Group Company has granted any enforceable
right of first refusal, option or other right or arrangement to sign any
Franchise Agreement or acquire any Franchise Agreement.

 

4.22 _Insurance_. Each of the Group Companies maintains insurance policies or
fidelity or surety bonds covering its assets, business, equipment,
properties, operations, employees, officers and directors (collectively, the
"Insurance Policies") covering all material insurable risks in respect of its
business and assets, the Insurance Policies are in full force and effect, all
material premiums due to date thereunder have been paid in full, and no Group
Company is in default with respect to any other material obligations
thereunder. The coverages provided by such Insurance Policies are usual and
customary in amount and scope for the Group Companies business and
operations as concurrently conducted, and sufficient to comply with any
insurance required to be maintained by Company Material Contracts, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there have been no material claims or events with
respect to the business of the Group Companies that would be covered under a
usual or customary insurance policy but for which coverage was not purchased
by the Group Companies. No written notice of cancellation or termination has
been received by any Group Company with respect to any of the effective
Insurance Policies. There is no pending material claim by any Group Company
against any insurance carrier under any of the existing Insurance Policies for
which (i) coverage has been denied or disputed by the applicable insurance
carrier or (ii) that is being handled subject to a reservation of rights
notice. As of the date hereof, no Group Company has received written notice of
any outstanding requirements under any existing Insurance Policy for risk
improvements that are reasonably likely to give rise to a material capital
expenditure after the Closing. To the Knowledge of the Company, all incidents
which would reasonably be expected to result in a material claim after the
Closing have been notified to the relevant insurers under the Insurance
Policies.

4.23 _Interested Party Transactions_. No (a) employee, officer or director of
any Group Company, (b) Company Stockholder or holder of securities or
derivative securities of any Group Company or (c) a member of any of the
respective immediate families of any of the foregoing is indebted to any
Group Company for borrowed money, nor are any of the Group Companies indebted
for borrowed money (or committed to make loans or extend or guarantee credit)
to any of such Persons, other than: (i) for payment of salary, bonuses and
other compensation for services rendered; (ii) reimbursement for reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with any of the Group Companies; and (iii) for
other employee benefits made generally available to all employees. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no officer, director, employee, Company Stockholder
or holder of securities or derivative securities of the Group Companies (each,
an "Insider") or any member of an Insiders immediate family is, directly or
indirectly, interested in any Contract with any of the Group Companies (other
than such Contracts relate to any such Persons ownership of Company Common
Stock or other securities of the Group Companies or such Persons employment
or consulting arrangements with the Group Companies).

respective Governing Documents; (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, filings or permits referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ are duly and timely obtained or made, conflict with or

or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or materially impair their respective rights or
alter the rights or obligations of any third party under, or give to others
any rights of consent, termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any
of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to,
any Contracts, except, with respect to clause (iii), as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



53

    

(b) The execution and delivery by each of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second
Merger Sub of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements to which it
is a party, does not, and the performance of its obligations hereunder and

of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except: (i)
for the filing of the Certificates of Merger in accordance with the DGCL and
DLLCA, as applicable; (ii) for applicable requirements, if any, of the

required under the HSR Act, any filings required pursuant to antitrust laws
and the expiration of the required waiting periods thereunder; and (iv) where
the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or
to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to Parent or reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay or materially impair the consummation
of the Transactions or the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements.

5.6  _Compliance; Approvals_. Since its incorporation or organization, as
applicable, each of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub has
complied in all material respects with and has not been in violation of any
Applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the conduct of its business, or
the ownership or operation of its business. Since the date of its
incorporation or organization, as applicable, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries has been pending or threatened. No written, or to the
Knowledge of Parent, oral notice of non-compliance with any Applicable Legal
Requirements has been received by any of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second
Merger Sub. Each of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub is in
possession of all Approvals necessary to own, lease and operate the properties
it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub, taken as a whole. Each
Approval held by Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub is valid,
binding and in full force and effect. None of Parent, First Merger Sub or
Second Merger Sub: (a) are in default or violation (and no event has occurred
that, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation) of any material term, condition or provision of any such Approval;
or (b) have received any notice from a Governmental Entity that has issued any
such Approval that it intends to cancel, terminate, modify or not renew any
such Approval.

5.7 _Parent SEC Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by Parent with the SEC under the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act since Parents incorporation to the date of
this Agreement, together with any amendments, restatements or supplements
thereto (all of the foregoing filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "), and will have filed all such forms, reports,
schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed subsequent to
the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date (the " _Additional Parent
SEC Reports_ "). All Parent SEC Reports, Additional Parent SEC Reports, any
correspondence from or to the SEC or Nasdaq (other than such correspondence in
connection with the initial public offering of Parent) and all certifications
and statements required by: (i) Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act;
or (ii) 18 U.S.C. § 1350 (Section 906) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Certifications_ ") are available

54

    

 Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (EDGAR) in full without redaction.
Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company true and correct copies of all
amendments and modifications that have not been filed by Parent with the SEC
to all agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been
filed by Parent with the SEC and are currently in effect. The Parent SEC
Reports were, and the Additional Parent SEC Reports will be, prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations thereunder. The Parent SEC Reports did not, and
the Additional Parent SEC Reports will not, at the time they were or are
filed, as the case may be, with the SEC contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Certifications
are each true and correct in all material respects. Parent maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act. Each director and executive officer of Parent has
filed with the SEC on a timely basis all statements required with respect to
Parent by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. As used in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, the term "file" shall be
broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC or Nasdaq.

(b) The financial statements and notes of Parent contained or incorporated by
reference in the Parent SEC Reports fairly present in all material respects,
and the financial statements and notes of Parent to be contained in or to be
incorporated by reference in the Additional Parent SEC Reports will fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition and the results of
operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of Parent as at the
respective dates of, and for the periods referred to, in such financial
statements, all in accordance with: (i) U.S. GAAP; and (ii) Regulation S-X or
Regulation S-K, as applicable, subject, in the case of interim financial
statements, to normal recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which will
not, individually or in the aggregate, be material) and the omission of notes
to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable.
Parent has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are not disclosed in
the Parent SEC Reports. No financial statements other than those of Parent
are required by U.S. GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial
statements of Parent.

 

5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as set forth in Parent SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and except as contemplated
by this Agreement, since December 31, 2019, there has not been: (a) any Parent
Material Adverse Effect; (b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend on, or other distribution in respect of, any of Parents capital
stock, or any purchase, redemption or other acquisition by Parent of any of
Parents capital stock or any other securities of Parent or any options,
warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other securities; (c)
any split, combination or reclassification of any of Parents capital stock;
(d) any material change by Parent in its accounting methods, principles or
practices, except as required by concurrent changes in U.S. GAAP (or any
interpretation thereof) or Applicable Legal Requirements; (e) any change in
the auditors of Parent; (f) any issuance of capital stock of Parent; (g) any
revaluation by Parent of any of its assets, including any sale of assets of
Parent other than in the Ordinary Course of Business; or (h) any action taken
or agreed upon by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would be prohibited
by _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ if such action were taken on or after the date hereof
without the consent of the Company.

 



55

    

5.9 _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened in writing against or otherwise relating to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, before any Governmental Entity: (a) challenging or
seeking to enjoining, alter or materially delay the Transactions or (b) that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to Parent.

5.10 _Business Activities_. Since their respective dates of incorporation,
none of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub has conducted any
business activities other than activities: (a) in connection with its
organization; (b) in connection with its initial public offering; or (c)
directed toward the accomplishment of a business combination. Except as set
forth in the Parent Organizational Documents, there is no Contract or Order
binding upon Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub or to which any of
them is a party which has or could reasonably be expected to have the effect
of prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of it, any
acquisition of property by it or the conduct of business by it as currently
conducted or as currently contemplated to be conducted (including, in each
case, following the Closing).

5.11  _Parent_ __ _ Material_ __ _ Contracts_. _Schedule_ __ _ 5.11_ of
the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct and complete list of
each "material contract" (as such term is defined in Regulation S-K) to which
Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub is party (the " _Parent Material
Contracts_ "), other than any such Parent Material Contract that is listed as
an exhibit to Parents annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2019.

 

5.12 _Parent Listing_. The Parent Units are registered pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital
Markets (" _Nasdaq_ ") under the symbol "CRSAU". The issued and outstanding
shares of Parent Class A Stock are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the
Exchange Act and are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "CRSA".
The issued and outstanding Parent Warrants are registered pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act and are listed for trading on Nasdaq under the
symbol "CRSAW". Parent is a member in good standing with Nasdaq. Parent has
complied in all material respects with all applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of Nasdaq, including the requirements for
continued listing of the Parent Units, Parent Class A Stock and Parent
Warrants on Nasdaq. There is no action or proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent by Nasdaq or the SEC
with respect to any intention by such entity to deregister the Parent Units,
the shares of Parent Class A Stock or Parent Warrants or to terminate the
listing of Parent on Nasdaq. None of Parent or any of its Affiliates has taken
any action in an attempt to terminate the registration of the Parent
Units, the Parent Class A Stock or Parent Warrants under the Exchange Act.

5.13 _Trust Account_.

 

(a) As of June 19, 2020, Parent had $254,185,388 in a trust account (the "
_Trust Account_ "), maintained and invested pursuant to that certain
Investment Management Trust Agreement (the " _Trust Agreement_ ") effective as
of March 7, 2019, by and between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, a New York corporation (" _Continental_ ") for the benefit of its
public stockholders, with such funds invested in United States Government
securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under

 



56

    

 the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As of June 19, 2020, Parent
held $823,009 in cash or cash equivalents outside of the Trust Account. Other
than pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Forward Purchase Agreement, the
obligations of Parent under this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding Parents, its Affiliates, or any other Persons ability to obtain
financing for the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and, to the Knowledge
of Parent with respect to Continental, is valid and in full force and effect
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except insofar as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors
rights generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable
remedies. Parent has complied in all material respects with the terms of the
Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there
does not exist under the Trust Agreement any event that, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default by
Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, Continental. There are no separate
Contracts, side letters or other understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied): (i) between Parent and Continental that would
cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Parent SEC Reports to be
inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) to the Knowledge of Parent, that
would entitle any Person (other than stockholders of Parent holding Parent
Class A Stock sold in Parents initial public offering who shall have elected
to redeem their shares of Parent Class A Stock pursuant to Parents Governing
Documents or the underwriters of the initial public offering with respect to
any deferred underwriting compensation) to any portion of the proceeds in the
Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust
Account may be released except: (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any
interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) to redeem Parent Class A
Stock in accordance with the provisions of Parents Governing Documents.
There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing with respect to the Trust Account.

 

5.14 _Taxes_.

(a) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of Parent,
First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub have been duly and timely filed with
the appropriate Governmental Entity and all such Tax Returns are true, correct
and complete in all material respects. All material amounts of Taxes payable
by or on behalf of Parent, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub (whether or
not shown on any Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid.

 

(b) No claim, assessment, deficiency or proposed adjustment for any material
amount of Tax has been asserted or assessed by any Governmental Entity in
writing (or otherwise to the Knowledge of Parent) against Parent, First Merger
Sub and Second Merger Sub which has not been paid or resolved. No material Tax
audit or other examination of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub
by any Governmental Entity is presently in progress, nor has Parent been
notified in writing of (nor to the Knowledge of Parent has there been) any
request or threat for such an audit or other examination. There are no liens
for Taxes (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the assets of Parent,
First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub. Neither Parent, First Merger Sub nor
Second Merger Sub has: (i) consented to extend the time in which any material
amount of Tax may be assessed or collected by any Governmental Entity (other
than pursuant to extensions of time to file Tax Returns obtained in the
Ordinary Course of Business),

 



57

    

 which extension is still in effect; or (ii) has entered into or been a party
to any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Section 6707A(c)(2) of the
Code. Neither Parent, First Merger Sub nor Second Merger Sub has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of
stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the
Code in the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent,
First Merger Sub nor Second Merger Sub has any liability for the Taxes of
another Person (other than the Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub)
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Legal Requirements) or as a transferee or a successor
or by Contract (other than pursuant to the Transaction Agreements or pursuant
to commercial agreements entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business and
the principal purpose of which is not related to Taxes).

(c) Parent has not taken any action and is not aware of any fact or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the First Merger
and the Second Merger, taken together, from constituting an integrated
transaction described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321 that qualifies as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations.

(d) All of the membership interests in Second Merger Sub are owned by Parent,
and Second Merger Sub is, and has been since formation, disregarded as an
entity (within the meaning of Section 301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations)
separate from Parent for United States federal income tax purposes.

5.15 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date mailed to stockholders of Parent or at the time of
the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes
no representation, warranty or covenant with respect to: (a) statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
Group Companies for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement; or (b) any projections or forecasts included in the Proxy
Statement.

5.16 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. Other than any former officers or as
described in the Parent SEC Reports, Parent has never had any employees. Other
than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
Parents officers and directors in connection with activities on Parents
behalf in an aggregate amount not in excess of the amount of cash held by
Parent outside of the Trust Account, Parent has no unsatisfied material
liability with respect to any employee. Parent does not currently maintain or
have any direct liability under any benefit plan, and neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements nor the
consummation of the Transactions will: (a) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any director, officer or employee of Parent; or (b) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

 



58

    

5.17 _Board Approval; Stockholder Vote_. The Parent Board (including any
required committee or subgroup of the Parent Board) has, as of the date of
this Agreement, unanimously: (a) approved and declared the advisability of
this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the
Transactions; and (b) determined that the consummation of the Transactions is
in the best interest of the stockholders of Parent. Other than the approval of
the by the stockholders of Parent of the Parent Stockholder Matters, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to approve the
consummation of the Transactions.

5.18 _Title to Assets_. Subject to the restrictions on use of the Trust
Account set forth in the Trust Agreement, Parent owns good and marketable
title to, or holds a valid leasehold interest in, or a valid license to use,
all of the assets used by Parent in the operation of its business and that
are material to Parent, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted
Liens).

5.19 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except for equity ownership or employment
relationships (including any employment or similar Contract) expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, any non-disclosure or confidentiality Contract
entered into in connection with the "wall-crossing" of Parents stockholders,
any Transaction Agreement, or as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.19_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, (a) there are no transactions or Contracts, or
series of related transactions or Contracts, between Parent, on the one hand,
and any Related Party of Parent, Sponsor, Crescent, any beneficial owner (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of five percent (5%) or more of
Parent Shares or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective
"associates" or "immediate family" members (as such terms are defined in Rule
12b-2 and Rule 16a-1 of the Exchange Act), on the other hand, nor is any
Indebtedness owed by or to Parent, on the one hand, to or by Sponsor, Crescent
or any such Related Party, beneficial owner, associate or immediate
family member, and (b) none of the officers or directors (or members of a
similar governing body) of Parent, Sponsor, Crescent, any beneficial owner of
five percent (5%) or more of Parent Shares or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
their respective "associates" or "immediate family members" owns directly or
indirectly in whole or in part, or has any other material interest in, (i) any
material tangible or real property that Parent or uses, owns or leases (other
than through any equity interest in Parent) or (ii) any customer, vendor or
other material business relation of Parent, Sponsor or Crescent.

 

5.20 _Forward Purchase Agreement_. Parent has delivered to the Company and the
Stockholder Representative a true, accurate and complete copy of the Forward
Purchase Agreement. The Forward Purchase Agreement is in full force and effect
and has not been withdrawn, terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, in
any respect, and no withdrawal, termination, amendment or modification
is contemplated by Parent, and the commitments contained in the Forward
Purchase Agreement have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded by
Crescent in any respect. The Forward Purchase Agreement is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Crescent, enforceable in accordance with its
terms. The Forward Purchase Agreement provides that the Company and the
Stockholder Representative are third-party beneficiaries thereof and are
entitled to enforce such agreement. There are no other agreements, side
letters, or arrangements between Parent and any other Person (including
Crescent) relating to the Forward Purchase Transaction, and, as of the date
hereof, Parent does not know of any facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in the
Forward Purchase Agreement not being satisfied, or the Forward Purchase
Investment Amount not being available to Parent, on the Closing Date. The
Forward 

 



59

    

 Purchase Agreement contains all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of Crescent to contribute to Parent the Forward Purchase
Investment Amount on the terms therein. No event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent or Crescent under any condition precedent or material term
of the Forward Purchase Agreement and, as of the date hereof, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the consummation of the
Forward Purchase Transaction will not be satisfied, and, as of the date
hereof, Parent is not aware of the existence of any fact or event that would
or would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions not to be satisfied.

5.21 _Investment Company Act; JOBS Act_. Parent is not an
"investment company" or a Person directly or indirectly "controlled" by or
acting on behalf of a person subject to registration and regulation as an
"investment company," in each case, within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act. Parent constitutes an "emerging growth company" within the
meaning of the JOBS Act.

5.22 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Parent and its Subsidiaries have no
liabilities (whether direct or indirect, absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a balance sheet in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for liabilities: (a) provided for in, or
otherwise disclosed or reflected in the most recent balance sheet included in

2020; (c) incurred since March 31, 2020 pursuant to or in connection with this

5.23 _Brokers_. None of Parent, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, nor any
of their respective Affiliates, including Sponsor, has any liability or
obligation to pay, or is entitled to receive, any fees or commissions to any
broker, finder or agent with respect to the Transactions.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

7.1 _Proxy Statement; Special Meeting_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent shall, in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_,
prepare and file with the SEC, in preliminary form, a proxy statement in
connection with the Transactions (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the "Proxy Statement") to be sent to the stockholders of Parent
relating to the Special Meeting, for the purpose of, among other things: (A)
providing Parents stockholders with notice of the opportunity to redeem
shares of Parent Class A Stock (the "Parent Stockholder Redemption"); and (B)
soliciting proxies from holders of Parent Class A Stock to vote at the Special
Meeting in favor of: (1) the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Transactions; (2) the issuance of shares of Parent Class A Stock in
connection with _Section_ __ _ 2.6_; (3) the amendment and restatement of the
Parent Organizational Documents substantially in the form of the Parent AandR
Charter attached hereto as  _Exhibit_ __ _ C_; (4) adoption of the 2020
Equity Incentive Plan; and (5) any other proposals the Parties deem necessary
or desirable to consummate the Transactions (collectively, the "Parent
Stockholder Matters"). Without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Parent
Stockholder Matters shall be the only matters (other than procedural matters)
which Parent shall propose to be acted on by the Parents stockholders at the
Special Meeting. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form and substance with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Parent shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders of record, as of
the record date to be established by the Parent Board, as promptly as
practicable following the earlier to occur of: (Y) in the event the
preliminary Proxy Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, the expiration of the
waiting period in Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act; and (Z) in the event
the preliminary Proxy Statement is reviewed by the SEC, receipt of oral or
written notification of the completion of the review by the SEC (such earlier
date, the "Proxy Clearance Date").

 



68

    

(ii) Prior to filing with the SEC, Parent will make available to the
Company drafts of the Proxy Statement and any other documents to be filed
with the SEC related to the Transactions, both preliminary and final, and any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or such other document and will
provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts
and shall consider such comments in good faith. Parent shall not file any such
documents with the SEC without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent will
advise the Company promptly after it receives notice thereof of: (A) the time
when the Proxy Statement has been filed; (B) in the event the preliminary
Proxy Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, the expiration of the waiting
period in Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act; (C) in the event the
preliminary Proxy Statement is reviewed by the SEC, receipt of oral or written
notification of the completion of the review by the SEC; (D) the filing of
any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement; (E) the issuance of any
stop order by the SEC; (F) any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement; (G) any comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement and
responses thereto; and (H) requests by the SEC for additional information
relating to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall promptly respond to any SEC
comments on the Proxy Statement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC under the Exchange Act as promptly
as practicable; _provided_ that prior to responding to any requests or
comments from the SEC, Parent will make available to the Company drafts of
any such response and provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such drafts.

 

(iii) If, at any time prior to the Special Meeting, there shall be discovered
any information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, Parent shall promptly file an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement containing such information. If, at any time prior to the
Closing, the Company discovers any information, event or circumstance relating
to the Company, its business or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors or
employees that should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then the Company shall promptly inform Parent of such
information, event or circumstance.

 

(iv) Parent shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Transactions
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and applicable "blue sky" laws,
and any rules and regulations thereunder. The Company agrees to promptly
provide Parent with all information concerning the business, management,
operations and financial condition of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case, reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cause the officers and employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to be reasonably available to Parent and
its counsel, auditors and other advisors in connection with the drafting of
the Proxy Statement and responding in a timely manner to comments on the Proxy
Statement from the SEC.

 



69

    

(b) Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the Proxy Clearance
Date, establish a record date (which date shall be mutually agreed with the
Company) for, duly call and give notice of, the Special Meeting. Parent shall
convene and hold a meeting of Parents stockholders (the "Special Meeting"),
for the purpose of obtaining the approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters,
which meeting shall be held not more than forty-five (45) days after the date
on which Parent mails the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of the Parent
Stockholder Matters at the Special Meeting, including by soliciting proxies as
promptly as practicable in accordance with Applicable Legal Requirements for
the purpose of seeking the approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters.
Subject to the proviso in the immediately following sentence, Parent shall
include the Parent Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 

(c) The Parent Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof shall)
change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to change,
withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Parent Recommendation (a "Change in
Recommendation"); _provided_ that the Parent Board may make a Change in
Recommendation in response to either a Superior Proposal or an Intervening
Event if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that a failure to make a Change in Recommendation would
constitute a breach by the Parent Board of its fiduciary obligations to
Parents stockholders under Applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Parent Board may not make Change in Recommendation in
response to a Superior Proposal unless:

 

(i) Parent notifies the Company in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so (the "Notice Period"),
and specifies the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the Person making, such Superior Proposal, and
contemporaneously furnishes a copy (if any) of the proposed Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents (it being
understood and agreed that if there is any material amendment to the financial
terms (including any such material amendment (it being understood that there
may be multiple extensions)) or other terms of such Superior Proposal after
the commencement of the Notice Period, the Notice Period shall be extended to
ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remain in the Notice Period
subsequent to the date Parent notifies the Company of the material
amendment); and

(ii) if the Company makes a proposal during such Notice Period to adjust the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board, after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by the Company, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make a Change in
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent under Applicable
Legal Requirements;

 



70

    

_provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent Board may not make a Change in
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event unless:

(iii) Parent provides the Company with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable
after becoming aware of it;

(iv) Parent keeps the Company reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Intervening Event;

(v) Parent notifies the Company in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before making a Change in Recommendation with respect to such Intervening
Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons therefor; and

 

(vi) if the Company makes a proposal during such four (4) Business Day period
to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by the Company, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make such Change in
Recommendation would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
stockholders of Parent under Applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(d) During the Notice Period prior to its effecting a Change in
Recommendation, Parent shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, negotiate with the Company in good faith (to the extent the
Company seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

(e) Parent agrees that its obligation to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting for the purpose of
seeking approval of the Parent Stockholder Matters (and its obligation to use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals) shall not be affected by
any Change in Recommendation, and Parent agrees to establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special Meeting and
submit for the approval of its stockholders the matters contemplated by the
Proxy Statement as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_, regardless of
whether or not there shall have occurred any Change in Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting: (i) to ensure
that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Parent Board
has determined in good faith is required by Applicable Legal Requirements is
disclosed to Parents stockholders and for such supplement or amendment to be
promptly disseminated to Parents stockholders prior to the Special Meeting;
(ii) if, as of the time for which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Parent
Class A Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Special
Meeting; (iii) to seek withdrawals of redemption requests

 



71

    

 from Parents stockholders if Parent reasonably expects the Parent
Stockholder Redemption payments would cause the condition in _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_ to not be satisfied at the Closing; or (iv) in order to solicit
additional proxies from stockholders for purposes of obtaining approval of the
Parent Stockholder Matters; _provided_ that unless the Company shall otherwise
consent in writing in its sole discretion, Parent may not postpone or adjourn
the Special Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant to clauses (ii),
(iii) and (iv) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that
in the event of a postponement or adjournment pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii)
above, the Special Meeting shall be reconvened as promptly as practicable
following such time as the matters described in such clauses have been
resolved.

 

7.2 _Certain Regulatory Matters_. As promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall each prepare and file the
notification required of it under the HSR Act in connection with the
Transactions, a filing with the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board
(the "FIRB Filing") in connection with the Transactions and any other required
filings under other applicable antitrust laws and shall promptly and in good
faith respond to all information requested of it by the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, U.S. Department of Justice and the Australian Foreign Investment
Review Board in connection with such notification and filings and otherwise
cooperate in good faith with each other and such Governmental Entities. Each
Party (other than the Stockholder Representative) will promptly furnish to
the other such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request
in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act, the FIRB Filing or other applicable antitrust
laws and will take all other actions necessary or desirable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods as soon as
practicable. Each Party will promptly provide the other with copies of all
written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of all oral
communications) between each of them, any of their Affiliates and their
respective agents, representatives and advisors, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall:
(a) promptly inform the other of any substantive communication to or from the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Australian
Foreign Investment Review Board or any other Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions; (b) permit each other to review in advance any proposed
substantive written communication to any such Governmental Entity and
incorporate reasonable comments thereto; (c) give the other prompt written
notice of the commencement of any Legal Proceeding with respect to such
transactions; (d) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Transactions unless,
to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other Party
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives
the other Party the opportunity to attend; (e) keep the other reasonably
informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding; and (f) promptly
furnish each other with copies of all correspondence, filings (to the extent
allowed under Applicable Legal Requirements) and written communications
between such Party and their Affiliates and their respective agents,
representatives and advisors, on one hand, and any such Governmental Entity,
on the other hand, in each case, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any filing fees required
by Governmental Entities, including with respect to any registrations,
declarations and filings required in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the performance of the obligations hereunder and
the consummation of the Transactions, including filing fees in connection
with filings under the HSR Act, the FIRB Filing and any other applicable
antitrust laws.

 



72

    

7.3 _Other Filings; Press Release_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after execution of this Agreement, Parent will
prepare and file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act to
report the execution of this Agreement, the form and substance of which shall
be approved in advance in writing by the Company.

 

(b) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall also issue a joint press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement.

the SEC.

7.4  _Confidentiality; Communications Plan; Access to Information_.

(a) Parent and the Company acknowledge that they are parties to
the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Following Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
superseded in its entirety by the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms. Beginning on the date hereof
and ending on the second anniversary of this Agreement, each Party agrees to
maintain in confidence any non-public information received from the other
Parties, and to use such non-public information only for purposes of
consummating the Transactions. Such confidentiality obligations will not apply
to: (i) information which was known to one Party or its agents or
representatives prior to receipt from the Company or the Company Stockholders,
on the one hand, or Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub, on the
other hand, as applicable; (ii) information which is or becomes generally
known to the public without breach of this Agreement or an existing obligation

agents from a third party who was not bound to an obligation of
confidentiality; (iv) information developed by such Party independently
without any reliance on the non-public information received from any other
Party; (v) disclosure required by Applicable Legal Requirement or stock
exchange rule; or (vi) disclosure consented to in writing by Parent, First
Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub (in the case of the Company Stockholders and,
prior to the Closing, the Company) or the Stockholder Representative (in the
case of Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub and, following the 

 



73

    

 Closing, the Company). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, following Closing, the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted
to disclose information as required by law or to employees, advisors, agents
or consultants of the Stockholder Representative and to the Company
Stockholders, in each case who have a need to know such information, provided
that such persons are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect
thereto.

(b) Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate to create and implement
a communications plan regarding the Transactions (the "Communications Plan")
promptly following the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Parties will make any public announcement or issue any public communication
regarding this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the
Transactions or any matter related to the foregoing, without the prior written
consent of the Company, in the case of a public announcement by Parent, or
Parent, in the case of a public announcement by the
Stockholder Representative, any Company Stockholder or the Company (such
consents, in either case, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except: (i) if such announcement or other communication is required
by Applicable Legal Requirements, in which case the disclosing Party shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Legal Requirements, first allow such
other Parties to review such announcement or communication and have the
opportunity to comment thereon and the disclosing Party shall consider such
comments in good faith; (ii) no consent of the Stockholder Representative, the
Company or the Company Stockholders shall be required with respect to
announcement by Parent or its Affiliates, if such announcement or other
communication is made in connection with fundraising or other investment
related activities and is made to such Persons direct and indirect investors
or potential investors or financing sources subject to an obligation
of confidentiality; (iii) to the extent provided for in the Communications
Plan, internal announcements to employees of the Group Companies; (iv) to the
extent such announcements or other communications contain only information
previously disclosed in a public statement, press release or other
communication previously approved in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or
this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_; and (v) announcements and communications
to Governmental Entities in connection with registrations, declarations and
filings relating to the Transactions required to be made under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following Closing
and after the public announcement of the Mergers, the Stockholder
Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Stockholder Representative in connection with the
Mergers as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms
of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated herein.

(c) The Company will afford Parent and its financial advisors, accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books, records and
personnel of the Company during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all
information concerning the business, including the status of business
development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company, as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be
conducted in a manner not to materially interfere with the businesses or
operations of the Company. Parent will afford the Company and its financial
advisors, underwriters, accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice, to the properties, books, records and personnel of Parent during the
period prior to the Closing to obtain all information concerning the
business, including properties, results of operations and personnel of Parent,
as the Company may reasonably request in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be
conducted in a manner not to interfere with the businesses or operations of
Parent.

 



74

    

7.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties (other than the Stockholder
Representative) agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Mergers and the other Transactions, including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (a) the taking of all
commercially reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ to be satisfied; (b) the obtaining of all
necessary actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations
from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings, including registrations, declarations and filings
with Governmental Entities, if any, and any filings required pursuant
to antitrust laws and the taking of all commercially reasonable steps as may
be necessary to avoid any Legal Proceeding; (c) the obtaining of all consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of the
Transactions, including any consents referred to on _Schedule_ __ _ 4.5(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that nothing herein shall require the Company in connection therewith
to incur any liability or expense or subject itself, any of its Subsidiaries
or the business of the foregoing to any imposition of any limitation on the
ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control
of their assets or properties); (d) the termination of each agreement set
forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 7.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; (e) the
defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed; and (f) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, the Transactions. This obligation shall include, on the part of
Parent, sending a termination letter to Continental substantially in the
applicable form attached to the Trust Agreement (the "Trust Termination
Letter"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the Company to agree to any
divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of shares of capital stock or
of any business, assets or property, the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise control
of their respective assets, properties and capital stock, or the incurrence
of any liability or expense.

7.6 _No Parent Securities Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
controlled Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall engage in any
transactions involving the securities of Parent prior to the time of the
making of a public announcement regarding all of the material terms of the
business and operations of the Company and the Transactions. The Company shall
instruct its directors, officers and employees to comply with the foregoing
requirement.

 

7.7 _No Claim Against Trust Account_. For and in consideration of Parent
entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, each of the Company and the Stockholder Representative hereby
irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind it has or
may have in the future in or to the Trust Account and agrees not to 

 



75

    

 seek recourse against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom
as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement and any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with Parent;  _provided_ that: (a) nothing herein
shall serve to limit or prohibit the Companys or the Stockholder
Representatives right to pursue a claim against Parent pursuant to this
Agreement for legal relief against monies or other assets of Parent held
outside the Trust Account or for specific performance or other equitable
relief in connection with the Transactions (so long as such claim would not
affect Parents ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate any Parent
Stockholder Redemption) or for intentional fraud in the making of the
representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _ V_; and (b) nothing herein
shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company or
the Stockholder Representative may have in the future pursuant to this
Agreement against Parents assets or funds that are not held in the Trust
Account.

 

7.8 _Disclosure of Certain Matters_. Each of Parent, First Merger Sub, Second
Merger Sub, the Company and the Stockholder Representative will promptly
provide the other Parties with prompt written notice of any event, development
or condition of which they have Knowledge that: (a) is reasonably likely to
cause any of the conditions set forth in  _Article_ __ _ VIII_ not to be
satisfied; or (b) would require any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement.

 

7.9 _Securities Listing_. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Class A Stock issued in connection with the
Transactions, including the Parent Class A Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Parent Class B-1 Stock, Parent Class B-2 Stock, Parent Class C-1 Stock and
Parent Class C-2 Stock, to be approved for listing on Nasdaq at Closing.
During the period from the date hereof until the Closing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep the Parent Class A Stock and Parent Warrants
listed for trading on Nasdaq. After the Closing, Parent shall

ARTICLE XI

 

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

 

11.1 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By executing a Support Agreement, voting in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the Mergers, and the
consummation of the Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the
benefits thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Mergers, each Company Stockholder shall be deemed to have
approved the designation of, and hereby designates, Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as the Stockholder Representative for all purposes
in connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The
Stockholder Representative shall 

 



89

    

 act as the representative of the Company Stockholders in respect of all
matters arising under this Agreement or the Transaction Agreements, and shall
be authorized to act, or refrain from acting, with respect to any actions to
be taken by or on behalf of any Company Stockholder or the Stockholder
Representative, including to enforce any rights granted to any Company
Stockholder hereunder, in each case as the Stockholder
Representative believes is necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and
the Transaction Agreements, for and on behalf of the Company Stockholders. The
Company Stockholders shall be bound by all such actions taken by the
Stockholder Representative and no Company Stockholder shall be permitted to
take any such actions. The Stockholder Representative is serving as the
Stockholder Representative solely for purposes of administrative convenience,
and is not personally liable (except in its capacity as a Company Stockholder
hereunder if applicable) for any of the obligations of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of Company Stockholders hereunder, and Parent (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) agrees that it will not look to the Stockholder
Representative or the underlying assets of the Stockholder Representative for
the satisfaction of any obligations of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of the Company Stockholders. The Stockholder Representative shall not
be liable for any error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted
to be taken, in connection with the performance by the Stockholder
Representative of the Stockholder Representatives duties or the exercise by
the Stockholder Representative of the Stockholder Representatives rights and
remedies under this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or any agreement
ancillary hereto, except in the case of its fraud, bad faith or willful
misconduct. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative. The
Stockholder Representative may consult with legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with
the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The Stockholder
Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have the
full power and authority to interpret all the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, and to consent to any amendment
hereof or thereof on behalf of all Company Stockholders and their respective
successors. Parent shall be entitled to rely on all statements,
representations, decisions of, and actions taken or omitted to be taken by,
the Stockholder Representative relating to this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement.

(b) The Company Stockholders, severally and not jointly, in accordance with
the Contribution Percentage Obligation allocated to each such Company
Stockholder in the Final Spreadsheet, will indemnify and hold harmless the
Stockholder Representative from and against any and all liabilities and
Losses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) arising
out of or in connection with the Stockholder Representatives execution
and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction Agreement, in each case
as such Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ that in the event that any
such Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the fraud,
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Company
Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Loss to the extent attributable to
such fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Company Stockholders, any
such liabilities or Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative
from (i) the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount and (ii) any
other funds that become payable to the Company Stockholders under this
Agreement at such time as such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the
Company

 



90

    

 Stockholders; _provided_ , that while this section allows the Stockholder
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Company Stockholders from their obligation to promptly pay
such liabilities or Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to
it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be
required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Company Stockholders or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of,
or provisions limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable
to, the Company Stockholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder
Representative under this section. The Company Stockholders acknowledge and
agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the resignation or removal
of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount will be used for
the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Stockholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto. The Company Stockholders will
not receive any interest or earnings on the Stockholder Representative Expense
Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholder
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback
Amount other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available
to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following
the completion of the Stockholder Representatives responsibilities,
the Stockholder Representative shall cause (at the Company Stockholders
expense) the disbursement of any remaining balance of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Holdback Amount to the Company Stockholders based on a
pro rata basis in accordance with the percentage of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Holdback Amount allocated to such Company Stockholder
in the Final Spreadsheet, except in the case of payments to employees or
former employees of the Company for which employment tax withholding is
required, which such amounts shall be delivered to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and paid through Parents or the Surviving Corporations payroll
processing service or system. For tax purposes, the Stockholder
Representative Expense Holdback Amount shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Stockholders at the time of
Closing. The parties agree that the Stockholder Representative is not acting
as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the
Stockholder Representative Expense Holdback Amount.

(d) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time by giving twenty
(20) days notice to Parent and the Company Stockholders; _provided_ ,
_however_ , in the event of the resignation or removal of the Stockholder
Representative, a new Stockholder Representative (who shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent) shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of a
majority of the shares of Parent Common Stock, voting together as a single
class (with each such share entitled to one vote), then held by the Company
Stockholders.

with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that each Party shall be entitled to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
having jurisdiction pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.9_, without the necessity
of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without bond or
other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby
acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove damages with
reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure suitable substitute
performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific performance will not
cause an undue hardship to the Parties. Each of the Parties hereby further
acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy contemplated by
this Agreement does not diminish the availability of specific performance of
the obligations hereunder or any other injunctive relief. Each Party hereby
further agrees that in the event of any action by any other party for specific
performance or injunctive relief, it will not assert that a remedy at law or
other remedy would be adequate or that specific performance or injunctive
relief in respect of such breach or violation should not be available on the
grounds that money damages are adequate or any other grounds.

 



94

    

(b) The parties further agree that the Company would suffer irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties to the Forward Purchase
Agreement do not perform their obligations under the provisions of the Forward
Purchase Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of
them thereunder to consummate the Forward Purchase Transaction) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) if the parties to the Forward Purchase
Agreement do not perform their obligations under the provisions of the Forward
Purchase Agreement, then (1) the Company shall have the right to either (at
the Companys election) (I) on behalf of Parent, seek an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of the Forward
Purchase Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof, without proof of damages or (II) seek an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to cause Parent to prevent breaches of
the Forward Purchase Agreement and to cause Parent to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions thereof, without proof of damages, in each case of the
foregoing clauses (I) and (II), prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which it is entitled under this Agreement, and (2) Parent
shall not object or otherwise oppose any Legal Proceeding pursuant to which
the Company is exercising its rights pursuant to the foregoing clause (1), and
(ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none
of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

11.8  _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the consummation the Transactions,
and any action, suit, dispute, controversy or claim arising out of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal law of the State of Delaware regardless of the law that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_ _; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Sections_ __ _ 2.11(f)_, _3.2(b)_ and _7.13_ ,

venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, solely to the
extent that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware), in each case in connection with any matter based upon
or arising out of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the
consummation of the Transactions, agrees that process may be served upon them
in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such Person
and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might
otherwise have to such manner of service of process. Each Party and any
Person asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary may do so only if he,
she or it hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any legal
dispute, that: (a) such Person is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason; (b) such Legal Proceeding may not
be brought or is not maintainable in such court; (c) such Persons property is
exempt or immune from execution; (d) such Legal Proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum; or (e) the venue of such Legal Proceeding is improper.
Each Party and any Person asserting rights as a third-party beneficiary hereby
agrees not to commence or prosecute any such action, claim, cause of action or
suit other than before one of the above-named courts, nor to make any motion
or take any

 



95

    

 other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or removal of any
such action, claim, cause of action or suit to any court other than one of the
above-named courts, whether on the grounds of inconvenient forum or
otherwise. Each Party hereby consents to service of process in any such
proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware law, and further consents to
service of process by nationally recognized overnight courier
service guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.9_, any Party
may commence any action, claim, cause of action or suit in a court other than
the above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or
judgment issued by one of the above-named courts.

 

(b) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED,
EACH OF THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-
PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR
COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EACH
OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS, AND
FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE IS ONE IN
WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH LEGAL
DISPUTE A NON-COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE CONSUMMATION OF THE
TRANSACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A
THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LEGAL DISPUTE WITH
A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE
WAIVED.

11.10 _Independent Counsel_. Each of the Parties agrees that it has been
represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and each Party hereto and its counsel cooperated
in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred
to herein and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

 

11.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or
the Sponsor Support Agreement, whether or not the Transactions are
consummated, each Party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in
anticipation of, relating to and in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements and the
consummation of the Transactions.

11.12 _Assignment_. No Party may assign, directly or indirectly, including by
operation of law, either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of a claim for intentional fraud in
the making of the representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _ IV_,
Parent may assign its rights hereunder to the insurer of the RandW Insurance
Policy. Subject to the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



96

    

11.13 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties.

11.14 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent (on
behalf of itself, First Merger Sub and Second Merger Sub), on the one hand,
and the Company (on behalf of itself and the Company Stockholders), on the
other hand, may, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable
Legal Requirements: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to the other Party contained herein or
in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right. In the event any provision of any of the
other Transaction Agreement in any way conflicts with the provisions of this
Agreement (except where a provision therein expressly provides that it is
intended to take precedence over this Agreement), this Agreement shall
control.

 

11.15 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Legal
Proceeding for breach of this Agreement may only be made against, the entities
that are expressly identified herein as Parties to this Agreement, and no
Related Party of a Party shall have any liability for any liabilities
or obligations of the Parties for any Legal Proceeding (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. No Party
shall have any right of recovery in respect hereof against any Related Party
of a Party and no personal liability shall attach to any Related Party of a
Party through such Party, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by the enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty or by
virtue of any Legal Requirement or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 11.15_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by the
Related Parties of the Parties and each such Person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_. This _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Parties. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ shall not
apply to _Section_ __ _ 11.1_, which shall be enforceable by the Stockholder
Representative in its entirety against the Company Stockholders.

 

11.16 _Legal Representation_. Parent hereby agrees on behalf of its directors,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates (including after the
Closing, the Company), and each of their respective successors and assigns
(all such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP
(or any successor) may represent the Company Stockholders or any of their
respective directors, members, partners, officers, employees or Affiliates
(other than the Company) (collectively, the "Waiving Group"), in each case, in
connection with any Legal Proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or the Transactions,
notwithstanding its representation (or any continued representation) of the
Group Companies or other Waiving Parties, and each of Parent and the Company
on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and
irrevocably waives (and will not

 



97

    

 assert) any conflict of interest, breach of duty or any other objection
arising therefrom or relating thereto. Parent and the Company acknowledge that
the foregoing provision applies whether or not Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP
provides legal services to any Group Companies after the Closing Date. Each of
Parent and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby further
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all privileged documents, materials
and communications, written or oral, between, from or among any Group
Companies or any member of the Waiving Group and its counsel, including
Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, or any privilege attaching as a result of
Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP representing the Company or any member of the
Waiving Group, made in connection with or related to the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute or
Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, or any matter relating to any of
the foregoing, do not pass to or remain with the Company notwithstanding the
Mergers, and instead survive, are assigned to, remain with and are controlled
by the Waiving Group (the "Privileged Communications"), without any waiver
thereof. Parent and the Company, together with any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no Person may use
or rely on any of the Privileged Communications, whether located in the
records or email server of the Company or otherwise (including in the
knowledge or the officers and employees of the Company), in any
Legal Proceeding against or involving any of the Parties after the Closing,
and Parent and the Company agree not to assert that any privilege has been
waived as to the Privileged Communications, whether located in the records or
email server of the Company or otherwise (including in the knowledge of the
officers and employees of the Company). Each of the Parties hereto agrees to
take all steps necessary to ensure that any such privilege shall survive the
Closing, remain in effect and be assigned to and controlled by the Waiving
Group.

11.17 _Disclosure Letters and Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall each be arranged in separate parts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained
in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in any numbered or lettered
part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only the particular
representation or warranty set forth in the corresponding numbered or lettered
Section or subsection of this Agreement, except to the extent that: (a) such
information is cross-referenced in another part of the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable; or (b) it is reasonably
apparent on the face of the disclosure (without reference to any document
referred to therein or any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter disclosed) that such information qualifies another
representation and warranty of the Company or Parent, as applicable, in this
Agreement. Certain information set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Parent Disclosure Letter is or may be included solely for
informational purposes, is not an admission of liability with respect to the
matters covered by the information, and may not be required to be disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower
amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter in any dispute
or controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item, or
matter not described herein or included in Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
