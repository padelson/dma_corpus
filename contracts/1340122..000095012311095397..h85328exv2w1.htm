All such other liabilities and obligations shall be retained by and remain liabilities and obligations of Seller and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable (all such liabilities and obligations not being assumed being herein referred to as the "Excluded Liabilities").

 Section 2.05 _. Non-assignability of Purchased Assets._ (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if and to the extent that the transfer or assignment from Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to Buyer of any Purchased Asset would be a violation of Applicable Law with respect to such Purchased Asset or otherwise materially and adversely affect the rights of Seller or its Subsidiaries or Buyer thereunder as a result of the failure to obtain any consent, approval, waiver or authorization required in connection with such transfer or assignment, then the transfer or assignment to Buyer of such Purchased Asset (each, a "Delayed Transfer Asset") shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed and/or applicable consents, approvals, waivers or authorizations have been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes 

   ##### 

  

 

of determining whether any liability or obligation is an Assumed Liability,
any such Delayed Transfer Asset shall be deemed a Purchased Asset only as of
and from the earlier of (i) the date that such Delayed Transfer Asset is
actually transferred or assigned to Buyer and (ii) the date that a Sharing
Arrangement is entered into by Buyer and Seller with respect to such
Delayed Transfer Asset; _provided_ that to the extent Buyer receives the use
or benefit of a given Delayed Transfer Asset, it shall bear the burden of
such Delayed Transfer Asset corresponding to such use or benefit. Seller and
Buyer will use their commercially reasonable efforts (but without any payment
of money by Seller or Buyer) to obtain the consent of the applicable third
party for the assignment or transfer of the Delayed Transfer Assets. 

   

 (b) If the transfer or assignment of any Purchased Asset intended to be transferred or assigned hereunder is not consummated prior to or at the Closing as a result of Section 2.05(a), then Seller or its Subsidiary shall thereafter, directly or indirectly, hold such Delayed Transfer Asset for the use and benefit of Buyer (at the expense of Buyer) insofar as reasonably practicable. In addition, to the extent not prohibited, Seller shall take or cause to be taken such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (including entry into such cooperative arrangements as may be reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller, including sublease, agency, management, indemnity or payment arrangements (a "Sharing Arrangement")) in order to place Buyer, insofar as reasonably practicable, in substantially the same position as if such Delayed Transfer Asset had been transferred as contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Delayed Transfer Asset, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Delayed Transfer Asset, are to inure from and after the Closing to Buyer. To the extent permitted and to the extent otherwise permissible in light of any required consent, approval, waiver or authorization, Buyer shall be entitled to, and shall be responsible for, the management of any Delayed Transfer Assets not yet transferred to it as a result of this Section 2.05 and the parties hereto agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and coordinate with respect thereto. 

  

 (c) If and when the consents, approvals, waivers or authorizations, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Purchased Asset pursuant to this Section 2.05, are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Delayed Transfer Asset to Buyer shall automatically and without further action be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants set forth in this Section 2.05 apply pre-Closing and post-Closing. 

  

 (d) Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated, in connection with the provisions of this Section 2.05, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced by Buyer, other than reasonable out-of-pocket recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by Buyer except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement. 

  

 (e) The parties hereto further agree that, provided that Seller or its 

   ##### 

  

 

Subsidiary and Buyer have entered into a Sharing Arrangement with respect to a
Delayed Transfer Asset or to the extent that Buyer otherwise receives the use
or benefit of a Delayed Transfer Asset, (i) such Delayed Transfer Asset shall
be treated for all income Tax purposes as an asset of Buyer and (ii) neither
Buyer nor Seller shall take, and each of Buyer and Seller shall prevent any
of their respective Affiliates from taking, any position inconsistent with
such treatment for any income Tax purposes (unless required by a change in
applicable income Tax law or a good faith resolution of a contest). 

   

 Section 2.06 _. Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price._ (a) The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Purchased Assets shall be the sum of (i) the Adjusted Cash Amount, (ii) the Inventory Value and (iii) the Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount. The Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.07 and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 2.08, 2.09 and 2.10. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation Statement"), allocating the Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (the "Allocation"). If within 30 days after the delivery of the Allocation Statement Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 30 days. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within 30 days Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain a nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accounting Referee") to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. 

  

 (c) Seller and Buyer agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement and (ii) act in accordance with the Allocation in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return (including filing Form 8594 with its federal income Tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing). 

  

 (d) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.08 or, after the Closing, Section 2.08, Section 2.09, Section 2.10 or Section 12.02, the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. In the event that an agreement is not reached within 30 days after the determination of the applicable adjustment, any disputed items shall be resolved in the manner described in Section 2.06(b). Buyer and Seller agree to file any additional information return required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and to treat the Allocation Statement as adjusted in the manner described in Section 2.06(b). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Not later than 30 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594 relating to this transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its Form 8594. 

  

 (f) No later than 20 Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a proposed schedule (the "Proposed Wisconsin Tax Schedule") that, for purposes of computing the amount of "real estate transfer fees" required by the state of Wisconsin to be paid on the sale of the Purchased Assets (the "Wisconsin Real Estate Transfer Fees"), sets forth either (i) the percentage of the Purchase Price that will be allocated to those Purchased Assets constituting "real property" as defined under the laws of the state of Wisconsin or (ii) a methodology for determining such percentage. Buyer and Seller shall work in good faith to reach agreement on any revisions to the Proposed Wisconsin Tax Schedule and to finalize the revised Proposed Wisconsin Tax Schedule (such final schedule, the "Wisconsin Tax Schedule") no later than 10 Business Days prior to Closing. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach an agreement 10 Business Days prior to Closing, then Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an Accounting Referee to resolve the dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.11. The Accounting Referee shall make a final determination as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 10 days before payment of the real estate transfer fees described in the Wisconsin Tax Schedule are due pursuant to Applicable Law. Upon resolution of the dispute, the percentage or methodology (as applicable) set forth in the Wisconsin Tax Schedule shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution, and Buyer and Seller agree to be bound by such adjusted Wisconsin Tax Schedule. Adjustments to the Wisconsin Real Estate Transfer Fees shall be made in accordance with this Section 2.06(f) following any post-Closing adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.08, Section 2.09 or Section 2.10. 

  

 Section 2.07 _. Closing._ The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, as soon as possible, but in no event later than the second Business Day, after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 11 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be (and will be) satisfied at Closing) or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree; _provided, however,_ that if pursuant to the foregoing the Closing would occur on a date that is earlier than 30 days after the date Seller delivers the Interim Financial Statements to Buyer, then the Closing shall occur on the earlier of (i) the date that is 30 days (or if such date is not a Business Day, on the first Business Day after the end of such 30 day period) after the date on which Seller delivers the Interim Financial Statements to Buyer and (ii) the first Business Day after the day on which Buyer consummates the Financing. The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of 11:59:59 p.m. Central time on the Closing Date. At the Closing: 

  

 (a) Buyer shall deliver to Seller (and/or one or more Subsidiaries of Seller as directed by Seller) an amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the Cash 

   ##### 

  

 

Amount as adjusted by the Estimated Closing Proration Adjustment Amount, (ii)
the Estimated Inventory Value, (iii) Sellers good faith estimate of the
Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount (the "Estimated Aggregate Capital
Expenditures Amount") (which good faith estimate will be delivered by Seller
to Buyer no later than 5 Business Days prior to Closing) and (iv)
if applicable, the Initial Hydrocarbon Inventory Tax Amount, in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to such account(s) of Seller and/or its
Subsidiaries as designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, not later than 2
Business Days prior to the Closing Date (or if not so designated, then
by certified or official bank check payable in immediately available funds to
the order of Seller and/or the applicable Subsidiaries in such amount). 

   

 (b) Seller and/or its Subsidiaries and Buyer shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement and Bill of Sale substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer duly executed special warranty deed(s) substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G and, subject to the provisions hereof, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer such other deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, consents, assignments and other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and assignment as the parties and their respective counsel shall deem reasonably necessary to vest in Buyer all of Sellers and its Subsidiaries right, title and interest in, to and under the Purchased Assets (it being expressly understood that such deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, consents, assignments and other instruments shall not require Seller or its Subsidiaries or any other Person to make any additional representations, warranties or covenants, express or implied, not contained in this Agreement). 

  

 (c) Seller (and/or its applicable Subsidiaries) and Buyer shall enter into (i) the Transition Services Agreement and (ii) the Crude Supply Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.08 _. Hydrocarbon Inventory and Adjustment._ (a) No later than 5 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate of Seller setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of the Inventory Value (the "Estimated Inventory Value"). Such certificate shall also set forth Sellers estimates of the ownership, types, characteristics and volumes, on a tank, trunk, pipeline or other location basis, of all Hydrocarbon Inventory. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall engage a mutually agreeable independent inspector (the "Field Inspector"). The Field Inspector shall measure the Hydrocarbon Inventory as of Closing at the respective locations of the Hydrocarbon Inventory on the Closing Date; _provided_  that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) the volumes of all Hydrocarbon Inventory in process units and pipeworks and the volumes of all tank sludge Hydrocarbon Inventory shall be conclusively determined as set forth on Exhibit B-1 and shall not be measured by the Field Inspector or included in the Field Inspector Report, (ii) the volumes of all In Bound Hydrocarbon Inventory and Outbound Hydrocarbon Inventory (as each such term is defined on Exhibit B-1) (together, 

   ##### 

  

 

"In Bound / Out Bound Inventory") shall be determined as set forth on Exhibit
B-1 and shall not be measured by the Field Inspector or included in the Field
Inspector Report and (iii) crude tank volume compositions shall be determined
as set forth on Exhibit B-2. With respect to the Hydrocarbon Inventory
measured by the Field Inspector, such Hydrocarbon Inventory shall be
measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit B-l. Buyer
shall not take or permit to be taken any actions that would reduce the level
of Hydrocarbon Inventory between the time of the Closing and such time that
the Field Inspector completes its measurement procedures unless Buyer and
Seller mutually agree upon adjustments and/or procedures to appropriately
account for any such reduction. The Field Inspector shall issue a written
report (the "Field Inspector Report") to Buyer and Seller within 10 Business
Days after the Closing Date setting forth the volumes and quantities of the
Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Closing (to the extent such Hydrocarbon
Inventory is measured by the Field Inspector in accordance with Exhibit B-1)
and such volumes and quantities shall be deemed to be final and binding on
Buyer and Seller (absent manifest error). The fees and expenses of the Field
Inspector shall be borne equally by Seller and Buyer. 

   

 (c) As promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than 20 days following receipt of the Field Inspector Report, Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Inventory Statement"), together with (where applicable) supporting calculations and information setting forth (i) the volumes and quantities of the In Bound / Out Bound Inventory as of the Closing Date and determined in accordance with Exhibit B-1 and (ii) the value of the Hydrocarbon Inventory (the "Inventory Value") as of the Closing Date, which value shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit B-2. No later than 20 days following its receipt of the Inventory Statement Buyer shall give Seller notice of (i) its acceptance of the Inventory Statement or (ii) specific and reasonably detailed objections to the valuation and/or (to the extent expressly permitted in Exhibit B-1) the volumes set forth in the Inventory Statement (and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all matters set forth in the Inventory Statement that are not objected to). If Buyer fails to give such notice before the end of such 20 day period, the Inventory Statement will be deemed final and binding upon the parties. If Buyer gives such notice to Seller of Buyers objection within such 20 day period, and Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve the issues in dispute within 10 days after delivery of such notice of objection, each of Buyers and Sellers positions on the remaining items in dispute with respect to the computation of the Inventory Value will be submitted to an independent and qualified party mutually selected by the parties (the "Inspector") such as an accounting firm or independent inspector, for final resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.11. 

  

 (d) If the Inventory Value (as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.08) minus the Estimated Inventory Value (such difference, the "Inventory Balance") is greater than zero, Buyer shall pay to Seller, without offset or deduction, an amount equal to the Inventory Balance by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts of Seller or its 

   ##### 

  

 

Subsidiaries as may be designated by Seller. If the amount of the Inventory
Balance is less than zero, then Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Buyer, without offset or deduction, an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Inventory Balance by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of Buyer as may be designated by Buyer. Any
payment pursuant to this Section 2.08(d) shall be made within 5 days after
the Inventory Value has been finally determined and shall bear interest from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect from time to time during the
period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days
elapsed. 

   

 (e) Each party agrees that, following the Closing, it shall not take any actions with respect to the accounting books, records, policies and procedures of itself or its Affiliates that would obstruct or prevent the preparation of the Inventory Statement as provided in this Section 2.08. From the Closing through the final determination of the Inventory Value in accordance with this Section 2.08, Seller and Buyer shall provide one another with reasonable access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, and books and records of the applicable refinery for purposes of determining the Inventory Value, including permitting the parties and their respective advisors to participate in the taking of the physical inventory. 

  

 (f) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 2.08 or Section 2.11, Buyer and Seller shall each bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and review of the Inventory Statement. 

  

 Section 2.09 _. Adjustments for Pro-Rated Expenses._ (a) Buyer and Seller agree that the items listed in Section 2.09(a)(i)  2.09(a)(vii) (but excluding any income Taxes and the City of Superior Fee, and without duplication) and relating to the Business or operation of the Purchased Assets shall be prorated as of the Closing, with the Seller liable to the extent such items relate to any time period prior to the Closing, and the Buyer liable to the extent such items relate to periods on (including those items arising as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or after the Closing (in each case, measured in the same units used to compute the item in question, or otherwise measured by calendar days), and, in accordance with Section 2.09(b), the Cash Amount shall be increased by the amount of Petty Cash and by the pro-rated amount of all such payments made by Seller and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing but that are attributable to periods on or after the Closing and the Cash Amount shall be decreased by the pro-rated amount of all such payments to be made by Buyer subsequent to the Closing but that are attributable to periods prior to the Closing: 

   

 (i) personal property, real estate and occupancy Taxes, assessments and other charges, including those of the type that could give 

   ##### 

  

   

rise to a Permitted Lien or are payable in installments of which any
installment is due and payable, if any, on or with respect to the Business or
operation of the Purchased Assets; _provided_ that the proration of Taxes
referred to in this Section 2.09(a)(i) shall be made in accordance with
Article 8; 

   

 (ii) rent, Taxes and all other items (including prepaid services or goods not included in Hydrocarbon Inventory) payable by or to the Seller or its Subsidiaries under any Assigned Contracts; 

   

 (iii) any permit fees, license fees, registration fees or other similar fees with respect to any Business Permits; 

   

 (iv) sewer rents and charges for water, telephone, electricity and other utilities; 

   

 (v) other fees or charges imposed by any Governmental Authority; 

   

 (vi) the Prepayments (other than those set forth on Section 2.09(a)(vi) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule), it being understood that for purposes of this Section 2.09(a)(vi), any deposit or similar payment securing a performance obligation will be deemed to be a Prepayment that relates to periods after the Closing Date regardless of actual timing of the performance obligation; and 

   

 (vii) payments under the Assigned Contracts; _provided_ that if Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any of its Affiliates makes any payment to a third party pursuant to any Assigned Contract and (i) such payment is made in respect of work performed, services provided or goods delivered during a period of time that includes the Closing or (ii) the Closing occurs between the making of such payment and the performance of the work or services or delivery of goods, the parties will allocate the burden of such payment in a manner that reflects the relative benefit of such work performed, services provided or goods delivered to each party. 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that for purposes of determining
the pro-rations pursuant to this Section 2.09(a), the Closing Date will be
included in the time period for which Seller is responsible, except to the
extent the relevant matter arises as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) At Closing, the Cash Amount shall be increased or decreased (as applicable) by an amount equal to Sellers good faith estimate of the amount of Petty Cash and the prorations referred to in Section 2.09(a) (such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Proration Adjustment Amount"), and a further adjustment to account for the difference between the estimated amounts and the actual amounts (the "Post-Closing Proration Adjustment Amount") shall be made 

   ##### 

  

 

after the Closing by mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer within 45 days
after the Closing Date (or 120 days of the Closing Date, in the case of
prorations referred to in Section 2.09(a)(i)) and no further adjustment
payment in respect of Petty Cash and such prorations shall be made thereafter.
The prorations relating to a time period shall be based on the number of days
in a year or other appropriate period (a) through and including the Closing
Date and (b) after the Closing Date. The Seller and the Buyer agree to
furnish each other with such documents and other records as may be reasonably
requested in order to confirm all adjustment and proration calculations made
pursuant to Section 2.09(a) and this Section 2.09(b). If Seller and Buyer are
not able to mutually agree on a Post-Closing Proration Adjustment Amount
within the period specified above, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an
Accounting Referee to resolve the dispute in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.11. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Section
2.09(b) shall be made within 5 days after the Post-Closing Proration
Adjustment Amount has been finally determined, whether by mutual agreement or
dispute resolution (the "Post-Closing Adjustment Date"), and shall bear
interest from and including the Post-Closing Adjustment Date to but excluding
the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect
from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of
payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to
which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365
days and the actual number of days elapsed. 

   

 Section 2.10 _. Adjustments For Certain Capital Expenditures._ (a) Promptly following the Closing, but in no event later than 45 days thereafter, Seller shall provide Buyer with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount, which statement shall be accompanied by copies of the applicable vendor invoices for the expenses shown to the extent available, and such other supporting documentation as Buyer reasonably requests; it being understood that Seller shall be responsible for all payments owing to vendors for all capital expenditures reflected in such statement. Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with the amount set forth on such statement unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing of its disagreement within 20 days of Buyers receipt of such statement. If Buyer so notifies Seller, Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any such disagreement as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 10 days of such notification. If Seller and Buyer are not able to mutually agree on a determination of the Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount within the period specified above, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an Accounting Referee to resolve the dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.11. If the Final Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount exceeds the Estimated Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount, Buyer shall pay promptly to Seller, without offset or deduction, the amount of such excess to such account or accounts as may be designated by Seller. If the Estimated Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount exceeds the Final Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer, without offset or deduction, the amount of such excess to such account or accounts as may be designated by Buyer. As used herein, "Final Aggregate Capital Expenditures 

   ##### 

  

 

Amount" means the amount set forth on the statement delivered by Seller
pursuant to this Section 2.10 (if Buyer does not notify Seller of a
disagreement as set forth herein) or the Aggregate Capital
Expenditures Amount that has been finally determined, whether by mutual
agreement or dispute resolution. 

   

 (b) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be made within 5 days after the Final Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount has been determined and shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed. 

  

 Section 2.11. _Dispute Resolution_. 

  

 (a) In the case of any dispute submitted to an Accounting Referee or an Inspector pursuant to this Agreement, (i) the Inspector or Accounting Referee, as applicable, shall only consider those items as to which Buyer and Seller disagree, (ii) each party will furnish to the Inspector or Accounting Referee, as applicable, such work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Inspector or Accounting Referee, as applicable, may request and are available to such party, and will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Inspector or Accounting Referee, as applicable, any material relating to such issues and to discuss the same with the Inspector or Accounting Referee, as applicable, (iii) the Inspectors or Accounting Referees determination or computation of the applicable final amount or value shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and will be deemed to be final (provided that with respect to each item in dispute, the Inspectors or Accounting Referees determination or computation of the applicable final amount or value shall be within the bounds of the applicable amount or value submitted by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, with respect to such item) and judgment thereupon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which the same is sought to be enforced and (iv) the fees and expenses of the Inspector or Accounting Referee, as applicable, for such determination will be borne by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the dollar amount of disputed items lost by the Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, bears to the total dollar amount in dispute that is resolved by the Inspector or Accounting Referee, as applicable.

   ##### 

  

 

Seller (or any of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for
additional information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor
in good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and
after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such
request. No party shall participate in any meeting, or engage in any material
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority without giving the
other party prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend
or participate. Buyer shall advise Seller promptly of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Buyer proposes to make or
enter into with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt
and irrespective of whether the sale of the Business occurs, Buyer shall not
require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to, and neither Seller nor any of

Order or any applicable Law which would bind Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (d) Seller and Buyer agree to execute and deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to vest in Buyer good and (to the extent applicable) marketable title to the Purchased Assets;  _provided_ that such documents, certificates, agreements, other writings or actions shall not require Seller or its Subsidiaries or any other Person to make any additional representations, warranties or covenants, express or implied, not contained in this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.02 _.

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7.04 _. Post-Closing Payments or Demands._ Should Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, after Closing, receive payments to which the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, then the Seller or its applicable Subsidiaries shall, within 30 days of receipt of the same, forward such payments to Buyer, and should Buyer or any of its Affiliates, after Closing, receive payments to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled pursuant to this Agreement, then Buyer or its applicable Affiliates, within 30 days of receipt of the same, shall forward such payments to, or as directed by, Seller. If any demand is made on Buyer or its Affiliates after Closing to pay any invoice or other obligation contracted or incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries prior to Closing in the operation of the Business, Buyer or its Affiliates shall pay the same to the extent such invoice or obligation constitutes an Assumed Liability; if and to the extent any such invoice or obligation constitutes an Excluded Liability, Seller shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, pay the same.

At least 15 Business Days prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller a full proposal from the relevant insurance carrier for the Environmental Insurance Policy, including all endorsements and policy forms. 

   

 (ii) From and after Closing, Buyer shall comply, and shall cause its Affiliates to comply, with the terms and conditions of the Environmental Insurance Policy, including those relating to reporting, cooperation and defense of claims, and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such policy in force and to not allow such policy to be cancelled or otherwise modified in any manner that would prejudice Seller. 

   

 (iii) In connection with obtaining the Environmental Insurance Policy, Buyer shall provide to the relevant insurance carrier all documentation and other information reasonably requested to be disclosed in the application for such policy. Seller shall use reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in providing such documentation and other information.

   ##### 

  

 

Decree and been provided with a copy thereof; and (ii) within a reasonable
time after the date hereof (but in any event within 5 days of the date
hereof), Seller or its Subsidiaries shall provide notice of this Agreement to
the other parties to the Consent Decree. Seller or its Subsidiaries and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to make any changes to the Consent
Decree Modification mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer that are (A)
appropriate non-substantive form changes or (B) if applicable, necessary to
reflect only the sale that is the subject of this Agreement and not the sale
of that certain refinery in Meraux, Louisiana. Seller or its Subsidiaries and
Buyer shall consult with the parties to the Consent Decree to confirm that
those parties have no objections to the Consent Decree Modification and, if
applicable, shall negotiate in good faith with such parties to resolve any
such objections. Upon obtaining such confirmation or making any changes
mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer to address any objections by
the parties to the Consent Decree, Seller shall take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate actions (including those set forth in Paragraph 7 of the
Consent Decree) to have the Consent Decree Modification entered by the
Consent Decree Court, and Buyer shall take all reasonable steps (including
those set forth in paragraph 7 of the Consent Decree) to support Sellers or
its Subsidiaries actions to have the Consent Decree Modification entered by
the Consent Decree Court, including supporting Sellers and its Subsidiaries
efforts to be released from the Consent Decree Obligations and to demonstrate
to the Consent Decree Court and the other parties to the Consent Decree that
Buyer has the financial and technical ability to assume the Consent Decree
Obligations. On and after the Closing, Buyer shall satisfy, perform and
assume all Consent Decree Obligations. 

   

 (c) _Fuels Compliance_. 

   

 (i) From and after Closing, (i) for fuels shipped on and after Closing, Buyer shall be responsible for all Fuel Compliance Obligations and (ii) for fuels shipped prior to Closing, Seller shall be responsible for all Fuel Compliance Obligations (such obligations of Seller, "Pre-Closing Fuel Compliance Obligations"). Seller or its Subsidiaries shall submit by the relevant deadline all filings required by the Fuel Regulations associated solely with the Pre-Closing Fuel Compliance Obligations, and shall provide a copy, or other such proof, of each such filing to Buyer. 

   

 (ii) In the event either party (the "Complying Party") may be required by applicable Fuel Regulations to use Fuel Credits to comply with any Fuel Compliance Obligations that, as set forth in Section 7.05(c)(i), are the responsibility of the other party (the "Obligated Party"), prior to using such credits, the Complying Party shall use reasonable efforts to allow the Obligated Party to provide it with Fuel Credits that satisfy, in whole or in part, such Fuel Compliance Obligations. To the extent the Obligated Partys Fuel Compliance Obligations are not satisfied in whole by Fuel Credits provided by the Obligated Party, the Obligated Party shall reimburse the Complying Party for the cost of any Fuel Credits the Complying Party used to satisfy such Fuel Compliance 

   ##### 

  

   

Obligations (at the Obligated Partys election, either in the form of Fuel
Credits or the monetary equivalent in U.S. dollars (which cost, in the case
of Fuel Credits used by the Complying Party which it already owns, shall be
at the fair market value of such Fuel Credits)), provided the Complying Party
submits to the Obligated Party a written request for reimbursement with
sufficient supporting evidence of having used such Fuel Credits and the value
thereof. 

   

 (iii) In the event Buyer, at any time prior to the earlier of (A) the completion and entry into operation of the cumene project described on Section 1.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (B) December 31, 2011, notifies Seller that it is required by applicable Fuel Regulations to use Fuel Credits to comply with any Fuel Compliance Obligations that, as set forth in Section 7.05(c)(i), are Buyers responsibility, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer such Fuel Credits as Buyer may reasonably require in order to satisfy, in whole or in part, such Fuel Compliance Obligations which arise from operations in the Ordinary Course of Business at a cost for such Fuel Credits equal to the fair market monetary equivalent at the time of such sale in U.S. dollars; _provided_ that Seller shall not have any obligation to sell Fuel Credits other than those in its possession and not otherwise necessary for its or its Subsidiaries operations or obligations (including any obligation to third parties). Buyer acknowledges that Seller may cause to be sold its Subsidiarys refinery and related assets in Meraux, Louisiana, which may reduce the quantity of Fuel Credits available to Seller. 

  

 Section 7.06 _. Title Policies._ Buyer may procure owners title insurance policies with respect to the Owned Real Property; _provided,_ that Buyers ability or inability to obtain title insurance on such Owned Real Property shall not result in an adjustment to the Purchase Price;  _provided further_ , that the foregoing shall not be deemed to mitigate Sellers representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.10. Seller and its Subsidiaries shall execute and deliver to the title insurance company such affidavits, certificates and other documentation as are reasonably requested to cause the title insurance company to issue title insurance policies for the Owned Real Property; _provided_ that nothing in such affidavits, certificates or documentation shall require Seller or its Subsidiaries to incur any liabilities or obligations to any Person that are not otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. Seller agrees to cooperate with and assist Buyer with any reasonable request in Buyers efforts to obtain such title policies. 

  

 Section 7.07 _. Litigation Cooperation._ (a) In connection with the defense or prosecution of any suit, action or proceeding relating to an Assumed Liability or an Excluded Liability (but subject to the provisions of Article 12 in the event indemnification is being sought thereunder pursuant to any applicable provision of this Agreement) each party shall (i) cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of such suit, action or proceeding, (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished such documents, records, 

   ##### 

  

 

information and testimony, grant or cause to be granted access to all

requested in connection therewith, and (iii) take all reasonable steps
to make available to the other party, upon written request, its former and
current employees, other personnel and agents (whether as witnesses or
otherwise) to the extent that such persons may reasonably be required in
connection therewith. 

   

 (b) Neither Seller nor Buyer will (and each of Seller and Buyer shall cause its respective Affiliates not to) destroy or dispose of any documents, records or information that a party may have the right to obtain pursuant to Section 7.07 without first using its reasonable best efforts to notify the other party of the proposed destruction or disposition and giving the other party the opportunity to take possession of or copy such documents, records or information prior to such destruction or disposition. 

  

 Section 7.08 _. Contact with Customers and Vendors._ Without prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, prior to the Closing Date, contact any customer, vendor, supplier or employee of, or any other Person having business dealings with, Seller or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Business or with respect to any aspect of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement;  _provided_ that Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in contacting, prior to the Closing Date, customers and suppliers of the Business as reasonably necessary for the purposes of transferring or establishing credit and related security arrangements.

   ##### 

  

   

as those set forth in such franchisees Seller PMPA Franchise Agreement; 

   

 (ii) use their best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under the PMPA to give effect to the assignment of the Seller PMPA Franchise Agreements to Buyer as set forth in Article 2; 

   

 (iii) at or as promptly as practicable following the Closing (but in any event within 5 Business Days of the Closing Date) provide a PMPA Termination Notice to each franchisee under a Seller PMPA Franchise Agreement in such form as is mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller, and take, or cause to be taken, all actions to terminate or non-renew each Seller PMPA Franchise Agreement as of the applicable PMPA Termination Date in accordance with such PMPA Termination Notices; and 

   

 (iv) use their best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under the PMPA to give effect to take all other actions required under the PMPA to effect the provisions of this Section 7.09. 

  

 (b) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing for 12 months, Buyer shall offer each franchisee under a Seller PMPA Franchise Agreement a new PMPA franchise agreement with Buyer (the form of which shall be included with the PMPA Termination Notice) on substantially the same terms and conditions as those set forth in such franchisees Seller PMPA Franchise Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.10 _. Crude Supply Agreement._ At Closing, Seller (or its Affiliate) and Buyer will enter into a crude supply agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "Crude Supply Agreement"). 

  

 Section 7.11 _. Buyer Financing._ Seller acknowledges that Buyer may undertake an equity and/or debt financing (the "Financing"), the proceeds of which may be used to fund all or a portion of the Purchase Price. Seller agrees that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyers efforts to secure the Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Business or Seller or its Subsidiaries), including (a) using commercially reasonable efforts to deliver (i) an unaudited balance sheet for the Business as of June 30, 2011 and the related statement of operations and cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and (ii) the statement of operations and cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2010 (collectively, the "Interim Financial Statements"), (b) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent auditors to deliver customary "comfort letters" in connection with the Financing, which comfort letters shall comply with the requirements of PCAOB AU Section 634 and cover such periods as are addressed by the Business Financial Statements and the Interim Financial 

   ##### 

  

 

Statements and are required under Regulation S-X to be included in a
registration statement for a Financing registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, together with negative assurance for any subsequent
partial period for which the applicable financial information for
the Business is available to the extent such partial period is within 135
days of the date of the latest audited or reviewed financial statements for
the Business, and (c), if requested by Buyer, providing such information to
the underwriters, initial purchasers, lenders or other financing parties in
any such proposed Financing as may be reasonably requested in connection with
such parties due diligence investigation of the Business, including
permitting Buyers lenders or their agents to conduct an on-site evaluation
of the Hydrocarbon Inventory of the Business (provided that any such
evaluation of the Hydrocarbon Inventory shall not have any effect on, and
shall not be used in connection with, the determination of the Inventory
Value or any other matter that is the subject of Section 2.08). Buyer shall
promptly, upon request by Seller from time to time, reimburse Seller for the
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation (including reasonable
attorneys and accountants fees). Notwithstanding anything in this Section
7.11 to the contrary, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (A) be
required to incur any cost or expense in connection with the foregoing unless
Seller is reasonably satisfied that such amount will be promptly reimbursed
by Buyer, (B) have any liability or any obligation under any agreement or
document related to the Financing or (C) be required to incur any other
liability with respect to the Financing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, representatives and advisors from and against any and all
Damages suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent
that such Damages result from or arise out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller or its Subsidiaries. Buyer agrees that (i) all non-
public or other confidential information provided by Seller or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives to Buyer or its
representatives pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with and subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement (except to the extent required to be disclosed under applicable
securities laws in connection with an offering of securities by Buyer; and in
connection therewith Buyer will take such actions as Seller may reasonably
request to limit any such disclosure and/or to protect the
confidentiality thereof), (ii) Seller shall be permitted a reasonable period
(which period will take into account the form and timing of the Financing,
and Buyer will keep Seller reasonably informed on a contemporary basis as to
such form and timing) to comment on those portions of any prospectus
or confidential information memorandum related to the Financing that contain
or are based upon any such non-public or other confidential information (and
Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to respond to such comments in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to Seller), (iii) Seller shall not
be obligated to disclose any information if such disclosure would violate any
agreement between Seller or its Subsidiaries and a third party, (iv) Buyer
will not unreasonably interfere with the 

      ##### 

  

    

operation of Seller or its Subsidiaries business in connection herewith. For
the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the Financing, neither Buyer nor
any of its potential financing sources may, under any circumstances, conduct
or cause to be conducted any sampling or other invasive investigation of the
air, soil, soil gas, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media at any property related to the Seller or its Subsidiaries
or the Business, including the Purchased Assets, the Facilities and the Real
Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that (i) the Closing is not conditioned upon consummating any
Financing or the receipt by Buyer of any funds necessary to pay the Purchase
Price and (ii) the failure of Buyer to consummate any Financing shall not
alter or modify Buyers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Closing). 

   

 Section 7.12 _. Certain Agreements._ On or as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, each of Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver the agreement described in Item 1(a) of Section 5.01(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (subject to such modifications as may be mutually agreed by the parties thereto). 

  

 Section 7.13 _. Software License Assistance._ From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist ( _e.g._ , by participating in phone calls with vendors) Buyer in Buyers obtaining licenses for the software listed in Item D of Section 3.04(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that (i) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to pay any costs or expenses (including transfer or license fees, which shall be solely for the account of Buyer) in connection with the foregoing and (ii) any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the foregoing shall be promptly reimbursed by Buyer. 

  

ARTICLE 8 
 Tax Matters 

   

 Section 8.01 _. Tax Cooperation; Allocation of Taxes._ (a) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Purchased Assets until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, taking into account any extensions that have been granted. On or after the end of such period, each party shall provide the other with at least 30 days prior written notice before destroying any such books and records, during which period the party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes 

   ##### 

  

 

involving the Purchased Assets or the Business. 

   

 (b) All real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar _ad valorem_ obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a taxable period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period after the Closing Date (any such portion of such taxable period, the "Post-Closing Tax Period"). Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period. 

  

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be liable for the City of Superior Occupational Tax on Petroleum Products Refined in Wisconsin (the "City of Superior Fee") that is properly allocable to Sellers operations in Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Buyer shall be liable for the City of Superior Fee properly allocable to Buyers operations in Post-Closing Tax Periods. 

  

 (d) Through the Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible for filing with the taxing authorities the applicable Tax returns for _ad valorem_ , property, severance, production and similar Taxes which are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for the filing with the appropriate taxing authorities the applicable Tax returns for all _ad valorem_ , property, severance, production and similar Taxes beginning after the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) All excise, value added, registration stamp, recording, documentary, conveyancing and Wisconsin Real Estate Transfer Fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller other than Transfer Taxes imposed on the sale of the Hydrocarbon Inventory. All state and local sales and use taxes ("Sales and Use Taxes") imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Transfer Taxes imposed on the sale of the Hydrocarbon Inventory shall be borne solely and exclusively by Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in securing and providing each other with any appropriate resale exemption certifications, licenses and other similar documentation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no later than 5 Business Days prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller either (i) each of the items set forth in Section 8.01(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (ii) in the case of any such item that has not yet been obtained, documentation that establishes to Sellers satisfaction that Buyer has completed the necessary filings in order to secure an effective date for such item that is no later than the Closing Date (the "Filing Documentation"). In any case in which, as of the Closing Date, Buyer has not delivered to Seller either any item set forth in Section 8.01(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the corresponding Filing Documentation, Buyer shall pay to Seller at Closing an amount equal to the Transfer Taxes and 

   ##### 

  

 

Sales and Use Taxes that Seller expects to be imposed on the sale of the
Hydrocarbon Inventory (the "Initial Hydrocarbon Inventory Tax Amount"), with
the amount of such payment to be determined as follows: (i) the portion of
the Initial Hydrocarbon Inventory Tax Amount comprising Transfer Taxes shall
be the amount of Transfer Taxes Seller expects will be imposed on the
estimated volume of the Hydrocarbon Inventory and (ii) the portion comprising
Sales and Use Taxes shall be the amount of Sales and Use Taxes Seller expects
will be imposed on the Estimated Inventory Value, each as determined pursuant
to Section 2.08. If, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.08(c),
it is determined that the estimated volume of the Hydrocarbon Inventory is
more or less than the volume of the Hydrocarbon Inventory as of the Closing
Date and/or the Estimated Inventory Value is more or less than the Inventory
Value, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of any resulting net increase
in the aggregate Transfer Taxes and Sales and Use Taxes imposed on the
sale of the Hydrocarbon Inventory at Closing or, as applicable, (ii) Seller
shall pay to Buyer the amount of any resulting net overpayment of the
aggregate Transfer Taxes and Sales and Use Taxes imposed on the sale of the
Hydrocarbon Inventory at Closing, in each case at the same time and subject
to the same interest provisions as the amounts described in Section 2.08(d).
In addition, within 10 days of receipt by Seller of any refund in respect of
(i) the Initial Hydrocarbon Inventory Tax Amount and (ii) any additional
amounts actually paid by Buyer pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding
sentence, Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount of such refund. Buyer and
Seller agree that the amount of Wisconsin Real Estate Transfer Fees shall be
determined in accordance with Section 2.06(f) and apportioned as provided in
this Section 8.01(e). Any subsequent adjustments to any Transfer Tax or Sales
and Use Tax made pursuant to a legally prescribed audit, and any
costs incurred with respect to such audit, shall be apportioned as provided
in this Section 8.01(e). 

   

 (f) Apportioned Obligations and Taxes described in Section 8.01(e) shall be timely paid, and all applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed, as provided by Applicable Law. Upon payment of any such Apportioned Obligation or Tax described in Section 8.01(e), the paying party shall present a statement to the non-paying party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled under Section 8.01(b) or Section 8.01(e), as the case may be together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later than 10 days after the presentation of such statement. Any payment not made within such time shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Interest Rate for each day until paid. 

  

 (g) For the avoidance of doubt, this Article 8 shall not apply to any Taxes or fees that are taken into account in the calculation of the Inventory Value pursuant to Section 2.08, all of which shall be paid by Buyer pursuant to the calculation of the Inventory Value.

In addition, Buyer agrees that during the Relevant Period, it shall provide (or cause its Affiliates to provide) Non-Union Transferred Employees with benefits that are at least comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided by Seller to Non-Union Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing (including, for such purpose, severance benefits and excluding, for such purpose, (A) retirement and other benefits under any defined benefit pension plan (including, without limitation, the Seller DB Plan (as defined below)), (B) any 

   ##### 

  

 

benefits under any retiree medical or welfare benefits plan, (C) any benefits
under any equity based plan (including, without limitation, the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan for Murphy Oil Corporation, the Murphy Oil Corporation
Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Murphy Oil Corporation 1992 Stock Incentive
Plan), and (D) any stay or similar bonuses). Buyer agrees that after
the expiration of the Relevant Period, it shall provide (or cause its
Affiliates to provide) Non-Union Transferred Employees with compensation and
benefits that are at least comparable in the aggregate to the compensation

Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer DC Plan to provide for a supplemental employer profit sharing contribution (the "Profit Sharing Contribution") to be allocated to each Non-Union Transferred Employee who is a participant in the Buyer DC Plan (a "Non-Union Transferred Participant").

Seller agrees to cooperate and provide such information as is necessary for Buyer to provide such coverage to the Union Transferred Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, the Union Welfare Plans assumed by Buyer shall not include the provision of retiree medical or other retiree benefits.

therein. 

   

 (b) Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other provisions of this Article 12, Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective successors and assigns, and each of their respective directors and officers (or Persons in a similar capacity) and employees (each, a "Seller Indemnified Party") against, and agrees to defend and hold each of them harmless from, any and all Damages imposed upon or actually incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party to the extent such Damages are in connection with, resulting from or arising out of: 

   

 (i) any Warranty Breach or breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 11.03(a)(iii);

 (c) Buyer and Seller agree that any payments made pursuant to this Section 12.02 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 12.03 _. Third Party Claim Procedures._ (a) The party seeking indemnification under this Article 12 (or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides for indemnification) (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party ("Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article or such other provision of this Agreement. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim, including the amount thereof (estimated, if necessary, and if then estimable), and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 12.03, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its own expense. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.03, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party and its affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall not enter into any settlement of such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party. 

  

 (d) In connection with the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim, each party shall (i) cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to 

   ##### 

  

 

cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of such claim, (ii) furnish or cause
to be furnished such documents, records, information and testimony, grant or
cause to be granted access to all reasonably requested witnesses, and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, in each
case as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith, and (iii) take
all reasonable steps to make available to the other party, upon written
request, its former and current employees, other personnel and agents
(whether as witnesses or otherwise) to the extent that such persons may
reasonably be required in connection therewith. Neither Seller nor Buyer will
(and each of Seller and Buyer shall cause its respective Affiliates not to)
destroy or dispose of any documents, records or information related to the
defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim without first using its
reasonable best efforts to notify the other party of the proposed destruction
or disposition and giving the other party the opportunity to take possession
of or copy such documents, records or information prior to such destruction
or disposition. 

   

 Section 12.04 _. Direct Claim Procedures._ In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under this Article 12 (or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides for indemnification) against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim, including the amount thereof (estimated, if necessary, and if then estimable), and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 Section 12.05 _. Calculation of Damages._ (a) The amount of any Damages payable under this Article 12 (or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides for indemnification) by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies (including the Environmental Insurance Policy), or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor and the present value of any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. The present value of any such Tax benefit shall be computed (x) using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable federal rate in effect at the time the relevant payment is made, (y) assuming that the Tax benefit will be used at the earliest date or dates allowable by Applicable Law and (z) using the maximum federal or state, as the case may be, corporate Tax rate in effect at the time the relevant payment is made. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies (including the Environmental Insurance Policy), or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Agreement for any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that the Indemnified Party had been compensated for such matter pursuant to the adjustments under Sections 2.08 or 2.09, (ii) consequential, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or punitive Damages or (iii) Damages for lost profits or opportunities. 

  

 (c) Each Indemnified Party must use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation within 5 Business Days after the benefit is received. 

  

 (d) Each Indemnified Party shall use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage (including under the Environmental Insurance Policy), or from any other Person potentially responsible, for any Damages payable under this Article 12 (or any other provision of this Agreement that expressly provides for indemnification). 

  

 Section 12.06 _. Environmental Procedures._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 12, with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder for any Assumed Environmental Liability, Excluded Environmental Liability or Warranty Breach of Section 3.16 (Environmental Compliance) or, to the extent relating to Permits required by Environmental Law, Section 3.17 (Permits), or any other claim for indemnification hereunder relating in any way to any Environmental Law or any spill, release, emission, discharge, disposal or recycling of, or exposure to, any Hazardous Material (collectively, "Environmental Matters"), Buyer and Seller agree, in addition to any other relevant provisions set forth in this Article 12 (and in the case of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 12.06 and any other provision in Article 12, the provisions of this Section 12.06 shall apply), as follows: 

  

 (a) The costs of any Remedial Action, which costs are otherwise subject to indemnification hereunder, shall be indemnified only to the extent such costs must be incurred to, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, meet the requirements of any applicable Environmental Law or meet the legally enforceable demands of any applicable Governmental Authority, using, where possible, risk based standards, engineering or institutional controls or deed or other restrictions so long as such standards, controls or restrictions do not materially limit those industrial activities being performed on the applicable property as of Closing. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have no liability under this Agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

for any Damages to the extent (i) arising out of any sampling or other
invasive investigation of the air, soil, soil gas, surface water,
groundwater, building materials or other environmental media or any
disclosure, report or communication to, or initiation or encouragement of any
action by, any Governmental Authority or other third party relating to any
Environmental Matters except to the extent such investigation, sampling,
disclosure, report, communication, initiation or encouragement is required to
be undertaken by an Environmental Law or pursuant to the order or directive
of any Governmental Authority; or (ii) arising in connection with any
construction, renovation, modification, expansion, reconstruction, shutdown,
demolition, financing or closure of any asset, facility or real property at
or after Closing. 

   

 (c) As between Buyer and Seller, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its option to control such Environmental Matter, including the disclosure, investigation, negotiation, performance, remediation, monitoring, settlement and resolution of such matter. With respect to any Environmental Matter, (i) the controlling party shall keep the other party reasonably informed; and (ii) both parties agree to, and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate with the other party in providing reasonable access to properties and facilities and reasonably promptly provide each other with copies of all communications relating to such matter received from or delivered to any Person. 

  

 (d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Environmental Insurance Policy will contain its own procedures, including with respect to notice, cooperation and defense of claims, and that to the extent any of the provisions of this Article 12 conflict with the provisions of such Environmental Insurance Policy with respect to any claim that is submitted pursuant to such policy, the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy shall prevail, _provided, however,_ the terms of such Environmental Insurance Policy shall in no way limit any right to indemnification provided under this Agreement. 

  

 (e) No Indemnifying Party shall have liability under this Agreement for any Damages to the extent such Damages are exacerbated by acts or omissions of or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement for any Damages relating to any Environmental Matters to the extent arising from or relating to the coming into force of, or the change in, any requirement or obligation set forth in any Environmental Law or Permit required by Environmental Law (or the interpretation or enforcement of such Environmental Law or Permit), including any new or modified standard or requirement for Remedial Action, on or after Closing. 

  

 Section 12.07 _. Assignment of Claims._ If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to Section 12.02 and the Indemnified Party potentially could have recovered all or a 

   ##### 

  

 

part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor"), the
Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the
Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to
recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. 

   

 Section 12.08 _. Exclusivity._ Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) waives any rights and claims Buyer and its Affiliates may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective officers, directors or employees, whether in law or in equity, relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the transactions contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, this Article 12 will provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or any breach of any covenant contained in Section 5.01. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement or any documents or certificates delivered in connection with this Agreement shall limit any liability for Fraud and the limitations on liability set forth in Section 12.02(a) and Section 12.02(b) shall not apply to liabilities for Fraud. 

  

ARTICLE 13 
 Termination 

   

 Section 13.01 _. Grounds for Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

  

 (a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; 

  

 (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the six month anniversary of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such date; 

  

 (c) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction; or 

  

 (d) by either party if (i) there has been a violation or breach by the other party of any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement (which has not been waived in writing by the non-breaching party), (ii) such violation or breach is not capable of being cured by the date set forth in Section 

   ##### 

  

 

13.01(b) or, after receipt by the breaching party of a written notice of such
violation or breach by the non-breaching party, the breaching party does not
use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such violation or breach as
promptly as reasonably practicable and (iii) such violation or breach would
result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Article 11 being satisfied
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be (and will be) satisfied
or waived at Closing). 

   

 The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.01(b) or Section 13.01(c) shall give notice of such termination to the other party. 

  

 Section 13.02 _. Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 13.01, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_ that if such termination shall result from the willful and knowing (i) failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by either party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach.
