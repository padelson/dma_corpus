setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount,
which statement shall be accompanied by copies of the applicable vendor invoices for the expenses
shown to the extent available, and such other supporting documentation as Buyer
reasonably requests; it being understood that Seller shall be responsible for all payments owing to
vendors for all capital expenditures reflected in such statement. Buyer shall be deemed to have
agreed with the amount set forth on such statement unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing of its
disagreement within 20&nbsp;days of Buyer&#146;s receipt of such statement. If Buyer so notifies Seller,
Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any such disagreement as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 10&nbsp;days of such notification. If Seller and Buyer are not
able to mutually agree on a determination of the Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount within the
period specified above, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain an Accounting Referee to resolve the
dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;2.11. If the Final Aggregate
Capital Expenditures Amount exceeds the Estimated Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount, Buyer
shall pay promptly to Seller, without offset or deduction, the amount of such excess to such
account or accounts as may be designated by Seller. If the Estimated Aggregate Capital
Expenditures Amount exceeds the Final Aggregate Capital Expenditures Amount, Seller shall promptly
