Period, Sellers' Representative and Sellers' accountants shall have full

request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement
and to prepare a Statement of Objections (defined below); _provided_ that such

(ii)   _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, Sellers' Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital
Statement by delivering to Buyer a written statement setting forth Sellers'
objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and
the basis for Sellers' Representative's disagreement therewith (the
"Statement of Objections"). If Sellers' Representative fails to deliver the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the
Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case
may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement, as applicable,
shall be deemed to have been accepted by all Sellers. If Sellers'
Representative delivers the Statement of Objections before the expiration of
the Review Period, Buyer and Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the
Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so

Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been
previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Sellers' Representative, shall be
final and binding on all parties.

  



  

(iii)   _Resolution of Disputes_. If Sellers' Representative and

so disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to
an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants to be mutually agreed on by Buyer and Sellers' Representative
(the "Independent Accountant") who, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments
to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the Closing Working
Capital Statement, as applicable. The parties hereto agree that all
adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent
Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the
parties as to the Disputed Amount, and the Independent Account's decision for
each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such
item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections,
respectively.

  



  

(iv)   _Fees of the Independent Accountant_. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant shall be paid equally by Sellers, on the one
hand, and by Buyer, on the other hand.

  



  

(v)   _Determination by Independent Accountant_. The Independent
Accountant shall make a determination as soon as practicable and in any event
within 30 days (or such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in
writing) after the Independent Account's engagement, and the Independent
Account's resolution of the Disputed Amounts, Excluded Contract Retainage, and
the Independent Account's adjustments to the Closing Working Capital
Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive and binding
upon the parties hereto.

(c)  Payment of Final Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment as finally and conclusively determined pursuant to this
Section 2.04 (whether by reason of the absence of any objections by Sellers'
Representative or the resolution of any disputes by Buyer and Sellers'
Representative and/or the Independent Accountant) is a positive number, Buyer
shall pay in cash to an account designated in writing by Sellers'
Representative for further payment by Sellers' Representative to Sellers in
accordance with Sellers' applicable Selling Percentages an amount equal to the
Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment as finally and
conclusively determined pursuant to this Section 2.04 (whether by reason of
the absence of any objections by Sellers' Representative or the resolution of
any disputes by Buyer and Sellers' Representative and/or the Independent
Accountant) is a negative number, the Post-Closing Payments (beginning with
the First Deferred Payment) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Post-

(i) all leases of Real Property, including all amendments, extensions,

landlord under the lease, the rental amount currently being paid, and the

Property; and (iv) the current use of such Leased Real Property. With respect
to such Leased Real Property, Sellers have delivered or made available to
Buyer true, complete and correct copies of the Real Property Leases. The
Company is not a sublessor or grantor under any sublease or other instrument
granting to any other Person any right to the possession, lease, occupancy or
enjoyment of any Leased Real Property (except between the Companies). The use
and operation of the Leased Real Property by a Company in the conduct of the
Business do not violate in any material respect any Law, covenant, condition,
restriction, easement, license, permit or agreement. No material improvements
constituting a part of the Leased Real Property encroach on real
property owned by a Person other than the Companies. There are no Actions
pending nor, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened against or affecting the
Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein in the nature
or in lieu of condemnation or eminent domain proceedings.

  



  

(c)  The material improvements and fixtures on the Leased Real
Property are in good operating condition and in a state of good maintenance

for which they are presently being used. To Sellers' Knowledge, there are no
structural deficiencies or latent defects with any such improvements.

steam, compressed air, telecommunications, sewer, storm and waste water
systems and other utility services or systems for the Leased Real Property

the Business in the Ordinary Course. To Sellers' Knowledge, each such utility
service enters the Leased Real Property from an adjoining public street or
valid private easement in favor of the supplier of such utility service or
appurtenant to such Leased Real Property, and is not dependent for its access,
use or operation on any land, building, improvement or other real property
interest that is not included in the Leased Real Property.

(e)  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09(e), none of the Real
Property Leases have been assigned or sublet or amended, modified or
supplemented in any way except for the oral agreement between the Companies
for both Companies to use the premises leased pursuant to the Real Property
Leases. The Real Property Leases are in full force and effect. Neither of the
Companies nor, to Sellers' Knowledge, the landlords thereunder are in default
under the Real Property Leases, and, to Sellers' Knowledge, no event has
occurred or circumstance exists which, with the delivery of notice, the
passage of time or both, would constitute a breach or default, or permit the
termination, modification or acceleration of rent under any Real Property
Lease.

plants, structures, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, vehicles and
other items of tangible personal property of the Companies are structurally
sound to Sellers' Knowledge and are in good operating condition and repair,

Knowledge none of such buildings, plants, structures, furniture, fixtures,
machinery, equipment, vehicles and other items of tangible personal property

and repairs that are not material in nature or cost. The buildings, plants,
structures, furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, vehicles and other
items of tangible personal property currently owned or leased by each
Company, together with all other properties and assets of each Company, are
sufficient for the continued conduct of the Business after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing and
constitute all of the rights, property and assets necessary to conduct the
Business as currently conducted (it being understood that the current
facilities of the Companies will not be sufficient for growth or expansion of
the Business).

and (ii) Company Intellectual Property, including software, that are not
registered but that are material to the Business. All required filings and
fees related to the Company IP Registrations have been timely filed with and
paid to the relevant Governmental Authorities and authorized registrars, and
all Company IP Registrations are otherwise in good standing. To Sellers'

material documents, certificates, office actions, correspondence and other
materials related to all Company IP Registrations.

under) in any material respect, or has provided or received any notice of
breach or default of or any intention to terminate, any Company IP Agreement.

beneficial and, with respect to the Company IP Registrations, record owner of

necessary for the conduct of the Business as currently conducted, in each
case, free and clear of Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.

  



  

(d)  The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder
will not result in the loss or impairment of or payment of any additional

Property as owned, used or held for use in the conduct of such Company's
business or operations as currently conducted.

  



  

(e)  Each Company's rights in the Company Intellectual Property
are, as applicable, valid, subsisting and enforceable. Each Company has taken
reasonable steps to maintain its Company Intellectual Property and to protect
and preserve the confidentiality of all trade secrets included in the Company
Intellectual Property.

  



  

(f)  To Sellers' Knowledge, the conduct of the Business as
currently and formerly conducted, and the products, processes and services of
the Business, have not infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise
violated, and do not and will not infringe, dilute, misappropriate or
otherwise violate the Intellectual Property or other rights of any Person. To
Sellers' Knowledge, no Person has infringed, misappropriated, diluted or
otherwise violated, or is currently infringing, misappropriating, diluting or
otherwise violating, any Company Intellectual Property.

  



  

(g)  There are no Actions (including any oppositions,

(including in the form of offers to obtain a license): (i) alleging any
infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation of the
Intellectual Property of any Person by either Company; (ii) challenging the
validity, enforceability, registrability or ownership of any
Company Intellectual Property or a Company's rights with respect to any
Company Intellectual Property; or (iii) by a Company or any other Person

any outstanding or prospective Governmental Order (including any motion or

Section 4.05   _Investment Purpose_.

  



  

(a)  The shares of Sterling Commons Stock (and if applicable,
the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller) are being acquired for such
Seller's own account or the account of its affiliates, and with no present
intention of distributing the shares of Sterling Commons Stock (or if
applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller) or any part
thereof, and such Seller has no present intention of selling or granting any
participation in or otherwise distributing the same in any transaction in
violation of the securities laws of the United States of America or any
state, without prejudice, however, to such Seller's right at all times to
sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the shares of Sterling Common
Stock under a registration statement under the Securities Act and applicable
state securities Laws or under an exemption from such registration available
thereunder (including, if available, Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act). If such Seller should in the future decide to dispose of any
of its shares of Sterling Common Stock (or if applicable, the Promissory Note
in respect of such Seller), such Seller understands and agrees (i) that it
may do so only (A) in compliance with the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, as then in effect, or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or
(B) in the manner contemplated by any registration statement pursuant to
which such securities are being offered, and (ii) that stop-transfer
instructions to that effect will be in effect with respect to
such securities.

  



  

(b)  Such Seller is an "accredited investor," as such term is
defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act
and the investment by such Seller in Buyer is for its own account and not for
the account of others. The shares of Sterling Common Stock (and if
applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller) are being acquired
for investment and with no intention of distributing or reselling such shares
or any portion thereof or interest therein in any transaction which would be
a violation of the securities laws of the United States of America or any
state or foreign country or jurisdiction.

  



  

(c)  Such Seller has been given reasonable access to full and
fair disclosure of all material information regarding Buyer and the shares of
Sterling Common Stock (and if applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of
such Seller), including reasonable access to the books and records of Buyer.
Such Seller acknowledges and agrees that it has been provided, to its full
satisfaction, with the opportunity to ask questions concerning the terms and
conditions of an investment in Buyer.

  



  

   

37 
--- 

 



    

(d)  Such Seller understands that the shares of Sterling Common
Stock (and if applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller) are
"restricted securities" and have not been registered under the Securities Act
or any applicable state securities laws. Such Seller acknowledges that the
shares of Sterling Common Stock (and if applicable, the Promissory Note in
respect of such Seller) will bear a restrictive legend to that effect. Such
Seller acknowledges and agrees that such Seller must bear the economic risk
of this investment indefinitely, that the shares of Sterling Common Stock (and
if applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller) acquired by
such Seller hereunder may not be sold or transferred or offered for sale or
transfer by it without registration under the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws or the availability of exemptions
therefrom.

  



  

(e)  Such Seller has such knowledge, sophistication and
experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the shares
of Sterling Common Stock, and has so evaluated the merits and risks of such
investment. In this regard such Seller has relied solely upon professional
financial, legal and other advisors selected by and fully satisfactory to
such Seller, and has not relied upon Buyer or any of its advisors. Such Seller
is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the shares of Sterling
Common Stock (and if applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of
such Seller) and, at the present time and in the foreseeable future, is able
to afford a complete loss of such investment.

  



  

(f)  Such Seller understands that the shares of Sterling Common
Stock (and if applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller) are
being offered and sold to such Seller in reliance upon specific exemptions
from the registration requirements of United States federal and state
securities laws and that the Company is relying upon the truth and accuracy
of, and such Seller's compliance with, the representations, warranties,
agreements, acknowledgments and understandings, which are true, correct and
complete, of such Seller set forth herein in order to determine the
availability of such exemptions and the eligibility of the Seller to acquire
the shares of Sterling Common Stock (and if applicable, the Promissory Note in
respect of such Seller).

  



  

(g)  Such Seller represents that it has not entered into any
"short sales" (as defined in Rule 200 promulgated under Regulation SHO under
the Exchange Act of 1934), whether or not against the box, nor any forward
sale contracts, options, puts, calls, short sales or "put equivalent
positions" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(h) under the Exchange Act) nor any
other similar arrangements, or sales and other transactions through non-U.S.
broker dealers or foreign regulated brokers (any of the foregoing, an
"Indirect Sale") of or related to the Sterling Common Stock since the time it
first began discussions with Buyer about the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

securities laws and regulations, as applicable. Buyer is an "accredited
investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the

matters such that it is capable of evaluating the risks and merits of the
investment in and of protecting its own interests in connection with the

requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and (b) did not

or warranty made by Sellers hereunder not being true and correct in any
material respect or (C) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.02 to
be satisfied;

(ii)  any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

(iii)  any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

  



  

(iv)  any Actions commenced or, to actual knowledge of Sellers or
Principals, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting Sellers or the Company that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.16 or that relates to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Subject to Section 6.22, Buyer's receipt of information
pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall not operate as a waiver of any condition
set forth in Section 8.02, and shall not restrict in any way any termination
right of Buyer pursuant to Section 10.02.

  



  

Section 6.05   _Resignations_. Sellers shall deliver to Buyer written
resignations, effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers and directors
of each Company.

  



  

Section 6.06   _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing, each
Seller and Principal shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, hold in
confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning either
Company, except to the extent that such Seller or Principal can show that
such information (a) is generally available to and known by the public through
no fault of any Seller, Principal, or any of its respective Affiliates or any
of their respective Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by such
Seller, Principal, or any of its respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives from and after the Closing from sources which, to
such Person's actual knowledge, are not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If a Seller,
Principal, or any of their respective Affiliates are compelled to disclose any
information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, such Seller or Principal shall promptly notify Buyer in writing (
_provided_ that such notice is legally permitted) so that Buyer may seek, at
Buyer's sole cost, a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the
absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver from
Buyer, such Seller or Principal is nonetheless legally required to disclose
such information, such Seller or Principal may without liability hereunder,
disclose only that portion of such information which such Seller or Principal
is advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed.

  



  

Section 6.07   _Non-competition; Non-solicitation_.

  



  

(a)  In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, for
the period commencing on the Closing and ending seven years thereafter (the
"Restricted Period"), other than on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Companies), no Seller or Principal shall, nor shall such
Seller or Principal directly or indirectly through its Affiliates or
otherwise, (i) engage in or assist others in engaging; (ii) have an interest
in any Person that engages, directly or indirectly, in any capacity,
including as a partner, shareholder, member, investor, manager, employee,
principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or (iii) advise, lend money to,
guarantee the debts or obligations of, or permit its name or any part thereof
to be used or employed by any Person that engages, directly or indirectly in
any business carried on within the Territory which is the same or
substantially the same as all or any part of the Restricted Business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Seller or Principal may own, directly or
indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on any
national securities exchange if such Seller or Principal is not a controlling
Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not,
directly or indirectly, own 2% or more of any class of securities of such
Person.

  



  

   

44

(b)  During the Restricted Period, no Seller or Principal shall,
nor shall such Seller or Principal directly or indirectly through its
Affiliates or otherwise, in any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder,
member, investor, manager, employee, principal, agent, trustee or consultant
(i) contact or cause, induce or encourage any material actual or prospective
client, customer, supplier or licensor of the Restricted Business (including
any existing or former client or customer of the Companies and any Person
that becomes a client or customer of the Restricted Business after the
Closing), or any other Person who has a material business relationship with
the Restricted Business, to terminate or modify any such actual or prospective
relationship or otherwise interfere with such relationship or (ii) accept any
business in the Territory from or supply any goods or services in the
Territory to any material actual or prospective client, customer, supplier or
licensor of the Restricted Business (including any existing or former
client or customer of the Companies and any Person that becomes a client or
customer of the Restricted Business after the Closing).

  



  

(c)  During the Restricted Period, no Seller or Principal
shall, nor shall such Seller or Principal directly or indirectly through its
Affiliates or otherwise, hire or solicit any employee of either Company or
encourage any such employee to leave such employment or hire any such
employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a general
solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees;
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 6.07(c) shall prevent a Seller,
Principal or any of their respective Affiliates from hiring any employee
whose employment has been terminated by Buyer or either Company if at
least one year has elapsed from the date of such employment; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict any Seller or Principal
from providing career or employment advice to any of his immediate family
members who are currently employed by the Company, so long as in doing so (or
otherwise) he does not (x) take any of the actions in this Section
6.07(c) with respect to any company or business he has an economic ownership
or other interest in or (y) encourage or induce any such family member to be
employed or otherwise engaged by a Person engaged in the Restricted Business.

  



  

(d)  Each Seller and Principal acknowledges that a breach or
threatened breach of this Section 6.07 would give rise to irreparable harm to
Buyer, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby
agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by such Seller or
Principal of any such obligations, Buyer shall, in addition to any and all
other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of such
breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining
order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be
available from a court of competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to
post bond).

  



  

(e)  Each Seller and Principal acknowledges that the
restrictions contained in this Section 6.07 are reasonable and necessary to
protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and constitute a material inducement
to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any covenant contained in
this Section 6.07 should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic,
product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, then any court is expressly empowered to reform such covenant,
and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted
by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 6.07 and each
provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

(f)  If there is one or more defaults in the payment of Earn-
Out Payments and/or the Deferred Payments in an amount of $500,000.00 or more
and such default continues for a period of three months, then, in addition to,
and not in lieu of, all other rights and remedies of Sellers, the covenants
and agreements of Sellers set forth in this Section 6.07 shall automatically
terminate and become null and void.

  



  

(g)  For purposes of this Section 6.07, the term "Affiliate"
shall also include immediate family members of a Seller or Principal.

  



  

Section 6.08   _Governmental Approvals and Consents_.

  



  

(a)  Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, (i)
make, or cause or be made, all filings and submissions (including those under

the date of this Agreement and shall request "early termination" of the
waiting period) required under any Law applicable to such party or any of its
Affiliates; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause
to be obtained, all consents, authorizations, orders and approvals from all
Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Each party shall cooperate
fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain
all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties
hereto shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect of
delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals.

  



  

(b)  Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third parties that
are described in Schedule 3.04 and Schedule 4.02.

  



  

(c)  Without limiting the generality of the parties'
undertakings pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above, each of the
parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to:

  



  

(i)  respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority
regarding antitrust or other matters with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreement or document
contemplated hereby;

  



  

(ii)  avoid the imposition of any Governmental Order or the
taking of any action that would restrain, alter or enjoin the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreement or document
contemplated hereby; and

  



  

(iii)  in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the
ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any agreement or document contemplated hereby has been issued, to
have such Governmental Order vacated or lifted.

  



  

(d)  If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to
preserve any right or benefit under any Contract to which the Company is a
party is not obtained prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, subsequent to the
Closing, reasonably cooperate with Buyer and the Companies in attempting to
obtain such consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as
practicable without Sellers incurring any monetary obligations.

(e)  All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by
or on behalf of either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or
regulators of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
interactions between Sellers or the Companies with Governmental Authorities
in the Ordinary Course, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any
disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the
other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it
being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to
the other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or
contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the
other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact. Buyer, after consultation with Sellers'
Representative, shall take the lead in determining strategy for conducting
such meetings, discussions, appearances and contacts.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
6.08 shall require, or be construed to require, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or
after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, the
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating
to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the
economic or business benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

of such Seller which relate to the Company and its operations for periods
prior to the Closing; and

another party with access to any books or records (including personnel files)

Section 6.10   _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the

advice of counsel) or in connection with the Financing, no party to this
Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news
media without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the parties
shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such announcement.

  



  

Section 6.12   _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, (i) each
of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,

Commission; and (ii) Sellers and Sellers' Representative shall, prior to
making any Retention Payments to certain employees of the Companies, notify
Buyer in writing of the amount of the applicable Retention Payment for each
such employee and the date such Retention Payment is intended to be paid. The
parties hereto understand and hereby agree that the funding of any payment of
any Retention Payments shall come from Sellers and that Buyer shall have no
financial obligation for any Retention Payments except as expressly
provided in this Agreement. Should Buyer have a Tax withholding obligation
under applicable Law with respect to the Retention Payments, as determined by
Buyer upon the advice of legal counsel after consultation with Sellers'
Representative, then Sellers and Sellers' Representative shall timely
transfer to Buyer a sufficient amount of cash for Buyer to timely effectuate
such withholding obligation.

Disclosure Schedules that it has delivered pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to any matter which should have been included in the Disclosure
Schedules as of the date hereof but was unintentionally omitted at such time
or any matter first existing or occurring after the date hereof which, if
existing or occurring at or prior to the date hereof, would have been
required to be set forth or described therein or which is necessary to
correct any information in the Disclosure Schedules which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby. Each supplemental disclosure that is delivered to Buyer
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.22 shall not be deemed to be a
revision of the applicable representation, warranty, covenant, Disclosure
Schedule, or Exhibit, as applicable; _provided_ that, Buyer Indemnitees shall
not be entitled to any indemnification with respect to such
supplemental disclosure until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect
of such supplemental disclosure exceeds $750,000, in which event the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover all such Losses in excess of
$750,000, subject to the other limitations set forth in Article VIII IX. The
delivery of such supplemental disclosure shall not be deemed a waiver of any
condition set forth in Section 8.02 and shall not restrict in any way any
termination right of Buyer pursuant to Section 10.01;  _provided_ that, for
purposes of Section 10.01, "material" shall mean $100,000 or more with respect

Excluded Contract Retainage. The Companies shall not settle or compromise any
Excluded Contract Retainage without the prior written consent of Sellers'
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

(b)  Simultaneously with the delivery of the Closing Working
Capital Statement, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers' Representative
a schedule setting forth its good faith determination of (i) the Substantially
Completed Contracts, (ii) the Excluded Contract Retainage related thereto and
(iii) the amount of cash or cash equivalents received by Buyer with respect to
such Excluded Contract Retainage prior to delivery of such schedule (net of
the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of collecting any of such
Excluded Contract Retainage). During the Review Period, Sellers'
Representative shall review such schedule and the examination and review
provisions set forth in Section 2.04(b) shall also apply to review of such
statement. Upon final and conclusive determination of which construction
Contracts are Substantially Completed Contracts pursuant to the examination
and review process set forth in Section 2.04 (whether by reason of the
absence of any objections by Sellers' Representative or the resolution of any
disputes by Buyer and Sellers' Representative and/or the Independent
Accountant), Buyer shall, within five Business Days, pay in cash to an
account designated in writing by Sellers' Representative for further payment
by Sellers' Representative to Sellers in accordance with Sellers' applicable
Selling Percentages an amount equal to cash or cash equivalents received by
Buyer or the Companies following the Closing through the date of payment with
respect to any portion of the Excluded Contract Retainage. Thereafter, Buyer
shall cause the Companies to transfer and pay to Sellers' Representative for
further distribution to Sellers in accordance with their Selling Percentages
the amount of any Excluded Contract Retainage collected by the Companies (net
of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of collecting such Excluded Contract
Retainage) within 30 days of its receipt by Buyer or the Companies.

Section 6.26   _Restricted Sterling Common Stock_.

  



  

(a)  In order to induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement,
each Seller agrees that, without the prior written consent of Buyer, such
Seller will not, for one year following the Closing, (i) offer, pledge, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any
option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or
otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of
Sterling Common Stock received pursuant to this Agreement (or, if
applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller), or publicly
disclose the intention to make any offer, sale, pledge or disposition or (ii)
enter into any Indirect Sale or any swap or other agreement that transfers, in
whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of, or any
rights (including voting rights) in respect of, such Sterling Common Stock
(or, if applicable the Promissory Note) in respect of such Seller), whether
any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by
delivery of Sterling Common Stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise.
Such Seller consents to Buyer's enforcing such agreement by, among other
things, issuing a stop transfer order to its stock transfer agent with respect
to the shares constituting the Sterling Common Stock and placing a
restrictive legend giving notice thereof on any certificates representing (or
in respect of any book entries as to) such shares of Sterling Common Stock
(and, if applicable, the Promissory Note in respect of such Seller)
during such one-year period.

  



  

(b)  Buyer shall (i) after the Closing, satisfy the current
public information requirements set forth in Rule 144 (c)(1) under the
Securities Act and (ii) after the first anniversary of the Closing, promptly
cooperate with Sellers in taking all actions reasonably requested by Sellers
to facilitate sales by Sellers in brokers' transactions pursuant to Rule
144(f)(1)(i) under the Securities Act, including the removal of any
"restrictive" legend on certificates evidencing the Common Stock Consideration
and providing an opinion of counsel at Buyer's cost if requested by the
transfer agent in connection with such removal.

  



  

Article VII 
 TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 7.01   _Tax Covenants_.

  



  

(a)  Without the prior written consent of Buyer, no Seller
(nor, prior to the Closing, any Company, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives) shall, to the extent it may affect, or relate to,
a Company, make, change or rescind any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or
take any position on any Tax Return, take any action, omit to take any action
or enter into any other transaction that would have the effect of increasing
the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of Buyer or a Company in respect
of any Post-Closing Tax Period. Each Seller agrees that Buyer is to have no
liability for any Tax resulting from any action of a Seller, a Company, its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, and agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer (and, after the Closing Date, the Companies) against
any such Tax or reduction of any Tax asset, subject to the limitations on
indemnification set forth in Article IX.

(b)  All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration,
value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents (including any real property transfer Tax and any other similar
Tax) shall be borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent
(50%) by Sellers when due. Buyer shall timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Sellers shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary).

  



  

(c)  Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Companies after the Closing Date with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and
without a change of any election or any accounting method and shall be
submitted by Buyer to Sellers' Representative (together with schedules,
statements and, to the extent requested by Sellers' Representative, supporting
documentation) at least 45 days prior to the due date (including extensions)
of such Tax Return. If Sellers' Representative objects to any item on any
such Tax Return, it shall, within 20 days after delivery of such Tax Return,
notify Buyer in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any
such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such
objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered, Buyer and
Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Sellers'
Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten days after
receipt by Buyer of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the
Independent Accountant and any determination by the Independent Accountant
shall be final. The Independent Accountant shall resolve any disputed items
within 20 days of having the item referred to it pursuant to such procedures
as it may require. If the Independent Accountant is unable to resolve any
disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by Buyer and then amended to reflect the Independent
Accountant's resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of a Company that
does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within the
control of Buyer.

  



  

(d)  None of the Companies or Sellers shall revoke any Company's
status as an S corporation within the meaning of Code Sections 1361 and 1362.
None of the Companies or Sellers shall take or allow any action that would
result in the termination of any Company's status as a validly electing S
corporation within the meaning of Code Sections 1361 and 1362.

  



  

(e)  From and after the Closing, the Companies and the Buyer
and their Affiliates shall not, without the prior written consent of Sellers'
Representative, make or cause to be made, any amended Tax Return filing for a
Company to the extent such filing, if accepted, would have the effect of
increasing the Tax liability of any of the Sellers or the amount of Taxes for
which the Sellers are obligated to indemnify Buyer, except to the extent
required by Applicable Law after consultation with Sellers.

  



  

Section 7.02   _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any
and all existing Tax sharing agreements (whether written or not) binding upon
a Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date neither
the Companies, Sellers nor any of Sellers' Affiliates or their respective
Representatives shall have any further rights or liabilities thereunder.

  



  

   

54 
--- 

 



    

Section 7.03   _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent treated as
a liability in the calculation of Closing Working Capital and subject to the
limitations on indemnification set forth in Article IX, Sellers shall
indemnify the Companies, Buyer, and each Buyer Indemnitee and hold them
harmless from and against (a) any Loss attributable to any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made in Section 3.21; (b) any
Loss attributable to any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform,
any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in this Article VII; (c)
all Pre-Closing Taxes of the Companies or relating to the Business for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (d) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which a Company (or any
predecessor of such Company) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date by reason of a liability under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign, state or local Law; (e) any
Taxes and Losses with respect to Taxes arising from either Company's failure
to qualify as an "S" corporation for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (f) any
and all Taxes of any person imposed on a Company arising under the principles
of transferee or successor liability or by contract, relating to an event or
transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date. In each of the above
cases, such indemnification will include any reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees) incurred in
connection therewith. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any Taxes of the
Companies that are the responsibility of Sellers pursuant to this Section
7.03 within ten Business Days after payment of such Taxes by Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Companies).

  



  

Section 7.04   _Straddle Period_. In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to a taxable period that begins before and ends after
the Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any
such Taxes that are treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this
Agreement shall be:

  



  

(a)  in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to,
income, receipts, profits, wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed in
connection with the sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (iii)
required to be withheld, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and

  



  

(b)  in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.

  



  

Section 7.05   _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

  



  

(a)  At Buyer's option, Buyer and each Seller shall (i) join in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any election
corresponding to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code under foreign, state, or local
laws) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares of each Company
hereunder (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"), (ii) provide to
the other party the necessary information to permit the Section 338(h)(10)
Election to be made; and (iii) take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing IRS Form 8023 and any necessary forms, returns, elections,
schedules and other documents) as may be required to effect and preserve
timely the Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any provisions comparable to
Section 338(h)(10) of state or local Tax Law). Such applicable forms shall be
duly executed by Sellers and an authorized person for Buyer at Closing.

  



  

(b)  Any Tax imposed on a Company attributable to the making of
the Section 338(h)(10) Election including without limitation (i) any Tax
imposed under Code Section 1374, (ii) any Tax imposed under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d)(2), or (iii) any state, local, or
non-U.S. Tax imposed on any Company's gain shall be the sole responsibility of
Buyer and the Companies; and Sellers shall have no liability for such Taxes.

  



  

   

55 
--- 

 



    

(c)  Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or
other Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on their Tax
Returns to the extent required by applicable Law. Buyer shall pay to Sellers'
Representative within seven days after Sellers and Buyer agree to the
Allocation an amount of additional consideration (as determined in good faith
by both Sellers and Buyer) resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election in
an amount equal to: (i) any additional Taxes paid by Sellers as a result of
any portion of the gain recognized by a Company upon the Section 338(h)(10)
Election being characterized as ordinary income rather than capital gain
(i.e., Buyer shall be responsible to pay Sellers for the excess of the amount
that is taxed at ordinary income rates over the amount that would have been
paid if such amount had been taxed at capital gains rates) and (ii) to the
extent not covered in (i), any state or local Taxes paid by Sellers as a
result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election if such Taxes would not have been
required to be paid but for the Section 338(h)(10) Election (collectively (i)
and (ii) being the "Catch-Up Payment") plus (x) an additional amount (the
"Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount to Sellers after the incremental
federal, state and local Tax liability incurred by the Sellers due solely to
the Catch-Up Payment and the Gross-Up Payment equals the Catch-Up Payment. If
Buyer and Sellers are unable to reach an agreement with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 7.05(c), the item(s) in question shall be
resolved by the Independent Accountant, with such resolution to be determined
no later than 20 days prior to the regular due date for filing of
Sellers' income tax return for the year in which the Section 338(h)(10)
Election is made by the Parties. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Sellers and Buyer.

  



  

(d)  Buyer shall determine the amount of the "aggregate deemed
sales price" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4, but
excluding selling costs) and prepare, and provide to Sellers' Representative
within 90 days after the Closing Date, an allocation for tax purposes of such
amount among the assets of each Company (the "Allocation") in a manner
consistent with Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. The Allocation shall be binding upon Buyer, the Companies and
Sellers unless Sellers shall, within 45 days of delivery of the Allocation to
Sellers' Representative, provide to Buyer written notice of its objection to
the Allocation and the reasons therefor, in which event the parties
hereto shall endeavor in good faith to agree upon an Allocation. If the
parties hereto cannot resolve such objection, the item in question shall be
resolved by the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Sellers and Buyer. The
parties hereto shall, except as otherwise required by Law, (i) file all Tax
Returns that are affected by a Section 338(h)(10) Election in a manner
consistent with the Allocation, as finally agreed upon by the parties hereto,
and (ii) not take any position before any Governmental Entity that is
inconsistent with such Allocation.

  



  

(e)  Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall take, or cause to be
taken, any action or inaction, or do, or cause to be done, any things that
would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying
for a Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  



  

Section 7.06   _Contests_. Buyer agrees to give written notice to
Sellers' Representative of the receipt of any written notice by a Company,
Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates which involves the assertion of any claim,
or the commencement of any Action, in respect of which an indemnity may be
sought by Buyer pursuant to this Article VII (a "Tax Claim");  _provided_
that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer's right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Sellers forfeit rights or
defenses or are otherwise prejudiced by reason of such failure. Buyer shall
control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim; _provided, however_ ,
that Buyer shall obtain the prior written consent of Sellers' Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering
into any settlement of a Tax Claim or ceasing to defend such Tax Claim; and,
_provided, further_ , that Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Tax Claim and to employ counsel of its
choice for such purpose, the fees and expenses of which separate counsel
shall be borne solely by Sellers.

Section 7.07   _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Sellers and
Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return
pursuant to this Article VII or in connection with any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Company. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or
portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work
papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax
authorities. Each of Sellers and Buyer shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard
to extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of
such extensions for the respective Tax periods. Prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of a Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Sellers or Buyer (as the case may be)
shall provide the other party with reasonable written notice and offer the
other party the opportunity to take custody of such materials.

  



  

Section 7.08   _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any
indemnification payments pursuant to this Article VII shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Closing Cash Consideration by the parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

  



  

Section 7.09   _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the provisions of Section 3.21 and this Article VII shall
survive for the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations plus 60
days.

  



  

Section 7.10   _Conflict_. To the extent that any obligation or
responsibility pursuant to Article IX may conflict with an obligation or
responsibility pursuant to this Article VII, the provisions of this Article
VII shall govern.

  



  

Section 7.11   _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refund, credit or similar
benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto)
relating to the Companies for Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be the property of Sellers unless such refund is attributable to Taxes paid
by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies if paid after the Closing)
for such Pre-Closing Tax Period.

before the Closing.

  



  

(b)  Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Article
IX, each Seller shall, severally but not jointly, indemnify and defend the
Buyer Indemnitees against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

  



  

   

61 
--- 

 



    

(i)  any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations
or warranties of such Seller contained in Article IV or Section 6.14(b); or

  



  

(ii)  any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement
or obligation to be performed by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement after
the Closing Date (other than any breach or violation of, or failure to fully
perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VII,
it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach, violation or
failure shall be pursuant to Article VII).

  



  

(c)  Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Article
IX, each Principal shall, severally but not jointly, indemnify and defend the
Buyer Indemnitees against, and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses
incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnitees based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any breach or non-fulfillment
of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by such
Principal pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.03   _Indemnification By Buyer_. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Article IX, Buyer shall indemnify and defend each
Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnitees") against, and shall hold each of them harmless from
and against, and shall pay and reimburse each of them for, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnitees
based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of:

  



  

(a)  any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations
or warranties of Buyer contained in Article V or in any certificate delivered
at Closing by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; or

  



  

(b)  any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
obligation to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (other than
any breach or violation of, or failure to fully perform, any covenant,
agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VII, it being understood that
the sole remedy for any such breach, violation or failure shall be pursuant to
Article VII).

  



  

Section 9.04   _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for
in Section 9.02 and Section 9.03 shall be subject to the following
limitations:

  



  

(a)  Sellers shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnitees for
indemnification under Section 9.02(a)(i) or Section 9.02(b)(i) until the
aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section
9.02(a)(i) and Section 9.02(b)(i) exceeds $750,000 (the "Basket"), in which
event the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover all such Losses in
excess of the Basket, subject to the other limitations set forth in this
Article IX; _provided_ , that, with respect to any claim as to which the
Buyer Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.02(a)(i)
or Section 9.02(b)(i), Sellers shall not be liable for indemnification as to
(i) any individual claim that is not part of a series of related claims or
(ii) any series of related claims, in each case if the Losses related to such
claim or series of related claims do not exceed $15,000 (which Losses shall
not be counted as Losses for purposes of calculating whether the aggregate
amount of all Losses exceeds the Basket). The aggregate amount of all Losses
for which Sellers shall be liable pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) and Section
9.02(b)(i) shall not exceed $7,000,000 (the "General Cap").

  



  

   

62 
--- 

 



    

(b)  Buyer shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnitees for
indemnification under Section 9.03(a) until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 9.03(a) exceeds the Basket,
in which event the Seller Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover all such
Losses in excess of the Basket. The aggregate amount of all Losses for which
Buyer shall be liable pursuant to Section 9.03(a) shall not exceed the
General Cap.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth
in Section 9.04(a) and Section 9.04(b) shall not apply to Losses based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of (i) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any Fundamental Representations or any representation or warranty
set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.09(a) and Section 3.18 and
Section 3.19 or (ii) fraud, willful breach or intentional or willful
misrepresentation.

  



  

(d)  The aggregate liability of Sellers, collectively, under
this Agreement for any Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to or
by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in the first sentence of Section 3.09(a) and Section 3.18, and Section
3.19 shall not exceed an amount equal to the unused portion of the
General Cap plus $3,000,000; _provided_ that Losses based upon, arising out
of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.09(a)
or Section 3.18, or Section 3.19 shall only be counted towards the General
Cap if such Losses exceed $3,000,000 in which event only Losses in excess of
$3,000,000 shall be included in such calculation.

  



  

(e)  The aggregate liability of Sellers, collectively, under
this Agreement for any Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to or
by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representations or
any breach of a covenant shall not exceed the Consideration, other than for
fraud, willful breach or intentional or willful misrepresentation.

  



  

(f)  The aggregate liability of each Seller under this
Agreement shall be limited to the amount of the Consideration
actually received by such Seller; _provided, however_ , that the limitation
of a particular Seller's liability shall not apply to: (i) such Seller's own
breach of Section 6.06 (Confidentiality), Section 6.07 (Non-Competition and
Non-Solicitation), Section 6.12 (Further Assurances), Section 6.14 (Release),
Section 11.01 (Expenses) or Section 11.10 (Governing Law; Submission to
Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial), or (ii) any claims relating to, arising
out of or otherwise attributable to such Seller's own fraud, willful breach,
or intentional or willful misrepresentation; _provided_ , _further_ , 
_however_ , that, in the event that and to the extent of the amount as to
which, Buyer Indemnitees are prevented by the provisions of this Section
9.04(f) from obtaining indemnification from one or more Sellers as to any
Losses for which other Sellers are jointly and severally liable hereunder,
such other Sellers shall be liable to Buyer Indemnitees for the amount of such
Losses, pro rata in accordance with the Selling Percentages of such Sellers
(but always subject to any limitations on such liability imposed by other
provisions of this Agreement).

  



  

(g)  For the avoidance of doubt, no Seller shall be liable for
another Seller's breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
Article IV or for another Seller's breach of a covenant or agreement to be
performed after the Closing.

  



  

(h)  In connection with any claim for indemnification under this
Agreement (including Article VII), the Buyer Indemnitees shall first exercise
the set off rights with respect to the First Deferred Payment, the Second
Deferred Payment, the Earn-Out Payments, and the Promissory Notes, in that
order, before seeking recovery directly from any Seller, and such set-off
rights shall be subject to the limitations on the liability of Sellers as set
forth in this Article IX. Furthermore, in exercising its set off rights under
Section 11.13 on account of a Seller's breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Article IV or for such Seller's breach of a covenant or
agreement to be performed after the Closing, Buyer may only set off its
Losses against Post-Closing Payments in which such Seller participates up to
the amount of such Seller's _pro rata_ share of such Post-Closing Payment.

  



  

   

63 
--- 

 



    

(i)  The amount of any and all indemnification payments by
Sellers in respect of Losses under this Agreement (including Article VII)
shall be reduced by any amounts actually recovered by the Buyer Indemnities
under insurance policies, indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements net
of any deductibles and costs of collection (collectively, "Alternative
Arrangements") with respect to such Losses (which amounts the Buyer
Indemnitees agree to, and shall cause their Affiliates and
Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain). If an
indemnification payment is received by a Buyer Indemnitee, and any
Buyer Indemnitee or a Company later receives proceeds or recoveries from any
Alternative Arrangement in respect of the related Losses, Buyer shall
immediately pay to the Sellers Representative, for the benefit of the Sellers,
a sum equal to the lesser of (i) the actual amount of such proceeds or
recoveries net of any deductibles and costs of collection or (ii) the actual
amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by the Sellers with
respect to such Losses (including amounts paid through the exercise of
Buyer's set-off rights under this Agreement).

  



  

(j)  Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article IX in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by an amount equal to any
Tax benefit recognized for Tax purposes and realized or reasonably expected to
be realized as a result of such Loss by the Indemnified Party; provided that,
any tax benefit to the Indemnified Party to be realized in future tax years
will be discounted to its present value (using a discount rate of 3%, annual
discounting and a termination value of zero) for the year in which such Loss
occurred in determining the Tax benefit to the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(k)  Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates
to take, commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming
aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or
does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum extent
necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss; _provided_ that
an Indemnified Party shall only be obligated to incur commercially reasonable
costs in connection with such mitigation. Losses shall be determined without
duplication of any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made
under this Article IX. An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover
more than once, directly or indirectly, for the same Loss.

  



  

(l)  In no event will Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees under
this Agreement (including Article VII) include any liabilities included in
Closing Working Capital, as finally determined.

  



  

(m)  Sellers shall not have any liability to any Buyer Indemnitee
under this Agreement (including Article VII) for any Losses arising out of or
attributable to a Company's classification of personnel (including
subcontractors) as employees or independent contractors for any period from
and after the Closing Date, it being understood that Buyer and the Companies
shall be solely responsible for classification of such personnel from and
after the Closing Date and Sellers shall have no liability therefor.

Section 9.05   _Indemnification Procedures_. The party making a claim
under this Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the
party against whom such claims are asserted under this Article IX is referred
to as the "Indemnifying Party".

  



  

(a)   _Third Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives
notice of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party
is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of
such notice of such Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise materially
prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party
within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's
expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided_ that, if the
Indemnifying Party is a Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that (x)
is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or
customer of the Company, unless such Third Party Claim is in excess of
$750,000.00 in which case Seller has the right to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or (z) is asserted against a Company by a
Governmental Entity and involves criminal allegations. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to
Section 9.05(b), it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party, there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided
in this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 9.05(b), pay,
compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim
(subject to the limitations on indemnification contained in this Article IX).
Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects
in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making
available (subject to the provisions of Section 6.06) records relating to
such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

  



  

   

65 
--- 

 



    

(b)   _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter
into settlement of (including any type of agreed judgment) any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as provided in
this Section 9.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim
without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary
form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within
ten days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue
to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the
terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 9.05(a), it
shall not agree to any settlement or consent to the entry of any judgment
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

(c)   _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on
account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than 30 days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct
Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or
if otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party
and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent
any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified
Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such
information and assistance (including access to the Companies' premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or
records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such
claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(d)   _Tax Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in
respect of Taxes of the Company (including, but not limited to, any such claim
in respect of a breach of the representations and warranties in Section 3.21
hereof or any breach or violation of or failure to fully perform any covenant,
agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VII) shall be governed
exclusively by Article VII.

  



  

   

66 
--- 

 



    

Section 9.06   _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the
Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this
Agreement (including Article VII), (a) the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy
its obligations within 15 Business Days of such final, non-appealable
adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds and (b) the
parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment
of any such obligations within such 15 Business Day period, any amount
payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication to and including the
date such payment has been made at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3%
(but not to exceed the maximum lawful rate of interest). Any interest due
hereunder shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the
actual number of days elapsed.

  



  

Section 9.07   _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement (including Article VII)
shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Consideration for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

  



  

Section 9.08   _Effect of Investigation_. The representations and
warranties of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known
that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate (
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that any inaccuracy set forth in a
supplemental disclosure delivered in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.22 shall have the effects provided herein) or by reason of the
Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in Section 8.02 or
Section 8.03, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 9.09   _Exclusive Remedies_. Except for the agreements set
forth in Section 2.04, Section 2.06, Section 6.03, Section 6.06, Section
6.07, Section 6.24 and Section 11.11, the parties acknowledge and agree that
their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than
claims arising from fraud, criminal activity, willful misrepresentation, or
intentional or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VII and this
Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based
upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
Article VII and this Article IX. Nothing in this Section 9.09 shall limit any
Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person
shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any party's fraud,
criminal activity, willful misrepresentation or intentional or willful
misconduct.

  



  

Article X

(b)  by Buyer by written notice to Sellers' Representative if
Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and
there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by one or more Sellers
and such breach, inaccuracy or failure has not been cured by such Seller(s)
within ten days of Sellers' Representative's receipt of written notice of
such breach from Buyer; or

  



  

(c)  by Sellers' Representative by written notice to Buyer if a
Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and

the first Business Day thereafter) for any reason other than delay or
nonperformance of the party (or the party that such party represents) seeking
such termination; or

  



  

(e)  by Buyer or Sellers' Representative by written notice in
the event that (i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited or
(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order
restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-appealable.

  



  

Section 10.02   _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with this Article, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party

for any fraud, intentional or willful misconduct, or willful breach of any
provision hereof by such party.

Section 11.07   _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No Seller may assign its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of Buyer and Buyer
may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of Sellers' Representative; _provided, however_ , that, prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer may, without the prior written consent of
Sellers' Representative or any Seller, assign all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement (including the right to receive the Shares) to
one or more of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. No assignment
shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

Section 11.08   _No Third-party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in
Section 7.03 and Article IX, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and

other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.09   _Amendment and Modification; Waiver_. Except as provided
in Section 6.22, this Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented
by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto. No waiver by any
party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly
set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver by any
party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure,
breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of
a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that
waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege.

  



  

Section 11.10   _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

  



  

(a)  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Texas without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of

(b)  ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE

TEXAS IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE CITY OF HOUSTON AND HARRIS COUNTY, AND EACH
PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY
SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY
PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR
CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH
PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.10(C).

  



  

Section 11.11   _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.12   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 11.13   _Set-Off_. Subject to Section 9.04(h), Buyer will have the
right to withhold and set off against the First Deferred Payment, the Second
Deferred Payment, the Earn-Out Payments, and the Promissory Notes, in that
order, the amount of any Post-Closing Adjustment to which Buyer may be
entitled under this Agreement or any indemnification claim against Sellers
under Article VII or Article IX which has either been (a) agreed to in
writing by Sellers' Representative or (b) adjudicated as a final, non-
appealable decision in Buyer's favor by a court of competent jurisdiction, and
that has not been paid by Sellers. If a scheduled payment in respect of the
Earn-Out Payments, the Second Deferred Payment, the First Deferred Payment,
or the Promissory Notes, becomes due, but such indemnification claims have
neither been (i) agreed to in writing by Sellers' Representative, or (ii)
adjudicated as a final, non-appealable decision in Buyer's favor by a court
of competent jurisdiction, then such scheduled payment (together with accrued
interest, if any) shall be deposited into escrow with an independent escrow
agent mutually agreeable to Buyer and Sellers' Representative to be held by
such escrow agent in accordance with a commercially reasonable escrow
agreement approved by Buyer and Sellers' Representative, to be released
pursuant to (A) written agreement by Buyer and Sellers' Representative or (B)
adjudicated by a final, non-appealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction. Except as specifically set forth above, in no event will Buyer
or its Affiliates have any right to withhold or set off any amounts payable
to Sellers, Principals, or their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Sellers' Representative have the right to agree
to a set-off under this Section 11.13 with respect to a Seller's breach of
Article IV or a breach by a Seller of covenant or agreement to be performed by
such Seller after Closing.

Section 11.14   _Sellers ' Representative_. Each Seller agrees that
Sellers' Representative is hereby constituted and appointed as agent and
attorney-in-fact with full power and right of substitution, for and on behalf
of each Seller, with the sole and exclusive right and power on behalf of each
Seller to execute and deliver any and all certificates and other
documents required to be executed and delivered by any Seller hereunder, to
give and receive notices and communications hereunder and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Sellers' Representative for the
accomplishment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents (except to the extent that this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document expressly contemplates that the foregoing shall be
done by such Seller individually). No bond shall be required of
Sellers' Representative, and Sellers' Representative shall receive no
compensation for services rendered. Notices or communications to or from
Sellers' Representative shall constitute notice to or from Sellers. A
decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers' Representative shall
constitute a decision of all Sellers and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each Seller, and Buyer may rely upon any written decision,
act, consent or instruction of Sellers' Representative as being the decision,
act, consent or instruction of each Seller. Each Seller, individually on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby acknowledges that, subject to the
timely payment by Buyer of the Consideration pursuant to this Agreement to
Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall have no liability or responsibility
whatsoever for any failure of Sellers' Representative to make any
further payment of funds payable under this Agreement to such Seller in
accordance with its applicable Selling Percentage or Engasser/Wolf Selling
Percentage, as the case may be (including, without limitation, payment of such
Seller's portion of the Consideration). Buyer is hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by it in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers' Representative. The
Sellers' Representative shall not have the authority to act on behalf of, or
otherwise bind, any Seller with respect to any alleged breach by such Seller
of Article IV or any alleged breach by such Seller of any covenant or
agreement under this Agreement to be performed by such Seller after the
Closing.

  



  

Section 11.15   _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (including the
related portions of the Disclosure Schedules), no party hereto or any other
Person has made or makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty, either written or oral, on behalf of such party or its Affiliates,
including any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness
of any information regarding such party or its Affiliates furnished or made
available to the other parties hereto and their Representatives (including any
information, documents or material made available in any data room,
management presentations or in any other form in expectation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) or as to the future revenue, profitability
or success of the Companies or, as applicable, the other parties hereto, or
any representation or warranty arising from statute or otherwise in Law.

Section 11.16   _Representation_. The parties to this Agreement
acknowledges that Bourland, Wall and Wenzel, P.C. ("BWW") currently serves as
counsel to (a) the Companies on the one hand and/or (b) the Sellers on the
other hand, in each case including in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There may come a time,
including after consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, when the interests of the Sellers on the one hand and the
Companies on the other hand may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason,
the Sellers, BWW or the Companies believe that BWW cannot any longer, or
should no longer, represent both the Sellers on the one hand, and the
Companies on the other hand. The parties understand and specifically agree
that BWW may withdraw from representing the Companies and continue to
represent the Sellers even if the interests of the Sellers on the one hand,
and the interests of the Companies on the other hand, are or may be adverse,
including in connection with any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and even though
BWW may have represented the Companies in a matter substantially related to
such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for the Companies or any of
its Affiliates, and Buyer and the Companies hereby consent thereto and waive
any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of the parties
further agrees that, as to all communications among BWW, the Companies, and
the Sellers, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client
confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege that attach as a
result of BWW representing the Companies shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in effect, _provided_ that any such privilege, from and after the
Closing, shall belong to the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by
the Companies or any its Affiliates. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of
the parties hereto agrees to take the steps necessary to ensure that any
privilege attaching as a result of BWW representing the Companies shall
survive the Closing, remain in effect and be controlled by the Sellers. As to
any privileged attorney client communications between BWW on the one hand,
and the Companies and/or the Sellers on the other hand, prior to the Closing
Date (collectively, the "Privileged Communications"), each of Buyer and the
Companies, together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or
assigns, agree that no such Person may access, use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of
the parties hereto after the Closing. In addition, if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, the Companies shall have no
right of access to or control over any of BWW's records related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall become the property
of (and be controlled by) the Sellers. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute
between the Sellers on the one hand, and the Companies on the other hand,
arising out of or relating to any matter in which BWW acted for them both,
none of the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence
or any other rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure
to the Sellers any information or documents developed or shared during the
course of BWW's representation of the Sellers on the one hand, and the
Companies on the other hand.

  



  

Section 11.17   _Trustee Capacity_. Each Person executing this Agreement
in the capacity of a trustee of a trust has executed and delivered this
Amendment, not in his or her individual capacity, but solely as trustee of
such trust. The performance of this Agreement by a trustee and any and all
duties, obligations and liabilities of a trustee hereunder will be effected by
him or her only as trustee and not in his or her individual capacity. The
trustee does not undertake nor will he or she have any personal liability or
obligation of any nature whatsoever by virtue of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement in the capacity as trustee of a trust.

  



  

Section 11.18   _Liability of a Principal_. For the avoidance of doubt, a
Principal shall only be liable for Losses resulting from his own breach, in
his individual capacity, of Section 6.06, Section 6.07, or Section 6.14.
