as adjusted under _Section 2.3_ (the " _Purchase Price_ "). For purposes of

another Group Company shall be excluded.

2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) _Closing Adjustment_.

(i) At least three Business Days before the Closing, Sellers shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the Companys good faith estimate
of Closing Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "),
which statement shall contain an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of
the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated

Closing Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital.

(c) _Examination and Review_.

(i) _Examination_. After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement,
Sellers Representative shall have 30 days (the " _Review Period_ ") to review
the Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Sellers
Representative and Sellers Accountants shall have full access to the books
and records of the Group Companies, the personnel of, and work papers prepared
by, Buyer and/or Buyers Accountants to the extent that they relate to the
Closing Working Capital Statement and to such historical financial information
(to the extent in Buyers possession) relating to the Closing Working Capital
Statement as Sellers Representative may reasonably request for the purpose
of reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement
of Objections (defined below); _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall
be in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of
Buyer or the Operating Subsidiary.

(ii) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Sellers
Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by
delivering to Buyer a written statement setting forth Sellers
Representatives objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed
item or amount and the basis for Sellers Representatives disagreement
therewith (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If Sellers Representative
fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the
Review Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers. If
Sellers Representative delivers the Statement of Objections before the
expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and Sellers Representative shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within 30 days after the
delivery of the Statement of Objections (the " _Resolution Period_ "), and,
if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing
Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may
have been previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Sellers Representative,
shall be final and binding.

 



11 (iii) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Sellers Representative and Buyer fail
to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the
Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any
amounts remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ " and any amounts not so
disputed, the " _Undisputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for resolution to
the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified
public accountants other than Sellers Accountants or Buyers
Accountants appointed by mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers
Representative (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") who, acting as experts and
not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any
adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the
Closing Working Capital Statement. All adjustments shall be made without
regard to materiality. The Independent Accountants shall only decide the
specific items under dispute by the Sellers Representative and Buyer and
their decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values
assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively.

 

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountants_. Sellers shall pay a portion of the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants equal to 100% multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of Disputed Amounts submitted
to the Independent Accountants that are resolved in favor of Buyer (that being
the difference between the Independent Accountants determination and
Sellers Representatives determination) and the denominator of which is the
total amount of Disputed Amounts submitted to the Independent Accountants
(that being the sum total by which Buyers determination and Sellers
Representatives determination differ from the determination of the
Independent Accountants). Buyer shall pay that portion of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accountants that Sellers are not required to pay
hereunder. 

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountants_. The Independent Accountants

letter from the Internal Revenue Service, or with respect to a prototype plan,
can rely on an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the
prototype plan sponsor, to the effect that such Qualified Benefit Plan is
so qualified and that the plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from
federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the

subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject any Group Company or,
with respect to any period on or after the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, to a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA or to tax or penalty
under Section 4975 of the Code. All benefits, contributions and premiums

Law, no Benefit Plan provides benefits or coverage in the nature of health,

accelerate the vesting of or provide any additional rights or benefits
(including funding of compensation or benefits through a trust or otherwise)
to any employee, director or consultant, except as a result of any partial
plan termination resulting from this Agreement; or (iii) limit or restrict
the ability of Buyer or its Affiliates to merge, amend or terminate any
Benefit Plan, in each case, as a result of the execution of this Agreement.
Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will result in "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.

 

(g) Other than as required under Section 601, et. seq. of ERISA or other
applicable Law, no Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree welfare
benefits to any individual for any reason, and neither any Group Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability to provide post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits to any individual or ever represented, promised
or contracted to any individual that such individual would be provided with
post-termination or retiree welfare benefits.

(h) Neither any Group Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has (i)

material liability under Title I or Title IV of ERISA or related provisions of
the Code or foreign Law relating to employee benefit plans; (ii) failed to
timely pay premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; (iii)
withdrawn from any Benefit Plan; or (iv) engaged in any transaction which
would give rise to liability under Section 4069 or Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

in any limitation on Buyer or any of its Affiliates from amending or
terminating any Benefit Plan. No Group Company has any commitment or
obligation, and no Group Company has made any representations, to any
employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant, whether or
not legally binding, to adopt, amend or modify any Benefit Plan or any
collective bargaining agreement, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Should any such fact or condition require any change in the Disclosure
Schedules if the Disclosure Schedules were dated the date of the occurrence or
discovery of any such fact or condition, Sellers will promptly deliver to
Buyer a proposed supplement or amendment to the Disclosure Schedules
specifying such change (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ "). Any Schedule
Supplement will require Buyers prior written approval, in its discretion.

(c) Buyers receipt of information pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ will not
operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or
agreement given or made by Sellers, the Company and the Operating Subsidiary
in this Agreement. Buyer may, but is not obligated to, terminate this
Agreement if any such information relates to an event, development or
occurrence that would result in, or reasonably be expected to result in, the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_ to be satisfied.
Buyers failure to terminate this Agreement will not affect its rights to
indemnification under _Section 9.2_.

effective as of the Closing Date, of the officers and directors of each Group
Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing.

6.5 _Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs_. For a period of 90 days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Operating Company not to,
terminate the employment of employees of the Operating Subsidiary to the

Sellers.

6.6  _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by any of the Group Companies now existing in favor of each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who
becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of any of the Group
Companies, or who, while a director or officer of any of the Group Companies,
is or was serving at a Group Companys request as a director, officer,
partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another domestic or foreign
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or
other entity, as provided by Law or in the organizational documents of the
Group Companies, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms for a period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date.

(b) The Group Companies shall, and Sellers shall cause the Group Companies to
obtain as of the Closing Date, at the sole expense of Sellers, "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policies with a claims period of
six (6) years from the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and
amounts, and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to
the directors and officers of the Group Companies, in each case with respect
to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to
the Closing Date (including in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement). This covenant will not be considered satisfied by the
Sellers, the Company or the Operating Subsidiary in all material respects if
such parties fail to obtain such "tail" insurance.

6.7  _Confidentiality_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement is binding upon Buyer, remains in full force and
effect and, in addition, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in
accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, information
provided to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that Buyers
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement will terminate upon the
Closing. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this _Section
6.7_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect. From and after the
Closing, Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates to, hold, and will
use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives
to hold, in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral,
concerning each Group Company, except to the extent that a Seller shows that
such information (a) is generally available to and known by the public
through no fault of such Seller, any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by such Seller, any of its
Affiliates or their respective Representatives from and after the Closing
from sources that are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If any Seller or any of its
Affiliates or their respective

 



51 Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, such Seller will
promptly notify Buyer in writing and use reasonable best efforts to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information. To the extent that such Seller
is unable to obtain such a protection order or is otherwise compelled to
disclose such information, such Seller will disclose only that portion of such
information that such Seller is advised by its counsel in writing is legally
required to be disclosed.

6.8 _Governmental Approvals and Other Third-party Consents_.

 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals from all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party shall
cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking
to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. The parties
to this Agreement shall not willfully take any action that will have the
effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals. If required by the HSR Act and
if the appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act has not been filed prior to
the date hereof, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement within ten Business Days after the date hereof and to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authority
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act. Buyer and Sellers will equally split all filing fees
payable under the HSR Act.

(b) Without limiting the generality of their undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.8_, each party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and to
take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable
the parties to this Agreement to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as possible; provided, that nothing in this Agreement
will require, or be construed to require, Buyer or any of its Affiliates to or
agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after
the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Buyer, the Group
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, or otherwise take any actions
that would limit the freedom of action of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; (ii)
any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of
any such assets, businesses or interests that, in either case, could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially
and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Buyer of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) any material
modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the
event and for so long as Buyer is litigating, contesting or defending against
any claim relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereunder or relating to circumstances or activities occurring on or prior to
Closing involving any Seller, each Seller will cooperate (and make
appropriate representatives available to cooperate) with Buyer as reasonably
necessary in connection therewith, and Buyer will reimburse Seller for its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs related thereto.

 



52 (c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
any party hereto before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators
of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any
interactions between Sellers, the Company and the Operating Subsidiary with
Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure
which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure containing confidential
information) shall be disclosed to the other party hereto in advance of any
filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings,
discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and
proposals. Each party shall give notice to the other parties with respect to
any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental
Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such
notice being sufficient to provide the other parties with the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

(d) The Company and the Operating Subsidiary shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from, all third
parties that are described in _Schedule 8.2(h)_ and such other notices and
consents as are reasonably requested by Buyer, including, but not limited to,
providing financial statements and other financial information as third
parties may request, reasonably agreeing to commercially reasonable
adjustments to the terms of the agreements with such third parties, and
executing agreements to effect the assumption of such agreements on or before
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Sellers, the Company, the
Operating Subsidiary nor any other Group Company shall be obligated to pay or
provide any consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent
or approval is requested. Buyer will reasonably cooperate with the Company
and the Operating Subsidiary in obtaining any such consents by, at the
reasonable request of the Company or the Operating Subsidiary, providing
financial statements and other financial information of Buyer as third
parties may reasonably request, reasonably agreeing to commercially reasonable
adjustments to the terms of the agreements with such third parties, or
executing agreements to effect the assumption of such agreements effective as
of the Closing.

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Sellers or the Group Companies and in connection with Tax and
financial audits and reporting of Sellers arising in the ordinary course of
business, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing or such longer
period as may be required by Law, Buyer shall:

 

(i) retain the books and records of the Group Companies relating to periods
prior to the Closing in a manner reasonably consistent with Buyers document
retention policies and practices; and

(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the Representatives of Sellers reasonable
access (including the right to make, at Sellers expense, photocopies), during
normal business hours, to such books and records; provided that the access and
use by Sellers of any information contained in such books and records is
limited to the purposes described above and it subject to the confidentiality
obligations under _Section 6.7_.

 



53 (b) Sellers will not retain any books or records relating to the Group
Companies and will, promptly after the Closing, provide such books and
records to Buyer; provided, that Sellers may retain copies of such information
necessary for Sellers Tax and audit reporting.

 

(c) Neither Buyer, Sellers, nor any of the Group Companies shall be obligated
to provide the other party with access to any books or records (including
personnel files) pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ where such access would
violate any Law.

6.10  _Closing Conditions_. From the date hereof until the Closing, each
party hereto shall, and Sellers shall cause the Company and Operating
Subsidiary to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are

(c) Each Seller, the Company and the Operating Subsidiary agrees that the
rights and remedies for noncompliance with this _Section 6.14_ will include
having such provision specifically enforced by any court having equity
jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or
threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that money
damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer.

 

6.15 _Release by Sellers_.

(a) Except as hereinafter provided, each Seller, on such Sellers own behalf

directors, agents, employees and its or their respective successors and

Closing Date, irrevocably and unconditionally releases, waives and forever
discharges the Buyer and the Parent and each of the Company, the Operating
Subsidiary, the other Group Companies, and their respective officers,
directors, partners, predecessors, affiliates, agents and employees and their

any and all actions, causes of action, suits, debts, covenants, contracts,
claims, demands, damages, losses, costs, expenses, penalties, rights, remedies
and liabilities or proceedings of any nature of whatsoever kind or nature, in
law or equity, past or present, known or unknown, that they have ever had from
the beginning of time, now have, or hereafter can, will or may have or in the
future may assert, whether known or unknown, fixed or
contingent (collectively, " _Claims_ ") against any Releasee, but only to the
extent arising from any act, omission, event or transaction occurring on or
prior to the Closing, including the ownership of the Shares by such Seller
(collectively, the " _Released Claims_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 6.15_ does not release the Releasees with respect to claims arising
out of, based on or resulting from (i) this Agreement or (ii) if a Seller is
an employee of the Company, any Claims

 



55  for salary or wages due to such Seller solely in such employee capacity or
(iii) if a Seller is now or has been at any time prior to the Closing Date an
officer or director of any of the Group Companies, or who, while a director
or officer of any of the Group Companies, is or was serving at a Group
Companys request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent
of another domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, joint venture,

assignment, transfer, encumbrance, pledge or any other disposal of any
interest in any Released Claim.

this Agreement or at the Closing. Each Seller understands and acknowledges
that it and any Releasor may discover facts different from, or in addition to,
those that it currently knows or believes to be true with respect to
the claims released herein and agrees that the terms of this _Section 6.15_
will be and remain effective in all respects, notwithstanding any subsequent
discovery of different or additional facts.

 

(d) Each Seller irrevocably agrees to refrain from directly or indirectly
asserting any claim or demand or commencing (or causing to be commenced) any
suit, action or proceeding of any kind against any Releasee, based upon or in
connection with any matter purported to be released pursuant to this _Section
6.15_.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

7.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

(a) The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, at the sole expense of the Buyer all Tax Returns for each Group Company
for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after
the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (except to the extent there is no reasonable
basis therefor, or a change in Law or fact). The Buyer will deliver to the
Sellers Representative a copy of each such Tax Return at least fourteen (14)
days prior to filing. The Sellers Representative shall have ten (10) days
after receipt of any such Tax Return to provide the Buyer with comments on the
Tax Return and the Buyer shall consider all comments made by the Sellers
Representative with respect thereto in good faith. If, after the Buyers
receipt of the Sellers Representatives comments, there is a dispute between
the Sellers Representative and the Buyer with respect to any such Tax
Return, the dispute shall be resolved according to the procedures described in
_Section 7.7_. As soon as practicable following the preparation of such Tax
Return, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay and deliver to the Buyer out of the
Escrow Funds all Taxes as finally determined in accordance with _Section 7.7_
(except to the extent that such Taxes were included in 

 



56  the Closing Date Working Capital calculation), if any, imposed on any Group
Company with respect to such Tax Return and the Buyer shall remit to the
appropriate Governmental Authority the amount of the Taxes so disbursed to
the Buyer at the time the Buyer files (or causes to be filed) such Tax Return
with the appropriate Governmental Authority. If a dispute with respect to a
Tax Return described in this _Section 7.1_ has not been resolved prior to
the due date of such Tax Return, the Buyer shall have the right to file (or
cause to be filed) such Tax Return and shall file (or cause to be filed) an
amended Tax Return, if needed, after the dispute has been resolved, and
the preceding sentence shall apply with respect to both the original Tax
Return as filed by the Buyer and the amended Tax Return (if any). All refunds
or other benefits received by the Group Companies with respect to all Tax
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Refunds_ ") shall be
remitted to the Sellers Representative, for the benefit of Sellers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be entitled to the portion of
any Refunds resulting from a carry back of a net operating loss, Tax credit
or similar item sustained or arising in any period (or portion thereof) ending
after the Closing Date with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of each Group Company with respect to periods ending
after the Closing Date, and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes of each
Group Company shown thereon or otherwise imposed on or payable by each Group
Company with respect to any such period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, as
soon as practicable following the preparation of such Tax Returns, the
Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall deliver joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to pay and deliver to the Buyer out of the Escrow Funds
all Taxes as finally determined in accordance with _Section 7.7_ (except to
the extent that such Taxes were included in the Closing Date Working Capital
calculation), if any, imposed on any Group Company to reimburse the Buyer to
the extent any payment the Buyer is required to make relates to the portion
of any Straddle Period ending on the close of business on the Closing Date, as
determined pursuant to this _Section 7.1_. All Taxes of any Group Company
that relate to any taxable year or period that includes but does not end on
the Closing Date (each such period, a " _Straddle Period_ ") shall be
apportioned between the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other
hand, as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes other than income, profit, gains,
sales and use and withholding Taxes, on a per diem basis, and (ii) in the case
of income, profit, gains, sales and use and withholding Taxes, as determined
from the books and records of the Group Companies as though the taxable year
of each Group Company terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

7.2  _Cooperation and Assistance_. The Buyer, the Sellers and the Sellers
Representative shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and
filing all Tax Returns and amended Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes
and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, including by
maintaining and making available to each other all records reasonably
necessary in connection with such Tax matters and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings
relating to such Tax Claim.

 

7.3 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all Tax sharing agreements or practices
to which any Group Company is a party or otherwise subject shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and after the Closing Date no Group Company
shall be bound thereby, have any liability thereunder, or make any payment
thereunder.

 



57 7.4 _Tax Elections; Waivers; Settlement or Compromise_. Except as otherwise
expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement, between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, no Group Company shall, without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, make any election regarding Taxes, execute any waiver of
restrictions on assessment or collection of any Tax, or settle or compromise
any claim regarding any Tax.

7.5 _Amended Returns and Retroactive Election_. Except as required by
applicable Law or a Governmental Order, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause
or permit any Group Company to, (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with respect
to any tax year ending on or before the Closing Date or with respect to any
Straddle Period or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive effect to
any such year or Straddle Period, in each case without the prior written
consent of Sellers Representative, unless such consent is unreasonably
delayed or withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding of consent
to any such amendment or election that would increase any monetary liability
of Sellers in the aggregate with respect to Taxes shall be deemed to
be reasonably withheld.

7.6 _Tax Claims_.

(a) After the Closing, each of the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall
promptly notify the other party in writing upon receipt (in the case of the
Representative, by either the Representative or any Seller) of any written
notice of any pending or threatened audit or assessment, suit, proposed
adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative or judicial proceeding or
similar claim relating to Taxes (" _Tax Claim_ ") with respect to Losses for
which the Sellers could be liable under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that Buyers delay or failure to so notify the Sellers Representative shall
only relieve the Sellers of their obligations to the extent, if at all, that
they are materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure.

(b) The Buyer will control, without affecting its rights to indemnification
under this Agreement, the defense of all Tax Claims; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Sellers Representative and its counsel (at the Sellers
Representatives sole expense) may participate in (but not control the
conduct of) the defense of any such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Buyer may not settle or compromise any Tax Claim relating to a taxable
period that ends on or before the Closing Date or, with respect to any
taxable period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date, the
portion of such taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date,
without the Sellers Representatives consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Disputes concerning whether or
not consent of the Sellers Representative has been unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed will be referred to the Independent Accountant pursuant
to  _Section 7.7_ below for resolution.

7.7 _Dispute Resolution for Tax Matters_. With respect to any
dispute, controversy or claim relating to Taxes between the Buyer and any
Group Company (prior to the Closing), or between the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative (for any Tax for which an indemnity claim may exist), the Buyer
and the Company or the Sellers Representative, as applicable, shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute, controversy or claim between
them for a period of twenty Business Days from the date written notice of such
dispute, controversy or claim is received by the Buyer or the Sellers
Representative, as the case may be; but if the applicable parties are unable
to resolve such

 



58  dispute, controversy or claim, the parties shall submit the dispute,
controversy or claim for resolution, which resolution shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties, to the Independent Accountant or a
mutually agreed upon tax lawyer who is (i) a partner in a law firm; (ii)
familiar with transactions or operations of the sort at issue; and (iii)
independent with respect to each party. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants relating to any dispute as to the amount of Taxes owed shall be
paid by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative, on the
other hand, in proportion to each partys respective liability for the
portion of the Taxes in dispute, as determined by the Independent Accountants.

7.8 _Tax Information_. On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer any information regarding the Sellers that may be
required under Code section 6043A with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If there is any inconsistency between a
provision of this _Article VII_ and any other provision of this Agreement
with respect to Tax matters, the provisions of this _Article VII_ shall
prevail.

reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim on or prior to the date on which the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim is based ceases to survive
as set forth in this _Section 9.1_, and the failure to assert any such claim
prior to the date provided in this _Section 9.1_ shall be deemed a waiver of
such claim.

 



63 9.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of
this  _Article IX_ , the Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and
defend each of Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the

the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and will pay and
reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of, with

Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and will pay and
reimburse each of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by,
or imposed upon, the Buyer Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of,
with respect to or by reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy, or breach of any representation or warranty of any Seller
in _Article IV_ of this Agreement; or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of, any covenant, agreement or obligation
of any Seller under this Agreement.

9.4 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of
this _Article IX_ , Buyer shall indemnify each of Sellers and their Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, successors and assigns (collectively,
the " _Sellers Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and shall hold the Sellers
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and will pay and reimburse each
of them for, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the
Sellers Indemnified Parties based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents; or

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents.

 



64 9.5 _Certain Limitations_. The indemnification provided for in _Sections 9.2_
,  _9.3_ and _9.4_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Sellers shall not be liable to the Buyer for indemnification under
_Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_ , as the case may be, until the aggregate amount
of all Losses in respect of indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ or
_9.3(a)_ exceeds $500,000.00 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the
Sellers shall only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of the
Deductible. With respect to any claim as to which the Buyer may be entitled to
indemnification under  _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_ , as the case may be,
the Sellers shall not be liable for any individual Losses or series of related
Losses which do not exceed $10,000.00 (" _De Minimis Losses_ "). The De
Minimis Losses shall not be counted toward the Deductible applicable to the
Sellers, unless all such De Minimis Losses exceed $50,000.00 in the aggregate,
in which case all such De Minimis Losses will be counted toward such
Deductible.

 

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Sellers shall be liable
(i) pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or  _9.3(a)_ , as the case may be, shall
not exceed $13,000,000.00; and (ii) pursuant to Section 9.2(c) shall not
exceed $50,000,000.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations contained in _Sections
9.5(a) and 9.5(b)_ will not limit the Sellers obligations to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of any Losses that any Buyer Indemnified
Party may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as a result of fraud or
intentional misrepresentation or with respect to the Excluded Representations;
_provided_ , that the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Sellers
shall be liable under this Agreement (other than Losses that any Buyer
Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as a result of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation) shall not exceed the Enterprise
Value. 

(d) No claim for indemnification may be asserted against Sellers under
_Section 9.2(c)_, unless written notice of such claim is received by
Sellers Representative describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim on or prior to
the date that is five years from the Closing Date, and the failure to assert
any such claim prior to the date provided in this _Section 9.5(d)_ shall be
deemed a waiver of such claim.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Sections 9.2_ and
_9.3_ , no Individual Seller will be liable for more than his or her Pro Rata
Share of any Losses.

(f) The Buyer shall not be liable to the Sellers for indemnification under 
_Section 9.4(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all Losses in respect of
indemnification under _Section 9.4(a)_ exceeds the Deductible, in which event
Buyer shall only be required to pay or be liable for Losses in excess of
the Deductible. With respect to any claim as to which the Sellers may be
entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.4(a)_, Buyer shall not be liable
for any De Minimis Losses. The De Minimis Losses of the Buyer shall not be
counted toward the Deductible applicable to the Buyer, unless all such De
Minimis Losses exceed $50,000.00 in the aggregate, in which case all such De
Minimis Losses will be counted toward such Deductible.

 



65 (g) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which Buyer shall be liable
pursuant to  _Section 9.4(a)_ shall not exceed $13,000,000.00. The aggregate
amount of all Losses for which the Buyer shall be liable under this Agreement
for matters other than _Section 9.4(a)_ (other than Losses that any Sellers
Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as a result of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation) shall not exceed the Enterprise Value.

(h) Payments by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.3(a)_ in
respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage
that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Buyer (or any
of the Group Companies) in respect of any such claim (net of deductibles or
other Losses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of such
claim, all direct collection expenses and any increased premium costs).

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, solely for the purposes
of determining Losses, each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
will be deemed made without any qualifications or limitations as to
materiality or words of similar import.

 

(j) In no event shall the Sellers be liable to the Buyer for any punitive or
special damages or any damages that arise solely from the special
circumstances of Buyer that have not been communicated to the Sellers (in each
case, other than any such damages paid or payable to a third party).

(k) Each Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise
thereto, including incurring only commercially reasonable costs to remedy the
breach that gives rise to such Loss.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the right of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedies
will not be affected in any way by any investigation conducted or knowledge
(whether actual, constructive or imputed) acquired at any time by any such
party with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with or
performance of, any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation or by the waiver of any condition.

9.6 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If Buyer, Sellers or Sellers Representative or the
Representatives of any of the foregoing parties (each an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any action,
suit, claim or other legal proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not
a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a
Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against any
Sellers Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to which
Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. Except
as provided in _Section 9.1_, the failure to give such prompt written notice
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such delay. Such notice by the Indemnified Party 

 



66  shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party,
to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to 
_Section 9.6(b)_, it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend
such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to  _Section 9.6(b)_, pay, compromise, defend
such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based
upon, arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. Sellers and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to
the provisions of _Section 6.7_) records relating to such Third-Party Claim
and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-
pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-
defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the
defense of such Third-Party Claim.

 

(b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this _Section 9.6(b)_. If a firm offer is made to settle a
Third-Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial
or other obligation or adverse effect on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree
to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect
to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such
firm offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and
in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the
Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such
Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant
to _Section 9.6(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. Except as provided in _Section 9.1_, the failure to give
such prompt written notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the 

 



67  Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such delay. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate
the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall
allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

9.7 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

9.8 _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to _Sections 2.3_ , _6.14_ , _6.15_ , 
_7.6_ and _Section 12.11_, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other than claims
arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal actions) for
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
set forth herein, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article IX_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein it may have against the other parties
to this Agreement and their Affiliates and each of their respective
Representatives arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_. Nothing in this
_Article IX_ shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain (a) any
equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled or (b) any remedy on
account of any partys fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal
actions. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 9.8_ does not limit any
partys rights with respect to any of the Related Documents.

ARTICLE X 

TERMINATION

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyer;

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Sellers, the Company

failure of any of the conditions specified in _Article VIII_ and such breach,
inaccuracy or failure is not cured by Sellers, the Company or the Operating
Subsidiary within 15 Business Days of written notice of such breach from

68 (ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section
8.2_ shall not have been fulfilled, or are unable to be fulfilled, by August

failure of Buyer to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing;

(c) by Sellers by written notice to Buyer if:

(i) Sellers are not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
and there has been a material breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
specified in _Article VIII_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure is not
cured by Buyer within 15 Business Days of written notice of such breach from
Sellers; or

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.3_
shall not have been fulfilled, or are unable to be fulfilled, by the Drop Dead
Date, unless such failure shall be due to the failure of Sellers to perform
or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be
performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing; or

(d) by Buyer or Sellers in the event that:

(i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or

(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order
restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-appealable.

 

10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Article X_ , this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any party
hereto except:

(a) as set forth in this _Article X_ and _Section 6.7_ and _Article XI_
hereof; and

(b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability for any
intentional breach of any provision hereof.

ARTICLE XI

 

APPOINTMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE

11.1 _Appointment_. Each Seller hereby appoints Harwood Capital, LLP to act as
such Sellers sole true and lawful attorney-in-fact, agent and proxy under
this Agreement and the Related Documents (the " _Sellers  Representative_"),
with full and exclusive power and authority, including power of substitution
and resubstitution, acting in the name of and for and on behalf of 

 



69  such Seller (a) to amend or waive any provision of this Agreement or any
Related Document, (b) to review and accept or dispute the Post-Closing
Adjustment pursuant to  _Section 2.3(c)_, (c) to initiate, prosecute,
contest, negotiate, defend, compromise or settle any claim for which an
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (d)
to receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement or any of the Related Documents, (e) to execute and deliver on
behalf of Sellers the Related Documents, (f) to pay expenses incurred by
Sellers Representative, on behalf of such Seller, in connection with this
Agreement and the Related Documents, (g) to establish such reserves as
Sellers Representative deems necessary or desirable, (h) allocating among,
and paying to, each Seller any amounts paid to Sellers under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, in accordance with the Sellers Schedule, and (i) to
do all other things and to take all other action under or related to this
Agreement or any of the Related Documents that the Sellers Representative
may consider necessary or proper to effectuate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and to resolve any dispute with the Buyer over any aspect
of this Agreement and, on behalf of such Seller, to enter into any agreement
to effectuate any of the foregoing, which shall have the effect of binding
such Seller as if such Seller had personally entered into such an agreement.
This appointment and power of attorney granted to the Sellers Representative
shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and all authority conferred
hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to termination by
operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity or liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of any Seller or the occurrence of any other event
or events and the Sellers Representative may not terminate this power of
attorney with respect to any Seller or any of its respective successors,
assigns, heirs, next-of-kin, representatives, administrators, executors,
directors, officers, employees, partners, members, agents or affiliates
without the prior written consent of the Buyer. Without limiting the
foregoing, any determination or resolution (in any proceeding, by agreement or
otherwise) of any dispute, controversy or claim relating to this Agreement or
the Related Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby to
which the Sellers Representative (in its capacity as such) is a party shall
be binding on all Sellers and their respective successors, assigns, heirs,
next-of-kin, representatives, administrators, executors, directors, officers,
employees, partners, members, agents and affiliates. Sellers Representative
shall pay to each Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share of any amounts payable
to Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Amount promptly upon receipt of
such funds, subject to reserves for and payment of (i) expenses incurred by
Sellers Representative on behalf of such Seller, and (ii) any contingent or
accrued liability of such Seller in connection with this Agreement and the
Related Documents which, in Sellers Representatives sole discretion, should
be reserved against or paid. Buyer will have no liability or obligation to
any Seller with respect to the Sellers Representatives payment, non-payment
or apportionment of, or reserves relating to, such funds to Sellers.

 

11.2 _Personal Liability_. Neither the Sellers Representative nor any agent
employed by it shall incur any liability to any Seller relating to the
performance of its duties or exercise of its rights hereunder, except for
actual fraud or bad faith acts by the Sellers Representative or pursuant to
the commission by the Sellers Representative on a continuing basis of acts
or omissions determined to be willful misconduct or grossly negligent. The
Sellers Representative shall likewise incur no liability by reason of any
error of Law or for any act or omission related thereto. Each of the
Sellers hereby severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers Representative and any agent employed by it against any
loss, liability or expense incurred (a) without fraud or bad faith on the part
of the Sellers Representative and (b)

 



70  other than pursuant to the commission by the Sellers Representative of acts
or omissions determined to be willful misconduct or grossly negligent arising
out of or in connection with its performance or exercise of obligations and
rights under this Agreement. To the extent the Sellers Representative is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 11.2_, each Seller
shall bear its Pro Rata Share of amounts payable to satisfy such claim.

11.3 _Right to Counsel_. Each Seller agrees that the Sellers
Representative may consult with counsel chosen by the Sellers Representative
and shall have full and complete authorization in good faith to act or refrain
from acting in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The Sellers
Representative may rely and shall be protected in acting, or refraining from
acting, upon any written notice, instruction or request furnished to the
Sellers Representative hereunder and reasonably believed by the Sellers
Representative to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties.

11.4 _Removal_. Upon the written agreement or consent of the Sellers who held
Shares representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares (excluding any
such Company securities held by the Sellers Representative, if any)
immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall be entitled to change the
Sellers Representative by delivery of a written notice to such effect to the
Buyer at any time. The Sellers Representative shall be permitted to resign by
at least thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Sellers and the
Buyer and, in such event, or upon the death or incapacity of the Sellers
Representative, a replacement Sellers Representative shall be chosen within
thirty (30) days of the resignation, death or incapacity of the Sellers
Representative by action of the Sellers who held Shares representing more than
fifty percent (50%) of the Shares, which new Sellers Representative shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. Any such replacement Sellers
Representative will promptly execute a joinder agreement in form reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer, pursuant to which such replacement Sellers
Representative will agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

or established in a jurisdiction other than the United States of America, be
deemed to include a reference to that which most nearly approximates to that
U.S. Legislation or U.S. Legal Term in that jurisdiction.

 



72  This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule
requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an
instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Schedules
and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with, and as an integral
part of, this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein.

 

12.4 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and
shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. 

12.5 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this

party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of
its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign

indirect parent or Subsidiary of Buyer without the consent of any other party;
_provided_ that Buyer will remain primarily liable for its obligations
hereunder.

 

12.8 _No Third-party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Article IX_ , this

73  identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different
character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. Except as
provided in _Section 9.1_, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising,
any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall
operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege.

12.10  _Mediation; Binding Arbitration_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 2.3(c)(v)_ , _6.14_ , _7.6_
 and _12.11_ , any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the rights of the parties will be submitted to JAMS, or its
successor, for mediation, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation
as provided herein, then it will be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for
final and binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this
Section. The agreement of the parties to arbitrate covers all disputes of
every kind relating to or arising out of this Agreement, including actions
for breach of contract with respect to this Agreement, as well as any claim
based upon tort or any other causes of action relating to this Agreement, such
as claims based upon an allegation of fraud or misrepresentation and claims
based upon a federal or state statute. The arbitrator selected according to
procedures set forth below will determine the arbitrability of any matter
submitted, and that determination will be final and binding on the parties.

 

(b) Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other
party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the
dispute and the relief requested.

(c) The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting
a mediator from the JAMS panel of neutrals and in scheduling a mediation
meeting (in person or via teleconference). The parties will share equally the
costs of the mediation.

(d) All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written,
made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents,
employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees,
are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including
impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not
be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
mediation.

(e) Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters
submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time
following the initial mediation session or at any time following 30 days from
the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first
(" _Earliest Initiation Date_ "). The mediation may continue after the
commencement of arbitration if the parties mutually agree.

(f) At no time prior to the Earliest Initiation Date shall either side
initiate an arbitration or litigation related to this Agreement except to
pursue a provisional remedy that is authorized by law or by JAMS Rules or by
agreement of the parties. However, this limitation is inapplicable to a party
if the other party refuses to comply with the requirements of subsection (c)
above.

 



74 (g) All matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the rights of
the parties (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) will be governed by and
construed and interpreted under the Laws of the State of Delaware without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of
Delaware. The arbitration will be conducted in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The
arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the " _JAMS Rules_ "), subject to the
agreements set forth herein. The arbitrator will not have the power to add to,
modify or change any of the provisions of this Agreement, or to make mistakes
of law. The parties may conduct discovery, including document requests,
depositions and interrogatories, in accordance with Delaware law.

(h) The arbitration will be conducted by one neutral arbitrator mutually
agreed upon by the parties. If no arbitrator is agreed upon within 10 days
following commencement of arbitration, or if the arbitrator selected by the
parties is unable or unwilling to arbitrate the dispute, the arbitrator will
be such neutral arbitrator as is selected by JAMS. The award in writing of the
arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties.

 

(i) The arbitrator will be bound to honor claims of privilege or work-product
doctrine recognized at law, but the arbitrator will have the discretion to
determine whether any such claim of privilege or work product doctrine applies
based upon applicable law or ethical rules.

(j) The arbitrator will provide a reasoned basis for the resolution of each
dispute and for any award. The arbitrator will have power and authority to
award any remedy or judgment that could be awarded by a court of law or
equity in the State of Delaware not inconsistent with or in addition to the
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(k) Except as set forth in this _subsection (k)_ or in _subsection (l)_
below, each party will bear its own costs in connection with any arbitration
or mediation proceeding. The costs of the arbitration and mediation, including
any JAMS administration fee, and arbitrators and mediators fees, and costs
of the use of facilities during the hearings, will be borne equally by the
parties in the first instance. The arbitrator shall, as part of the award,
apportion the costs of arbitration and mediation based on the extent to which
each Party prevailed.

 

(l) If a party to this Agreement brings any arbitration action, or any other
action, suit, counterclaim or appeal, for any relief against the other
parties, declaratory or otherwise, to enforce the terms hereof or to declare
rights hereunder (referred to herein as an " _Action_ "), the non-prevailing
party in such Action will be required to pay to the prevailing party in such
Action a reasonable sum for the prevailing partys attorneys fees and
expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending such Action and/or enforcing any
judgment, order, ruling or award (referred to herein as a " _Decision_ "),
granted therein. Any Decision entered into in such Action will contain a
specific provision providing for the recovery of attorneys fees and expenses
incurred in enforcing such Decision. The court or arbitrator may fix the
amount of reasonable

 



75  attorneys fees and expenses upon the request of any party. For purposes of
this Section, attorneys fees will include, without limitation, fees incurred
in connection with (1) postjudgment motions and collection actions, (2)
contempt proceedings, (3) garnishment, levy and debtor and third party
examination, (4) discovery, and (5) bankruptcy litigation.

 

(m) Nothing in this Section will limit a partys ability to (i) enforce an
arbitration award in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, or (ii) obtain
specific performance or other injunctive relief.

12.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity.

12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed
to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by
facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall be deemed
to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this
Agreement.

12.13 _Non-recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly
named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations
set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative of any party
hereto or of any Affiliate of any party hereto, or any of their successors or
permitted assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim or action based on,
in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby, except to
the extent that any such Person is a party hereto.
