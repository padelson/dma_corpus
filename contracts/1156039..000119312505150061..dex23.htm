Board of Directors of Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall take all actions and shall obtain all necessary consents and releases
from all of the holders of all the outstanding stock options and other rights
to purchase Common Stock (the " _Options_ ") heretofore granted under any
Company stock option plan or

hereunder, to (i) provide for the cancellation, effective at the Effective

options, warrants, rights or agreements which would entitle any Person, other
than a Parent Party or its Affiliates, to own any capital stock of Company or
any of the Subsidiaries or to receive any payment in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 2.1.4.5_ to the
contrary, payment of the Option Cash Payment may be withheld with respect to
any Option until necessary consents and releases are obtained.



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Effective
Time Companys Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall take all such actions and shall obtain all necessary consents and
releases from all of the holders of the Options described below to ensure that

Amount in accordance with _Section 2.1.4.5(c)_ or _Section 2.1.4.7_ , shall,
at the Closing, be deposited into the Escrow Account referred to in _Section
2.1.4.7_. (such amount, the " _January 19 Option Escrow Amount_ ") and (b) if
a holder of a January 19 Option (a " _January 19 Option Holder_ ") is still
employed by Surviving Corporation (or Parent) as of the first anniversary of
the Effective Date (the " _Anniversary Date_ "), such January 19 Option Holder
shall be entitled to receive his or her applicable portion of the January 19
Option Escrow Amount (including interest and investment income thereon) in
cash on, or as soon as administratively practicable after, the Anniversary
Date; _provided_ , that if, prior to the Anniversary Date, any January 19
Option Holder is no longer employed by Surviving Corporation (or Parent)
due to death, Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreements),
termination by Surviving Corporation without "cause" (as defined below), or
termination by the January 19 Option Holder for Constructive Discharge (as

entitled to receive the remaining portion of his or her applicable Option Cash
Payment portion of the January 19 Option Escrow Amount (including interest and
investment income thereon) in cash on, or as soon as administratively
practicable after such termination. If any January 19 Option Holder is not
still employed by Surviving Corporation (or  



 

10  Parent) as of the Anniversary Date (other than in the circumstances
described in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence), the remaining
January 19 Option Escrow Amount attributable to such January 19 Option Holder
(including interest and investment income thereon), upon release of such
amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement shall be distributed pro rata
to the Company Stockholders, the Option Holders (other than pursuant to the
January 19 Options held by such persons) and the Warrant Holders in the same
proportions in which all portions of the Merger Consideration not part of the
Escrow Account are payable pursuant to this Agreement. None of the Parent
Parties shall have any liability or obligation to any holder of a January 19
Option with respect to any act or omission of the Company Stockholders
Representatives or the release of any January 19 Option Escrow Amount from
the Escrow Account. For purposes of this _Section 2.1.4.5(b)_ , "cause" shall
mean the conviction of a January 19 Option Holder of a felony involving moral
turpitude or fraud and/or embezzlement against Parent and/or Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries. At the Effective Time, in full payment of
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to

such actions and shall obtain all necessary consents and releases from all of
the holders of the Options described below to ensure that, prior to the

together, the " _Executives_ ") less (ii) the aggregate portion of the Merger
Consideration attributable to Executives constituting part of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount in accordance with  _Section 2.1.4.7_ (such amount, the "
_Holdback Option Cash Payment_ "), shall, at the Closing, be deposited into
the Escrow Account referred to in _Section 2.1.4.7_ and (b) (i) if an
Executive is still employed by Surviving Corporation (or Parent) as of the
Anniversary Date, such Executive shall be entitled to receive 50% of his or
her applicable portion of the Holdback Option Cash Payment in cash on the
Anniversary Date (without payment of any interest or income earned thereon)
and (ii) if an Executive is still employed by Surviving Corporation (or
Parent) as of the second anniversary of the Effective Date (the " _Holdback
Second Anniversary Date_ "), such Executive shall be entitled to receive the
remaining 50% of his or her applicable portion of the Holdback Option Cash
Payment in cash on the Holdback Second Anniversary Date (without payment of
any interest or income earned thereon); _provided_ , that if, prior to the
Holdback Second Anniversary Date, an Executive is no longer employed by
Surviving Corporation (or Parent) due to death, Disability (as defined in the
Employment Agreements), termination by Surviving Corporation without "cause"
(as defined below), or termination by the Executive for Constructive
Discharge (as defined in the Employment Agreements), such Executive (or such
Executives estate, as the case may be), upon written request from such
Executive (or estate, as the case may be) to Parent, Surviving Corporation
and each Company Stockholders Representative, shall be entitled to receive
the remaining portion of his or her applicable portion of the Holdback Option
Cash Payment (without payment of any interest or income earned thereon) in
cash as soon as administratively practicable after such termination. If any
Executive is not still employed by Surviving Corporation (or Parent) as of the
Anniversary Date or Holdback Second Anniversary Date (other than in the
circumstances described in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence),
all remaining portions of the Holdback Option Cash Payment which are
attributable to such Executive shall, upon release of such amount in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, be distributed to Parent (together with
any interest or income earned thereon). For purposes of this sub-Section,
"cause" shall mean the conviction of an Executive of a felony involving moral
turpitude or fraud and/or embezzlement against Parent and/or Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiaries. At the Effective Time, in full payment of
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
Executives, Parent shall deliver an amount equal to the aggregate of the
Holdback Option Cash Payment referred to above, to the Escrow Agent, who shall
place it in the Escrow Account.



2.1.4.6 _Conversion of Warrants_. Subject to _Section 2.1.4.5_ , _Section
2.1.4.7_ , _Section 2.1.4.8_ and the last sentence of _Section 2.1.4.9_ ,
each warrant to purchase Common Shares, as set forth on _Schedule_  



 

11   _2.1.4.6_ (each a " _Warrant_ "), granted to any Warrant Holder, shall be
canceled and extinguished solely in consideration for any Warrant
Cancellation Payment payable as hereinafter provided in respect of such
Warrant, so that no Warrants shall be exercisable for the purchase of Common
Shares after the Effective Time. Each Warrant shall, subject to the conditions
for the issuance of shares upon vesting as set out in such Warrant, no longer
be exercisable for the purchase of Common Shares but shall entitle each holder
thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor to payments by Company in
cash (the " _Warrant Cancellation Payment_ ") at the Effective Time equal to
the product of (i) the number of Common Shares, if any which could be
purchased under such Warrants at the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the
excess of (x) the relevant Per Common Share Merger Consideration over (y) the
per share exercise price under such Warrant. Company shall ensure that after
the Effective Time no Warrant Holder shall have any right to acquire any
capital stock of Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries. Company will ensure that neither Company nor any
Subsidiary is or will be bound by any Warrants, rights or agreements that
would entitle any Person, other than Parent or its Affiliates, to own any
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or to
receive any payment in respect thereof. After the date of this Agreement, no
further Warrants will be granted and no cash payments will be made to any
Warrant Holders in respect thereof.



2.1.4.7  _Indemnity Escrow_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2_
to the contrary, Parent shall withhold fifteen percent (15%) of the total
Merger Consideration (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ "). At the
Effective Time, in full payment of the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to Indemnity Escrow Participants, Parent shall
deliver the Indemnity Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent, who shall place the
Indemnity Escrow Amount into an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") pursuant
to an escrow agreement dated the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "),
among Parent, the escrow agent (selected by Parent and, acceptable to Company
(the " _Escrow Agent_ ")), and Company Stockholders Representatives
substantially in the form of _Exhibit H_ hereto (the Indemnity Escrow Amount,
together with the January 19 Option Escrow Amount and the Holdback
Option Cash Payment, being referred to as the " _Escrow Amount_ "). The funds
in the Escrow Account shall thereafter be released to Indemnity Escrow
Participants, January 19 Option Holders and Executives, as the case may be
only as provided in _Sections 2.1.4.5(b)_ and _(c)_ , _Section 2.1.4.7(b)_
and _Section 7_ hereof and the Escrow Agreement.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Escrow Agreement (including the retention of funds related to unresolved
claims) on the Anniversary Date, an amount equal to (i) one-half ( 1/2) of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount minus (ii) any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
already released to the Parent Parties as of such date, shall be released from
the Escrow Account to the Indemnity Escrow Participants pro rata based on the
amount of Merger Consideration that otherwise would have been payable to the
Indemnity Escrow Participants at Closing but was deposited into the Escrow
Account in respect of the Indemnity Escrow Amount. None of Parent, Merger Sub,
Company, or Surviving Corporation shall be responsible to the former Company
Stockholders, Warrant Holders, or Option Holders for any loss, damage, or
expense such holders may suffer as a result of any action of the Company
Stockholders Representatives.



2.1.4.8 _Exclusion from Indemnity Escrow_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Company Stockholders, Warrant Holders, and Option Holders
set forth on _Exhibit I_ shall not have any of their allocable portion of the
Per Common Share Merger Consideration, the Per Preferred Share Merger
Consideration, the Warrant Cancellation Payment, or Option Cash Payment
withheld for purposes of funding the Indemnity Escrow Amount, and, subject to
_Section 2.1.4.5_ , each of them shall receive 100% of their
allocable portion of the Per Common Share Merger Consideration, the Per
Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Warrant Cancellation Payment, or
Option Cash Payment, as the case may be.



2.1.4.9 _Merger Consideration Schedule_. Company represents and warrants that
it has set forth on  _Schedule 2.1.4.9_ of Company Disclosure Letter a true
and correct calculation of the Per Common Share Merger Consideration, Per
Preferred Share Merger Consideration, Option Cash Payments, and Warrant  



 

12  Cancellation Payments with respect to Company Shares, Options and Warrants
and a true and correct schedule of the aggregate amounts payable to each
Company Stockholder, Option Holder and Warrant Holder in respect of each
class of Company Shares, Options and Warrants owned by such Company
Stockholder, Option Holder and Warrant Holder, assuming that the Closing
occurs on May 31, 2005. Company shall deliver an updated _Schedule 2.1.4.9_
one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date setting forth a true and
correct schedule of the same information calculated as of the Closing Date.
The aggregate amount payable with respect to Company Shares, Options,
Warrants and any other equity interests in Company pursuant to Section 2.1.4
shall not exceed, in any event, the Merger Consideration.



2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.



2.2.1 _Payment_. (a) Pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Company to be entered into prior to the Effective Time between
Parent and a disbursing agent to be selected by Parent (the " _Disbursing
Agent_ "), at the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall make available to
the Disbursing Agent the amount of cash equal to the Merger Consideration
less the Escrow Amount (the " _Payment Fund_ "). All payments for Company
Shares, Options, and Warrants which are made in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been made in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Shares, Options and Warrants as the case may be.



(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Disbursing Agent
to send a notice and a letter of transmittal to each holder of certificates
formerly evidencing (i) Company Shares (other than certificates representing
Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1.4.1_ and certificates
held by Company Stockholders referred to in _Section 2.3_ (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ")), (ii) Options and (iii) Warrants (collectively, the "
_Certificates_ ") advising holders of such Certificates of the effectiveness
of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Disbursing Agent such
Certificates for exchange into the Per Common Share Merger Consideration, Per
Preferred Share Merger Consideration, the Option Cash Payment or the Warrant
Cancellation Payment, as the case may be, and that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
to the Disbursing Agent of the Certificates and a duly executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents of transfer. Subject to _Section
2.1.4.5_ ,  _Section 2.1.4.7_ , _Section 2.1.4.8_ and _Section 2.1.4.9_ ,
each holder of the Certificates, upon surrender thereof to the Disbursing
Agent together with such letter of transmittal (duly executed) and any other
required documents of transfer, shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Per Common Share Merger Consideration, the Per Preferred Share
Merger Consideration, the Option Cash Payment or the Warrant Cancellation
Payment, as the case may be. Upon such surrender, the Disbursing Agent shall
promptly deliver the merger consideration due hereunder (less any applicable
withholding tax) in accordance with the instructions set forth in the related
letter of transmittal, and the Certificates so surrendered shall promptly be
canceled. Until surrendered, the Certificates (other than those evidencing
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right
to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration due hereunder, or, in the
case of Dissenting Shares, the right to receive payment pursuant to the
Corporate Law if such holder of Dissenting Shares has validly perfected and
not withdrawn such right pursuant to the Corporate Law. No interest shall
accrue or be paid on any merger consideration upon the surrender of the
Certificates (other than Dissenting Shares to the extent required by the
Corporate Law). To the extent practicable, and upon surrender of Certificates
to the Disbursing Agent together with a duly executed letter of transmittal
and any other required documents of transfer, Parent will instruct the
Disbursing Agent to accommodate payment requests of holders of the
Certificates on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the respective accounts of such holders.



(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration due hereunder is to be
delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a condition to
the payment of such portion of the Merger Consideration that the Certificates
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate powers
and otherwise in proper form for transfer, that such transfer otherwise be
proper and that the Person requesting such transfer pay to the Disbursing
Agent any transfer or other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or
establish to the satisfaction of the Disbursing Agent that such Taxes have
been paid or are not required to be paid.



 

13 (d) Unless required otherwise by applicable Laws, any portion of the Payment
Fund that remains undistributed to holders of the Certificates 180 days after
the Effective Time (including any interest thereon or earnings or profits with
respect thereto) shall be delivered to the Party who provided such funds to
the Disbursing Agent, and any Certificate holder who has not theretofore
complied with the provisions of this _Section 2_ , shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation for payment of such portion of any Merger
Consideration due hereunder, to which he is entitled pursuant to this
_Section 2_ , but shall have no greater rights against the Surviving
Corporation or Parent than may be accorded to general creditors of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent under applicable Laws. Neither Parent nor
the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any such Certificate holder for any
cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



2.2.2 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, holders of Certificates previously evidencing Company Shares
shall cease to have any rights as Company Stockholders, except as provided
herein or by law.



2.2.3 _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate has been
lost, stolen, or destroyed, Parent will issue the applicable Per Common Share
Merger Consideration, Per Preferred Share Merger Consideration, Option Cash
Payment or Warrant Cancellation Payment, as the case may be, deliverable in
respect thereof upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and (ii) if Parent
or the Surviving Corporation requires, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate.



 

2.3 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Any Company Shares that a Company
Stockholder properly exercising its dissent or appraisal rights under the
applicable Corporate Law (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") holds will be
converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to
be due to such Dissenting Stockholder under the applicable Corporate
Law; except that Company Shares with respect to which, after the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand to exercise dissenters
or appraisal rights or loses its right to exercise dissenters or appraisal
rights as provided in the applicable Corporate Law, will be deemed to be
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable
Per Common Share Merger Consideration or Per Preferred Share Merger
Consideration, as the case may be. Company will give Parent (a) prompt notice
of any written demands for the exercise of dissenters or appraisal rights,
withdrawals of demands for the exercise of dissenters or appraisal rights and
any other instruments served under the applicable Corporate Law, and (b) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for exercise of dissenters or appraisal rights under the applicable Corporate
Law. Company will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
purchase demands and will not, except with Parents prior written consent,
settle or offer to settle any such demands.

Intellectual Property is used under license in the business of Company or any
Subsidiary, no notice of a material default has been sent or received by
Company or any Subsidiary under any such license which remains uncured and
the execution, delivery or performance of the obligations herein and
consummation of the transaction contemplated hereunder will not result in such
a default. To the Knowledge of Company, each such license agreement is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto and enforceable in
accordance with the terms thereof.

not any such plans, programs, arrangements, commitments, contracts, agreements
and/or practices (referred to in (i), (ii) or (iii) above) are in writing or
are otherwise exempt from the provisions of ERISA; that have been established,
maintained, or contributed to (or with respect to which an obligation to
contribute has been undertaken) or with respect to which any potential
liability is borne by Company or any of the Subsidiaries (including, for this
purpose and for the purpose of all of the representations in this _Section
4.21_ , any predecessors to Company or to any of the Subsidiaries and
all employers (whether or not incorporated) that would be treated together
with Company, any of the Subsidiaries and/or Company Stockholders as a single
employer (1) within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code, or (2) as a result
of Company or any Subsidiary and/or any Company Stockholders being or having
been a general partner of any such employer), since September 2, 1974 ("
_Employee Benefit Plans_ ").



(b) _Status of Plans_. Each Employee Benefit Plan (including any related
trust) complies in form with the requirements of all applicable Laws,
including, without limitation, ERISA, the Code, and foreign tax, labor,
securities, data privacy, currency exchange control and other Laws, and has at
all times been maintained and operated in substantial compliance with
its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including, without
limitation, ERISA and the Code. No complete or partial termination of any
Employee Benefit Plan has occurred or is expected to occur. Neither Company
nor any of the Subsidiaries has any commitment, intention or understanding to
create, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan. Except as required to
maintain the tax-qualified status of any Employee Benefit Plan intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, no condition or circumstance exists
that would prevent the amendment or termination of any Employee Benefit Plan
without liability (other than liability (i) for ordinary administrative
expenses typically incurred in connection with amending or terminating such
an Employee Benefit Plan or (ii) for which sufficient assets are set aside in
a trust or insurance contract to satisfy such liabilities or which are
reflected on Companys balance sheet constituting part of the
Financial Statements). No event has occurred and no condition or circumstance
has existed that could result in a material increase in the benefits under or
the expense of maintaining any Employee Benefit Plan from the level of
benefits or expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year ended thereof.



(c) _No Pension Plans_. No Employee Benefit Plan is an "employee pension
benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA. Neither Company nor any
of the Subsidiaries has ever maintained or contributed to, or had any
obligation to contribute to (or borne any liability with respect to) any
"multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of the Code or ERISA) or any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).



(d) _Liabilities_. Neither Company nor any of the Subsidiaries maintains any
Employee Benefit Plan which is (a) a "group health plan" (as such term is
defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or Section 607(1) of ERISA) that has
not been administered and operated in all respects in compliance with the
applicable requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code or (b) a "group health plan" (as defined in 45 Code
of Federal Regulations Section 160.103) that has not been administered and
operated in all respects in compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, and neither Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries is subject to any material liability, including, without
limitation, additional contributions, fines, Taxes, penalties or loss of tax
deduction as a result of such administration and operation. No Employee
Benefit Plan which is such a group health plan is a "multiple employer
welfare arrangement," within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. Each
Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 125
of the Code meets such  



 

28  requirements, and each program of benefits for which employee contributions
are provided pursuant to elections under any Employee Benefit Plan meets
the requirements of the Code applicable thereto. Neither Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries maintains any Employee Benefit Plan which is an "employee
welfare benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) that
has provided any "disqualified benefit" (as such term is defined in Section
4976(b) of the Code) with respect to which an excise tax could be imposed.



Neither Company nor any of the Subsidiaries maintains any Employee Benefit
Plan (whether qualified or non-qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code) providing for post-employment or retiree health, life insurance and/or
other welfare benefits and having unfunded liabilities, and neither Company
nor any of the Subsidiaries have any obligation to provide any such benefits
to any retired or former employees or active employees following such
employees retirement or termination of service. Neither Company nor any of
the Subsidiaries has any unfunded liabilities pursuant to any Employee Benefit
Plan that is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.
No Employee Benefit Plan holds as an asset any interest in any annuity
contract, guaranteed investment contract or any other investment or insurance
contract, policy or instrument issued by an insurance company that, to the
Knowledge of Company, is or may be the subject of bankruptcy, conservatorship,
insolvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or similar proceedings.



Neither Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has incurred any liability for any
Tax or excise Tax arising under Chapter 43 of the Code, and no event
has occurred and no condition or circumstance has existed that could give
rise to any such liability.



There are no actions, suits, claims or disputes pending, or, to the Knowledge
of Company, threatened, anticipated or expected to be asserted against
or with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or the assets of any such plan
(other than routine claims for benefits and appeals of denied routine claims).
No civil or criminal action brought pursuant to the provisions of Title I,
Subtitle B, Part 5 of ERISA is pending, threatened, anticipated, or expected
to be asserted against Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any fiduciary of
any Employee Benefit Plan, in any case with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan. No condition exists which presents a material risk to Company or any of
the Subsidiaries of incurring a liability (other than for routine benefit
payments) to or on account of an Employee Benefit Plan. No Employee Benefit
Plan or any fiduciary thereof has been the direct or indirect subject of an
audit, investigation or examination by any governmental or quasi-governmental
agency.



(e) _Contributions_. Full payment has been timely made of all amounts which
Company or any of the Subsidiaries is required, under applicable law or under
any Employee Benefit Plan or any agreement relating to any Employee Benefit
Plan to which Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party, to have paid as
contributions or premiums thereto as of the last day of the most recent fiscal
year of such Employee Benefit Plan ended prior to the date hereof and as of
the Closing Date, and such contributions or premiums have been timely
deposited into the appropriate trusts or accounts. All such contributions
and/or premiums have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such
deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any governmental entity, and to
the Knowledge of Company and the Subsidiaries no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance has existed that could give rise to any such
challenge or disallowance. Company has made adequate provision for reserves to
meet contributions and premiums and any other liabilities that have not been
paid or satisfied because they are not yet due under the terms of
any Employee Benefit Plan, applicable law or related agreements. Benefits
under all Employee Benefit Plans are as represented and have not been
increased subsequent to the date as of which documents have been provided.



(f) _Tax Qualification_. Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has, as currently in effect, either been
determined to be so qualified by the Internal Revenue Service or is a
prototype plan which has a determination letter. Each trust established in
connection with any Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to be exempt from
Federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has, as currently in
effect, been determined to be so exempt by the Internal Revenue Service. Each
VEBA has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from
Federal income tax under Section 501(c)(9) of the  



 

29  Code. Since the date of each most recent determination referred to in this
paragraph (f), no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance has
existed that resulted or is likely to result in the revocation of any such
determination or that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Employee Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust or VEBA.



(g) _Transactions_. Neither Company nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective directors, officers, employees or, to the Knowledge of
Company and the Subsidiaries, other persons who participate in the operation
of any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust or funding vehicle, has engaged
in any transaction with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or breached any
applicable fiduciary responsibilities or obligations under Title I of ERISA
that would subject any of them to a Tax, penalty or liability for prohibited
transactions or breach of any obligations under ERISA or the Code or would
result in any claim being made under, by or on behalf of any such Employee
Benefit Plan by any party with standing to make such claim.



(h) _Triggering Events_. Except as specifically set forth in Schedule 4.21(h)
of Company Disclosure Letter, including as to any applicable employee and
amount of any "parachute payment" and "excess parachute payment" (as such
terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code) to any such employee, the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, do not constitute a triggering event under any Employee
Benefit Plan, policy, arrangement, statement, commitment or agreement, whether
or not legally enforceable, which (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent event) will or may result in any payment (whether of
severance pay or otherwise), "parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G of the Code), acceleration, vesting or increase in benefits to
any employee or former employee or director of Company or any of the
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.21(h)_ of Company Disclosure
Letter, no Employee Benefit Plan provides for the payment of severance,
termination, change in control or similar type payments or benefits.



(i)  _Classification_. Company and the Subsidiaries have classified all
individuals who perform services for them correctly under each Employee
Benefit Plan, ERISA, the Code and other applicable law as common law
employees, independent contractors or leased employees.



(j) _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation_. Each "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) that
Company is a party to has been operated since January 1, 2005 in compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice 2005-1. Except as expressly set
forth on Company Disclosure Letter, no nonqualified deferred compensation plan
has been "materially modified" (within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1) at
any time after October 3, 2004. No event has occurred that would be treated
by Section 409A(b) of the Code as a transfer of property for purposes of
Section 83 of the Code.



(k) _Documents_. Company Stockholders have delivered or caused to be delivered
to Parent and its counsel true and complete copies of all material documents
in connection with each Employee Benefit Plan, including, without limitation
(where applicable): (i) all Employee Benefit Plans as in effect on the date
hereof, together with all amendments thereto, including, in the case of any
Employee Benefit Plan not set forth in writing, a written description
thereof; (ii) all current summary plan descriptions, summaries of material
modifications, and material communications; (iii) all current trust
agreements, declarations of trust and other documents establishing other
funding arrangements (and all amendments thereto and the latest financial

relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the breach, subject to the
restrictions contained in  _Sections 7.5_ , _7.6_ , and _7.7_ herein.



7.4  _Matters Involving Third Parties_.



7.4.1 If any third party shall notify any Parent Indemnitee or Stockholder
Indemnitee (" _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter (other than a
Tax matter which shall be governed by _Section 7.4.4_ ) which may give rise
to a claim for indemnification (" _Third Party Claim_ ") against any other
Party (" _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this _Section 7_ , then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof, in writing
stating the nature and basis of such claims and the amount thereof, to the
extent known; provided that (a) if any of the Parent Indemnitees is the
Indemnified Party, such Parent Indemnitee shall satisfy its notice obligation
by promptly notifying Company Stockholders Representatives, and (b) if any
of the Stockholder Indemnitees is the Indemnified Party, then Company
Stockholders Representatives shall satisfy its notice obligation by promptly
notifying Parent;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party in accordance with the
notice provisions of _Sections 7.2_ or _7.3_ above or this _Section 7.4.1_
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless
(and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby.



7.4.2 Any Indemnifying Party will have the right by notifying the Indemnified
Party in writing to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel
of his or her or its choice, at such Indemnifying  



 

41  Partys sole cost and expense, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party at any time within thirty (30) days (or within a shorter period of
time, as may be required by notice of a Third Party Claim), after the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its
rights in this regard, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel
chosen by such Indemnified Party, provided that the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party and (iii) the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly be entitled to assume the defense of such action only to
the extent the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its indemnity obligation and
assumes and holds such Indemnified Party harmless from and against the full
amount of any Loss resulting therefrom; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such
defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party if: (i) such third party claim could reasonably be expected
to give rise to Losses which are more than 150% of the amount indemnifiable by
such Indemnifying Party; (ii) the claim for indemnification relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; (iii) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party; (iv) the Indemnified Party has been
advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; (v) the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse determination with
respect to the action, lawsuit, investigation, proceeding or other claim
giving rise to such claim for indemnification would be detrimental to or
injure the Indemnified Partys reputation or future business prospects; or
(vi) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules that
the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such claim. So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any
such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any
such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to pay or settle any such claim, _provided_ that in such event it
shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying Party for
such claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall have consented to such payment
or settlement. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice
of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense
thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or
compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity
therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except
with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or
consent to entry of any judgment that is not entirely indemnifiable by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 7_ and does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such
claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all
liability with respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects
in connection with the defense of any claim, including making available
records relating to such claim and furnishing, without expense to
the Indemnifying Party and/or its counsel, such employees of the Indemnified
Party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of any
such claim or for testimony as witnesses in any proceeding relating to such
claim.



7.4.3 In the event that none of the Indemnifying Parties assumes and conducts
the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section 7.4.2_ above,
however, (a) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third
Party Claim in any manner he or it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the
Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, any
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith) and (b) the Indemnifying Party
will remain responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this _Section 7_.



7.4.4 (a) Parent shall notify Company Stockholders Representatives upon
receipt by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (including Surviving Corporation
and the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) of written notice of any
inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to
Taxes relating to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date for
which Company may be liable under this Agreement (any such inquiry, claim,
assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ "). Company  



 

42  Stockholders Representatives, at their sole expense, shall have the
authority to represent the interests of Surviving Corporation and the
Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Matter before the Internal Revenue
Service, any other taxing authority, any other Governmental Authority and
shall have the sole right to control the defense, compromise or other
resolution of any Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax
Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, a Tax Matter; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of Company
Stockholders Representatives, Company Stockholders, or any of their
respective Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any Tax Matter that adversely affects or may adversely affect the
Tax liability of Parent, Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any Affiliate
of the foregoing for any period ending after the Closing Date, including the
portion of the Overlap Period that is after the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Company Stockholders Representatives shall keep Parent
fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature
of any Tax Matter. Parent shall be permitted to make comments to Company
Stockholders Representatives, regarding the conduct of or positions taken in
any such proceeding.



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.4.4(a)_ above, Parent shall
have the sole right to control any audit or examination by any taxing
authority, initiate any claim for refund or amend any Tax Return, and contest,
resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax
deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, the income,
assets or operations of Company (or Surviving Corporation) and the
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including Surviving Corporation and
the Subsidiaries) not to, enter into any settlement of any contest or
otherwise compromise any issue with respect to the portion of the Overlap
Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Company Stockholders Representatives, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.



7.5 _Threshold and Cap_. No Indemnifying Party shall have any obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any Losses resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the breach of
any representation or warranty of the Indemnifying Party until the
Indemnified Party has suffered Losses by reason of all such breaches in excess
of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) in the aggregate (the "
_Deductible_ "), after which point the Indemnifying Party will be obligated
only to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any Losses above the
Deductible. Furthermore, the aggregate dollar amount of all payments that any
Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to make to the Indemnified Party with
respect to Losses arising out of or related to any breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement (excluding, for this purpose, any
Stockholder Support Agreement) or the failure of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement (excluding, for this purpose, any Stockholder
Support Agreement) to be true, shall not exceed the amount then currently in
the Escrow Account.



7.6 _Escrow_. The Indemnity Escrow Amount will be available to compensate the
Parent Indemnitees for any claims of indemnification they have under this
_Section 7_ and amounts shall be released therefrom pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the
Parent Indemnitees sole recourse for any breaches of any representations or
warranties in this Agreement (excluding, for this purpose, any Stockholder
Support Agreement).



7.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud or willful breach, Parent
and Company each acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing indemnification
provisions in this _Section 7_ shall, from and after the Closing Date, be the
exclusive remedy of Parent and Company Stockholders with respect to Losses
arising out of or related to any breach of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement (excluding, for this purpose, any Stockholder Support
Agreement) or the failure of any representation or warranty in this Agreement
(excluding, for this purpose, any Stockholder Support Agreement) to be true.

inquiry, and until the receipt of written notice of a change of any of Company

permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation as between the parties directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or

hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence.



11.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any

substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a reasonably
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



11.12 _Expenses_. Any fees or costs (including legal) incurred by the Parties
in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated

negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state,

and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without limitation.

warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, may be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising
because of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.



11.15 _Incorporation of Exhibits, Annexes, and Schedules_. The Exhibits,
Annexes, and Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof.

11.17 _Electronic Signatures_.



11.17.1 Notwithstanding the Electronic Signatures in Global and National
Commerce Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 7001  _et seq._ ), the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act, or any other Law relating to or enabling the creation,
execution, delivery, or recordation of any Contract or signature by electronic
means, and notwithstanding any course of conduct engaged in by the Parties,
no Party will be deemed to have executed this Agreement or other document
contemplated hereby (including any amendment or other change thereto) unless
and until such Party shall have executed the Agreement or other document
on paper by a handwritten Original Signature or any other symbol executed or
adopted by a Party with current intention to authenticate such document.

Original Signature by facsimile transmission (whether directly from one
facsimile device to another by means of a dial-up connection or whether
mediated by the worldwide web), by electronic mail in "portable document
format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve
the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the
same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the Original
Signature. " _Originally Signed_ " or " _Original Signature_ " means or
refers to a signature that has not been mechanically or electronically
reproduced.



11.18 _Further Assurances_. At any time after the Closing any further action
is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties
will take such further and commercially reasonable action (including the
execution of further instruments and documents) as any other Party, including
Company Stockholders Representatives on behalf of Company, reasonably may
request. 



11.19 _Entire Agreement_. With the exception of that certain Confidentiality
Agreement, by and between Company and Parent, and dated as of February 18,
2005, which shall remain in effect, this Agreement, including all schedules,
exhibits and other documents referred to herein, constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements, or representations by or among the Parties, written or oral, to
the extent they related in any way to the subject matter hereof and may not be
modified, amended, or terminated except in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

executed by their respective authorized officers as of the date first above
written.
