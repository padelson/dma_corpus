(x) all Liabilities arising out of or relating to the matters listed on
_Schedule 2.5(a)(x)_ ;

 

(xi) all fees, costs, charges and other expenses payable by Sellers or for
which Sellers are liable in connection with or triggered by the transactions
completed hereby, including (A) any transaction, retention or change in
control bonus payment or deferred compensation payable by Sellers in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the employer portion of any payroll Taxes associated therewith,
and (B) any severance resulting from any termination of employment prior to
the Closing and the employer portion of any payroll Taxes
associated therewith; and

 



-16- (xii) all fees and expenses or other Liabilities of Sellers or
Shareholders or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to accounting,
investment banking, banking and other professional counsel in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each of Purchasers and Sellers obligations under this _Section_ __ _
2.5_ will not be subject to offset or reduction by reason of any actual or
alleged breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or any of the Other Transaction Documents or any right or alleged
right to indemnification hereunder. 

SECTION 2.6. _Consents to Assignment_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or any Other Transaction Document, to
the extent that the Transfer to Purchaser of any asset that would be an
Acquired Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
Governmental Entity or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or
waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not
have been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed without
the Transfer of such asset, claim, right or benefit unless such failure
causes a failure of any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article_ __
_ IX_, in which event the Closing shall proceed only if the failed condition
is waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof (in such
Parties sole discretion). In the event that the Closing proceeds without the
Transfer of any such asset, claim, right or benefit, then (i) such asset,
claim, right or benefit shall to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
except in the case of any Account that is prohibited from being Transferred,
be regarded as an Acquired Asset for purposes of determining the Closing Net
Funds Employed and (ii) for a period of eighteen (18) months following the
Closing, the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts, and cooperate
with each other, to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers. Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, Sellers
and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable,
reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide to Purchaser the
benefits of use of such asset, claim, right or benefit and to Sellers or
their Affiliates the benefits, including any indemnities, that Sellers would
have obtained had the asset, claim, right or benefit been Transferred to
Purchaser at the Closing. Once authorization, approval, consent or waiver for
the Transfer of any such asset, claim, right or benefit not Transferred at
the Closing is obtained, Sellers shall or shall cause their relevant
Affiliates to, Transfer such asset, claim, right or benefit to Purchaser (and
to the extent such asset is an Account, Purchaser shall thereupon pay to
Sellers the Closing Net Funds Employed that would have been associated with
such Account had such Account been Transferred at the Closing). To the extent
that any such asset, claim, right or benefit cannot be Transferred or the
full benefits of use of any such asset, claim, right or benefit cannot be
provided to Purchaser following the Closing pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.6_, then Purchaser and Sellers shall enter into mutually agreeable
arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide
to the Parties the economic (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and
operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of obtaining such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the performance by Purchaser
of the obligations thereunder. Sellers shall hold in trust for and pay to
Purchaser promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies
received by Sellers or any of its Affiliates in connection with

 



-17-  its use of any asset, claim, right or benefit in connection with the
arrangements under this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. To the extent (x) Sellers are
contractually entitled to terminate any contract to be Transferred hereunder
that is prohibited from being Transferred, and has not been Transferred,
hereunder to Purchaser and (y) Purchaser requests in writing that Sellers
exercise their right to terminate such contract, Sellers shall exercise their
option to terminate such contract; _provided_ that Purchaser shall bear any
and all early termination expenses due under the terms of such contract in
connection with the exercise of such option to terminate.

SECTION 2.7. _Financing Statements_. Sellers agree that, following the
Closing, Sellers and their Affiliates will not exercise any rights as secured
party of record with respect to financing statements under the uniform
commercial code or other similar statutes with respect to the Acquired Assets
without the prior written consent of Purchaser and will cooperate with
Purchaser as reasonably requested by Purchaser to amend any such financing
statements in the manner requested by Purchaser.

 

SECTION 2.8. _Refunds and Remittances_.

 

(a) _Received by Seller_. After the Closing, if Sellers receive any refund
or other amount in respect of an Acquired Asset or that is otherwise properly
due and owing to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Sellers promptly shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to
Purchaser.

 

(b) _Received by Purchaser or its Affiliates_. After the Closing, if
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives any refund or other amount in
respect of an Excluded Asset or that is otherwise properly due and owing to
Sellers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Purchaser promptly
shall remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to Sellers. 

SECTION 2.9. _Mistakenly Transferred Assets_. After the Closing, if any
Party discovers that an Excluded Asset was Transferred by Sellers to
Purchaser or its Affiliate, or that an Acquired Asset was retained by Sellers
or any of its Affiliates or otherwise not Transferred to Purchaser ("
_Mistakenly Transferred Assets_ "), Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be,
shall:

(a) notify the Party entitled to such Mistakenly Transferred Asset under
this Agreement and, at such Partys request, take all such further action
required to Transfer the Mistakenly Transferred Asset to such Party or its
Affiliate, including any rights and obligations related thereto;

 

(b) hold the Mistakenly Transferred Asset in trust for the Party entitled
to such Mistakenly Transferred Asset under this Agreement or its Affiliate
until such time that such Mistakenly Transferred Asset is Transferred to such

(c) pay to the Party entitled to such Mistakenly Transferred Asset under
this Agreement or its Affiliate all amounts collected by or paid to the other
Party by third parties in respect of the Mistakenly Transferred Asset;

and payable to such Party or its Affiliate in and under such Mistakenly
Transferred Asset are received by such Party or its Affiliate;

its Affiliates; and

 

(f) if required, enforce, at the request of the Party entitled to such
Mistakenly Transferred Asset under this Agreement or its Affiliate and at the
expense and for the account of Sellers or their Affiliate, any rights of such
Party or its Affiliate under or arising from the Mistakenly Transferred Asset
against any third party.

Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers (i) a Data Tape reflecting the
Account Contracts as of 11:59 P.M. Mountain time on the Business Day prior to

the Foreign Cash Amount and the Prepaids Amount, in each case determined in a
manner consistent and in accordance with the Accounting Principles and based
on the Closing Data Tape.

(b) _Disputed Final Adjustment_.

 

(i) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties
on the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof, unless Sellers deliver
written notice to Purchaser prior to such date of its disagreement with
preparation or content of the Closing Statement, including any disagreement
with any balances or other amounts reflected in the Closing Data Tape (a "
_Notice of Disagreement_ "). During such thirty (30)-day period, Sellers and

Statement and the Closing Data Tape and to Purchasers auditor and
representatives who prepared the Closing Statement and the Closing Data Tape.
A Notice of Disagreement must describe in reasonable detail the items
contained in the Closing Statement that Sellers dispute and the basis for any
such disputes. During the thirty (30)-day period following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, Sellers and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and seek to agree on a final
determination of the Closing Net Funds Employed, the Foreign Cash Amount and

agreement on the Closing Net Funds Employed, the Foreign Cash Amount and the
Prepaids Amount has been reached, Sellers and Purchaser shall engage a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the " _Accounting Firm_ ")
for arbitration of any and all matters that remain in dispute and were
properly included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Accounting Firm shall be
Grant Thornton LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed
upon by the Parties in writing. As promptly as

 



-21-  practicable after the engagement of the Accounting Firm, Sellers shall
submit any unresolved elements set forth in the Notice of Disagreement to the
Accounting Firm in writing (with a copy to Purchaser), supported by any
documents and arguments upon which they rely. As promptly as practicable
thereafter, Purchaser shall submit its response to the Accounting Firm (with a
copy to Sellers) supported by any documents and arguments upon which it
relies. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm to render its reasoned
written decision with respect to each disagreement asserted in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)(i)_ as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than thirty (30) days after submission of all matters in dispute.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is
to be enforced.

(ii) Notwithstanding any provisions hereof to the contrary, the Accounting
Firm shall be deemed to be acting as an expert and not as an arbiter and the
proceeding before the Accounting Firm shall be an expert determination under
the law governing expert determination. None of Sellers or Purchaser shall
have any _ex parte_  communications with the Accounting Firm without the
prior consent of Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be. The Accounting Firm
shall review such submissions and base its determination solely on the
submissions made by Sellers and Purchaser, the terms of this Agreement and
the Accounting Principles. In resolving any disputed item submitted to the
Accounting Firm, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value claimed for such item by either Purchaser or
Sellers or less than the smallest value claimed for such item by either
Purchaser or Sellers and such resolution shall be in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.2_. 

(iii) In the event Purchaser and Sellers submit any unresolved objections
to the Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in _Section_ __ _
3.2(b)(i)_, the cost of any dispute resolution (including the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of
the Parties) shall be borne by Purchaser and Sellers in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocations also shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at
the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits
of the matters submitted.

(iv) For purposes of complying with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, Purchaser
and Sellers shall provide each other and the others auditors reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, contracts,
books and records relating to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the

(c) _Payment Following Adjustment_. The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall
be equal to (a) the Final Closing Net Funds Employed _plus_ (b) the Closing
Premium _plus_ (c) the Final Foreign Cash Amount _plus_ (d) the Final Prepaids
Amount _minus _ (e) the Estimated Total Post-Closing Bonus Payment. If the
Base Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay
to Seller, and if the Base Purchase Price is more than the Final Purchase
Price, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser, in each case, within ten (10) Business
Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties, by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, the amount of such difference.

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through
and including the ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause ICC to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect
the At Risk Client Balances.

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the ninety (90)-day

debtors) is in default in any material respect under any Contract related to
or affecting the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and
to which any Seller is a party or otherwise bound, nor has any event or
omission occurred that, through the passage of time or the giving of notice,
or both, would constitute a default in any material respect thereunder, or
give rise to an automatic termination or the right of discretionary
termination thereof. Each Contract related to or affecting the Business, the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities and to which any Seller is a party
or otherwise bound is in full force and effect and is a valid and
binding agreement enforceable against such Seller and the other party or
parties thereto in accordance with its terms.

(using the actuarial methods and assumptions then used by the Group
Companies actuaries in connection with the funding of such Employee
Plan/Agreement).

SECTION 6.1. _Access_ _; Cooperation, etc_.

 

(a) _Pre-Closing Access to Information_. From the date hereof to
the Closing, Sellers shall give Purchaser and its representatives, employees,
counsel and accountants reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the Acquired Assets (including the
Transferred Records) and the Assumed Liabilities and any records directly or
indirectly related thereto and to make copes and extracts therefor at
Purchasers own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access (i) does
not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Seller or the Business and
(ii) would not be reasonably expected to violate any attorney-client privilege
of Seller or violate any applicable Law; _provided_ that, in the case that the
foregoing clause (ii) restricts the rights of Purchaser under this _Section_
__ _ 6.1(a)_, Sellers and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts
to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements that do not impair any
such attorney-client privilege or violate any applicable Law.

(b) _Post-Closing Access to Information_. After the Closing, for a period
of six (6) years after the Closing Date, each Party shall afford any other
Party, its respective counsel, accountants and other representatives, during
normal business hours, reasonable access to the books, records and other data
in such Partys possession relating directly or indirectly to the assets,
Liabilities or operations of the Sellers with respect to periods prior to the
Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom at its expense,
to the extent such access is reasonably required by the requesting Party for
any proper business purpose. Without limitation, after the Closing, each Party
shall make available to any other Party, as reasonably requested, and to any
Tax authority that is legally permitted to receive the following pursuant to
its subpoena power or its equivalent, all books, records and other data
relating to Tax Liabilities or potential Tax Liabilities for all periods prior
to or including the Closing Date and shall preserve all such books, records
and other data until the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations
for assessment or refund of Taxes or extensions thereof. Notwithstanding the
obligations contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, no Party shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of it or its
Affiliates or contravene any applicable Law or binding agreement; _provided_
that, in the case that the foregoing restricts the rights of any Party under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, Sellers and Purchaser shall use their reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements that do
not impair any such attorney-client privilege or violate any applicable Law.
The Parties hereto

 



-46-  will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances
in which the restrictions of the previous sentence apply. Subject to the
previous sentence, each Party agrees, for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, not to destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the books, records
or other data described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ without first offering
in writing to surrender such books, records and other data to the other
Parties, which other Parties shall have ten (10) days after such offer to
agree in writing to take possession thereof.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. Each Party shall cooperate, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with (i) the filing of
Tax Returns and (ii) any Litigation (including insurance claims) brought by or
against any third party in connection with (A) any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement or (B) any fact or condition relating to AFICs business or
assets. Such cooperation shall include making available to the requesting
Party, at such times and under such circumstances so as not to unreasonably
disrupt business, the relevant information, documents, records and employees
of the cooperating Party, allowing the relevant personnel of the cooperating
Party to assist the requesting Party in participating in any such matter
(including providing testimony in Litigation), executing and delivering
documents or instruments and taking all such action as the requesting Party
reasonably requests in connection with such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the requesting Party shall promptly reimburse the cooperating Party
for all out-of-pocket costs, for a pro-rata portion of the salary (including
fringe benefits with such pro-rata portion determined based upon the time
spent in connection with cooperation) and for travel and subsistence expenses
directly relating to such cooperation of any of the cooperating
Partys employees who assist the requesting Party (unless the contesting or
defending party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article_ __ _
XI_). The Sellers and Shareholders agree, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser, to use their respective reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or other Person
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).
Purchaser and the Sellers and Shareholders further agree, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, to provide such other Party with all
information that any Party may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043
of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (if any).

 

(d) _Consultation with Advisors_. The Sellers consent to Purchasers
consultation with legal, accounting and other professional advisors to the

contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ and each provision hereof are
severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions
hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other
jurisdiction.

 

(c) The parties intend for the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_: (i)
to accompany the transfer of the Personal Goodwill being transferred
contemporaneously with and in conjunction with the Acquisition; (ii) to have
the function primarily of assuring to Purchaser the beneficial enjoyment of
the Personal Goodwill which Purchaser is acquiring hereunder; and (iii) to be
regarded as non-severable from and as being in effect a contributing element

be construed in accordance with this intent.

SECTION 6.6. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall

party receiving confidential information thereunder, and each Seller and each
Shareholder agrees to keep confidential all information concerning Purchaser

(b) Sellers and Shareholders shall, and shall cause their Affiliates and
Representatives to, treat confidentially, except to the extent requested or

Affiliates furnished to it by Purchaser or its Affiliates or Representatives
( _provided_ that Information of or relating to the Acquired Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities shall from and after the Closing be considered Information
concerning Purchaser furnished to Sellers and Shareholders by Purchaser)
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except to the extent that such information was
(x) previously known by Sellers, Shareholders or their Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis ( _provided_ that this clause (x) shall not apply to
Information of or relating to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or
the Business for any period through the Closing), (y) in the public domain
through no breach of Sellers, Shareholders or any of their Affiliates of this
Agreement or (z) later lawfully acquired from other sources by Sellers,
Shareholders or their Affiliates), and Sellers and Shareholders shall not,
and shall cause their Affiliates not to, release or disclose such Information
to any other Person, except their Representatives with a duty of
confidentiality and, to the extent permitted above, any Governmental Entity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,

 



-52-  nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall limit the right of Sellers,

Transaction Documents) is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement between Purchaser Parent and ICC, dated as of March 3, 2017 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the confidentiality
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to
information to the extent relating to the Acquired Assets and Assumed
Liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser acknowledges that any and
all other information provided to it by Sellers, Shareholders or Sellers

Agreement after the Closing Date until it terminates in accordance with its
terms.

SECTION 6.7. _Origination in Name of Purchaser_. Sellers shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, upon the reasonable request of Purchaser and at
Purchasers sole cost and expense, take such reasonably requested actions

effective at the Closing.

 

SECTION 6.8. _Compliance by Sellers_. Each Shareholder shall cause, to the

employee relating to the conditions set forth on Section 4.10(c)(1) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. At any time through and including the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the right to
give notice to the Sellers of Purchasers election to terminate the lease with

Affiliates if substantially simultaneously Purchaser or one if its Affiliates
agrees to lease a substantially equivalent amount of contiguous space at the
Texas Facility under the lease with respect to the Texas Facility and to pay
for such additional space an aggregate total cost substantially equivalent to
the cost under the terminated lease with respect to the New Mexico Facility.
Any notice hereunder given by Purchaser shall

 



-53-  set forth the date of termination of the lease with respect to the New
Mexico Facility and the date of commencement of occupancy of the additional
space under the lease with respect to the Texas Facility, which dates shall

be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any securities
exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or announcement
shall allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that each
of Sellers and Purchaser may make internal announcements to their respective
employees after reasonable prior notice to and consultation with the other.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Parties shall cooperate to prepare a
joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date, and (b) Sellers and

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_, from time
to time after the Closing, and for no further consideration, AFIC and AFIC II
shall, and shall cause their

take such action as may reasonably requested by Purchaser to consummate more
effectively the intent and purpose of the Parties under this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including transferring to
Purchaser any Acquired Asset or any payment in respect thereof, which Acquired
Asset or payment was contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to
Purchaser at or prior to the Closing which was not so transferred, or which is
held or received by AFIC, AFIC II or any of their respective affiliates after
the Closing.

required or reasonably advisable for the conduct or operation of the Business
or the ownership of the Acquired Assets after the Closing, and the right to
make copies and extracts therefrom, in each case, as Purchaser may reasonably
request; _provided_ that (A) such access would not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of Sellers and their Affiliates and (B) Sellers reserve the
right to redact any information that is unrelated to the Business and Sellers
shall have no obligation to furnish (x) information the disclosure of which
is legally or contractually prohibited and (y) such portions of documents or
information which are subject to attorney-client privilege and the provision
of which, in the opinion of Sellers internal counsel, may eliminate the
privilege pertaining to such documents, _provided_ _further_ that, in the
case that the foregoing clauses (x) and (y) restricts the rights of Purchaser
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, Sellers and Purchaser shall use their
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
that do not impair any such attorney-client privilege or violate any
applicable Law or duty of confidentiality.

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

SECTION 7.1. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Sellers and Purchaser agree to
allocate and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate,
the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_)
and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax
purposes among the Acquired Assets in accordance with the allocation agreed
to pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_. No later than sixty (60) days after
the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed
allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 3.2_) and any other items that are treated as additional consideration
for Tax purposes to Purchaser as of the Closing Date, determined in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sellers  Allocation_"). If Purchaser disagrees
with Sellers Allocation, Purchaser may, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of Sellers Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Purchaser s
Allocation Notice_") to Sellers to such effect, specifying those items as to
which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchasers proposed allocation.
If Purchasers Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Sellers and Purchaser
shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2_) and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that Purchaser and Sellers do not agree on an allocation of the
Purchase Price among the Acquired Assets, Purchaser and Sellers shall each be
entitled to take any reasonable position with respect thereto.

SECTION 7.2. _Entitlement to Tax Refunds and Credits_. Sellers shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes resulting from the overpayment of
any Excluded Tax Liability.

 



-56- SECTION 7.3. _Straddle Periods_. In the case of a Tax imposed in respect
of property or any other Tax that applies ratably to a tax period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
amount of Tax allocable to a portion of the Straddle Period shall be the
total amount of such Tax for the period in question multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the total number of days in such portion of such
Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
such Straddle Period. In the case of any Taxes other than _ad valorem_
property Taxes or other Taxes that apply ratably to a Tax period, the amount
of Tax allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period shall be computed as if the Pre-Closing Tax Period ended as of the end
of the day on the Closing Date.

 

SECTION 7.4. _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne and paid
solely by Sellers. Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of
any available reduction or exemption from any such Transfer Taxes, and to
cooperate with the other Party in timely providing any information and
documentation that may be necessary to obtain such reductions or exemptions
or to make any filings relating to Transfer Taxes. The Party responsible under
applicable Law for making any Transfer Tax filings shall make such filings and
promptly provide evidence of such payment to the other Party to
obtain reimbursement, if applicable.

provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the terms and conditions of
Purchasers offer of employment to each Employee listed on Section 9.2(f) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be governed solely by the employment
agreement between such Employee and Purchaser. Each Employee who accepts the
offer of employment from Purchaser and its Affiliates and actually commences
employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof is referred to herein as
a " _Transferred Employee_."

 



-57- SECTION 8.2. _COBRA_. Following the Closing, the Sellers shall retain all
Liability to provide health care continuation coverage under Section 4980B of

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall ensure that
they make such coverage available to the MandA Qualified Beneficiaries for the

coverage to any of such MandA Qualified Beneficiaries.

 

SECTION 8.3. _Employee Bonuses_. Section 8.3 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of Employees entitled to a
bonus in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each
a " _Qualified Employee_ ") and the amount of such bonus (a) payable on the
Closing Date (each, a " _Closing Bonus_ " and the sum of which, together with
all employer payroll Taxes associated therewith, the " _Total Closing Bonus
Payments_ ") and (b) payable on the date that is six (6) months following
the Closing Date (each, a " _Post-Closing Bonus_ " and the sum of which,
together with all employer payroll Taxes associated therewith, the "
_Estimated Total Post-Closing Bonus Payments_ "). At or prior to the Closing,
Sellers shall pay to each Qualified Employee the applicable Closing Bonus.
Promptly following the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall pay to each Qualified Employee who remains employed with
Purchaser and its Affiliates through such date the applicable Post-Closing
Bonus. Within ten (10) Business Days following the final Post-Closing Bonus
payment, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a statement setting forth the
total amount of Post-Closing Bonuses actually paid by Purchaser (the sum of
which, together with all employer payroll Taxes associated therewith, the "
_Final Total Post-Closing Bonus Payments_ "). If the amount of the Final Post-
Closing Bonus Payments is less than the amount of the Estimated Total Post-
Closing Bonus Payments, then Purchaser shall promptly pay to Sellers (in
immediately available funds to accounts designated by Sellers) an amount equal
to the Estimated Total Post-Closing Bonus Payments _minus _ the Final Total
Post-Closing Bonus Payments (the " _Post-Closing Bonus Adjustment_ ") and
Purchaser shall have no other obligation or liability associated with this
Section 8.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the employer payroll Taxes
actually paid by Purchaser exceed the amount set forth on Section 8.3 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (such amount, the " _Payroll Tax Shortfall_ "),
then Sellers shall, upon written notice by Purchaser setting forth such
amount, promptly pay to Purchaser (in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Purchaser) an amount equal to the Payroll Tax Shortfall.

 

SECTION 8.4. _Closing Compensation Payments_. Immediately prior to the
Closing, Sellers shall pay to each Employee all (a) accrued but unused
vacation time and other paid time off and (b) bonuses earned by employees
under written non-discretionary compensation plans.

 

SECTION 8.5. _Section 280G Shareholder Approval_. If requested by
Purchaser, Sellers shall (a) take all actions necessary to obtain a waiver
from each "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations thereunder) that shall provide that, if the requisite
shareholder approval under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
regulations thereunder is not obtained, no payments or benefits that would
separately or in the

 



-58-  aggregate constitute "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder) with respect to such
disqualified individual in the absence of such shareholder approval shall be
payable to or retained by such disqualified individual to the extent such
excess parachute payments would not be deductible by reason of the application
of Section 280G of the Code or would result in the imposition of excise Taxes
under Section 4999 of the Code upon such disqualified individual; and (b)
deliver to the shareholders of ICC or any other applicable entity a disclosure
statement in a form satisfactory to Purchaser, which satisfies the disclosure
obligations under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder, and which solicits and recommends that the shareholders vote in
favor of the transactions disclosed therein through a vote meeting
the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder. Sellers shall not make any such excess parachute payments that are
not so approved. Sellers shall provide Purchaser and its representatives with
a copy of the form of such waiver and such disclosure statement for its
approval no less than five (5) business days prior to delivery to each such
disqualified individual and shareholders of ICC and or any other applicable
entity, respectively. Within ten (10) days following the date of this
Agreement, with respect to each "disqualified individual" of ICC or any other
applicable entity and their respective Subsidiaries, Sellers shall provide to
Purchaser: (i) a schedule that sets forth (A) Sellers reasonable, good faith
estimate of all payments or benefits that could be provided to such
disqualified individual as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), and (B) the
"base amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such
individual, and (ii) the underlying data and documentation on which such
schedule is based.

 

SECTION 8.6. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the
generality of  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_, the provisions of this _Article_ __ _
VIII_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no
current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend or modify any Employee Plan/Agreement or any "employee
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Sellers,
Purchaser, or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the
ability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate
any employee benefit plan; or (iii) confer upon any individual any right to
employment or continued employment.

jurisdiction to a Person other than an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third-

SECTION 11.5. _No Waiver_. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not constitute a waiver by any Party of its rights
to indemnification hereunder, regardless of whether the Indemnified Party has
knowledge of the basis of the Claim at or prior to the Closing except to the
extent such knowledge was obtained through the express and unambiguous
disclosure contained in this Agreement or any Disclosure Schedule or Exhibit
attached hereto.

 

SECTION 11.6. _Set Off_. If any Seller or Shareholder fails to pay any
amounts that it, he, she or it is obligated to pay to Purchaser (or any other

available, on fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the Sellers and
Shareholders affected thereby, set off against any payments due to Sellers
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

 

SECTION 11.7. _Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures_. Each Indemnified
Party shall assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not result
from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") by giving the Indemnifying

describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, include copies of all
available material written evidence thereof and indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the failure to timely give such notice
shall only affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent
such failure actually and materially prejudices the defenses or other rights
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Direct Claim.

 

SECTION 11.8. _Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying
Party hereunder (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may reasonably be expected to

sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages
sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable, any other remedy sought
thereunder, a reasonably detailed explanation of the events giving rise to
such Third-Party Claim and any other material details pertaining thereto, in
each case to the extent known by the Indemnified Party (a " _Claim Notice_ ");
_provided_ that the failure to timely give a Claim Notice shall only affect
the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent such failure
actually and materially prejudices the defenses or other rights available to
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

 



-66- (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim within
thirty (30) days after the receipt of the applicable Claim Notice if the
Indemnifying Party admits that it has an indemnification obligation hereunder
with respect to the Third Party Claim, in which case such admission shall
constitute the Indemnifying Partys undertaking to pay directly all costs,
expenses, damages, judgments, awards, penalties and assessments incurred in
connection therewith, except as otherwise provided below; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that an Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume and
control the defense of any criminal or regulatory action or claim or any
Third-Party Claim in the event the Claim seeks equitable or non-monetary
remedies or obligations on the Indemnified Party, if a Third-Party Claim
involves a client of the Business or the business of any of the Sellers and or
their respective Affiliates, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation advisable, or if one or more defenses are available to
the Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party. With
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party may
undertake and control the defense, compromise and/or settlement of the Third-
Party Claim without admitting that it has an indemnification obligation
hereunder. In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party that it elects to defend, or is otherwise permitted by the Indemnified
Party to defend, the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings, with counsel not reasonably objected to by the
Indemnified Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party shall have so
assumed the defense of such action or claim, the Parties shall cooperate in
the defense of such action or claim, and all of the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense,
settlement or compromise of such claim or action shall be Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder to the extent provided herein. Once the Indemnifying
Party has made such election, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its
choosing at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise
or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim if the terms of such
settlement would result in (i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction,
decree or other binding action that would restrict the future activity or
conduct of such Indemnified Party or involve non-monetary relief, (ii) a
finding or admission of a violation of Law by such Indemnified Party, or (iii)
any monetary liability of such Indemnified Party that will not be paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without such Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). So
long as the Indemnifying Party is defending the Third-Party Claim actively
and in good faith pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.8_, the Indemnified
Party (A) shall not compromise or settle, or consent to the entry of a
judgment with respect to, the Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (B) shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation in the defense of the Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after notice
of the Third-Party Claim, fails to defend the Third-Party Claim actively and
in good faith as described in this _Section_ __ _ 11.8_, then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of 

 



-67-  the Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter have no right
to challenge the Indemnified Partys defense, compromise or settlement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 11.8_, if
there is a reasonable probability that any Third-Party Claim may materially
and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money
damages or other money payments, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to undertake and control the defense, compromise and/or settlement of
such Third Party Claim.

 

(c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party
Claim, including by providing reasonable access to each others relevant books
and records, and employees. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Party of books, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Third-Party Claim, and making employees and representatives available on a
mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 

(d) Anything to the contrary in this Section notwithstanding, if a Third-
Party Claim includes both a claim for Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities and
a claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Liabilities, the Parties shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to separate such Third-Party Claim
into two separate Tax Proceedings, one of which concerns only Taxes that are
Excluded Liabilities and the other of which concerns only Taxes that are not
Excluded Liabilities. If such Third-Party Claim cannot be so separated,
Sellers (if the claim for Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities exceeds or is
reasonably expected to exceed in amount the claim for Taxes that are not
Excluded Liabilities) or otherwise Purchaser (Sellers or Purchaser, as the
case may be, the " _Controlling Party_ "), shall be entitled to control such
Third-Party Claim (such Third-Party Claim, a " _Tax Claim_ "). In such case,
the other party (the " _Non-Controlling Party_") shall be entitled to
participate fully (at the Non-Controlling Partys sole expense) in the conduct
of such Tax Claim and the Controlling Party shall not settle such Tax Claim
without the consent of such Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The costs and expenses of
conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be reasonably apportioned based
on the relative amounts at issue in the Tax Claim that are Excluded
Liabilities that are not Excluded Liabilities.

 

SECTION 11.9. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. For all Tax
purposes, Purchaser, Sellers and each of their respective Affiliates agree to
treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price received by Sellers for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



-68- ARTICLE XII

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

SECTION 12.1. _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Purchaser or Sellers
(including by operation of Law in connection with a merger, consolidation or
sale of substantially all the assets of Purchaser or any Seller) without the
prior written consent of the other Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser may assign any or all rights under this Agreement to purchase any of
the Acquired Assets or assume any of the Assumed Liabilities to any of its
Affiliates upon prior written notice to Sellers;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no such assignment shall release Purchaser from any liability under this
Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 12.1_
shall be void.

 

SECTION 12.2. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in
_Article_ __ _ XI_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties
and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to
any Person, other than the Parties, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

 

SECTION 12.3. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party incurring
such costs and expenses. All filing fees required in connection with the HSR
Act shall be borne solely one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Sellers.

 

SECTION 12.4. _Amendments_ _and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.
By an instrument in writing Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the
other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision of
this Agreement that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or
perform. No single waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed to or shall constitute, absent an express statement otherwise, a
continuous waiver of such provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof
(whether or not similar). No delay on the part of any Party in exercising any
right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.

 

SECTION 12.5. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by
hand or sent by facsimile or e-mail with receipt confirmed or sent, postage
prepaid, by registered, certified or express mail or reputable overnight
courier service and shall be deemed given when so delivered by hand or sent
by facsimile or email with receipt confirmed, or if mailed, three days after
mailing (one (1) Business Day in the case of overnight mail or overnight
courier service), as follows:

SECTION 12.6. _Interpretation; Exhibits, Seller Disclosure Schedule and
Other Schedules_. The definitions of the terms herein shall apply equally to
the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may
require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and
neuter forms. The words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed
to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall." Unless
the context requires otherwise, (i) any definition of or reference to any
agreement, instrument or other document herein shall be construed as referring
to such agreement, instrument or other document as from time to time amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified (subject to any restrictions on such
amendments, supplements or modifications set forth therein), (ii) the words
"herein",

 



-70-  "hereof" and "hereunder", and words of similar import, shall be construed to
refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision
hereof, (iii) all references herein to Articles, Sections, Appendices,
Exhibits or Schedules shall be construed to refer to Articles, Sections,
Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement, (iv) the word "or" shall
be inclusive and not exclusive (for example, the phrase "A or B" means "A or
B or both," not "either A or B but not both"), unless used in conjunction with
"either" or the like; and (v) the headings contained in this Agreement, the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, other Schedules or any Appendix or Exhibit and in
the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Any matter that is disclosed in a particular section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to have been included in the other sections of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and/or to qualify other representations and
warranties set forth herein, notwithstanding the omission of a cross-
reference thereto or the omission of a reference to any section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule within the Agreement, so long as the relevance of such
matter to such other sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
representations and warranties is reasonably apparent on its face. Disclosure
of any fact or item in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not
necessarily mean that such fact or item is material to Sellers individually
or taken as a whole. The Seller Disclosure Schedule, all other Schedules and
all Appendices and Exhibits annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. All statements and information contained in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed representations and warranties by the Sellers under
_Article_ __ _ IV_. Any capitalized terms used in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, any other Schedule or any Appendix or Exhibit annexed hereto but
not otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by
the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 12.7. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have
been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party.

 

SECTION 12.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Seller
Disclosure Schedule), the Other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement contain the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings relating to such subject matter. There have been and are
no representations, warranties or covenants among the Parties other than those
set forth or provided for in this Agreement.

 

SECTION 12.9. _Severability_. If any court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, are illegal or excessively broad as to
duration, geographical scope or activity, then such provisions shall be
construed so that the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be
affected, but shall remain in full force and effect, and any such illegal or
overly broad provisions shall be deemed, without further action on the part of
any Person, to be modified, amended and/or limited, but only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid and enforceable in the applicable
jurisdiction.

 



-71- SECTION 12.10. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in Dallas,
Texas (" _Texas Courts_ ") for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Other Transaction Documents
or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Party agrees to
commence any such action, suit or proceeding only in the Texas Courts. Each
Party further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document
by U.S. registered mail to such Partys respective address set forth above
shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding in
the Texas Courts with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to
jurisdiction in this  _Section_ __ _ 12.10_. Each Party irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in the Texas
Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

SECTION 12.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Other Transaction
Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Party (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other Parties have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this  _Section_ __ _
12.11_.

SECTION 12.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state,
without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state.

 

SECTION 12.13. _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that the other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each Party
agrees that, without posting a bond or other undertaking and in addition to
any other remedy to which a Party may be entitled at law or equity, the other
Party will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in
any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over
the Parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may
be entitled, at law or in equity. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Sellers and Shareholders specifically agree that any breach of the
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing
Date or any breach by any Sellers or Shareholders of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ will result in irreparable injury to Purchaser for which
a remedy at law would be inadequate. Each Party further agrees that, in the
event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach or
violation, it will not assert as a defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate.

 



-72- SECTION 12.14. _Obligation of Shareholders_. Shareholders, jointly and
severally, hereby unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees,
undertakes and promises to cause Sellers, AFIC and AFIC II to fully and
promptly pay, perform and observe all of Sellers, AFICs and AFIC
IIs obligations under, with respect to, in connection with or otherwise
arising out of or relating to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Sellers 
Obligations_"), whether according to the present terms hereof or thereof, or
pursuant to any change in the terms, covenants or conditions hereof or
thereof at any time hereafter validly made or granted. In the event that any
Seller or AFIC II fails in any manner whatsoever to pay, perform or observe
any of Sellers Obligations, Shareholders, jointly and severally, agree to
duly and promptly pay, perform or observe, as the case may be, the Sellers
Obligations, or cause the same to be duly and promptly paid, performed or
observed, in each case as if such Shareholder were itself Sellers, AFIC or
AFIC II with respect to the Sellers Obligations.

 

SECTION 12.15. _Obligation of Purchaser Parent_. Purchaser Parent hereby
unconditionally, absolutely and irrevocably guarantees, undertakes and
promises to cause Purchaser to fully and promptly pay, perform and observe all
of Purchasers obligations under, with respect to, in connection with or
otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Obligations_ "), whether according to the present terms hereof or
thereof, or pursuant to any change in the terms, covenants or conditions
hereof or thereof at any time hereafter validly made or granted. In the event
that Purchaser fails in any manner whatsoever to pay, perform or observe any
of the Purchaser Obligations, Purchaser Parent will duly and promptly pay,
perform or observe, as the case may be, the Purchaser Obligations, or
cause the same to be duly and promptly paid, performed or observed, in each
case as if Purchaser Parent were itself Purchaser with respect to the
Purchaser Obligations.
