Merger Sub or Buyer (including the Class A Units that shall be indirectly
acquired by Buyer as a result of the consummation of the BC Merger
Transaction), shall not convert as described in Sections 2.02(a) and 2.02(b)
above but shall instead by virtue  ---------------- ------- of the Merger

retired and shall cease to exist with no payment being made hereunder with
respect thereto.   2.03 Cancellation of Options. In accordance with the
terms of the  ----------------------- Company\'s 2002 Security Option Plan,

the Final Unit Price minus the  ----- exercise price corresponding to such
Option; provided, however, that the  -------- ------- amount paid at the

such Option shall be an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Closing Unit
Price minus the exercise price corresponding to such Option. Following 
----- the Effective Time, the Final Unit Price (to the extent not paid
pursuant to the preceding sentence) minus the exercise price corresponding to

Purchase Price") equal to $223.5  --------------------  million (the "Base
Consideration"), plus (A) the total amount of Cash  ------------------ ---- 
on Hand, minus (B) the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the  ----- 
Closing, plus (C) the aggregate exercise price of the Options, plus  ----
----  (D) the Aggregate Net Return Threshold, minus (E) the German Funding 
-----  Amount, minus (F) the UK Funding Amount, minus (G) the Transaction 
----- -----  Expenses, minus (H) the Escrow Amount, plus (I) the aggregate 
----- ----  distributions, if any, to the Sellers pursuant to the Escrow 
Agreement, by   (ii) the Aggregate Unit Number; and   (y) the Estimated
Closing Unit Price.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Closing Unit
Price" shall  ------------------ mean the quotient determined by
dividing:    - 3 -    (i) an amount (the "Closing Purchase Price") equal
to the  ----------------------  Base Consideration, plus (A) the total
amount of Cash on Hand, minus  ---- -----  (B) the outstanding amount of
Indebtedness as of the Closing, plus  ----  (C) the aggregate exercise price
of the Options, plus (D) the  ----  Aggregate Net Return Threshold, minus
(E) the German Funding  -----  Amount, minus (F) the UK Funding Amount,
minus (G) the Transaction  ----- -----  Expenses, minus (H) the Escrow
Amount, by  -----   (ii) the Aggregate Unit Number.   2.05 Delivery of
Estimated Closing Unit Price Calculation. At least 
---------------------------------------------------- seven days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer its good faith calculation
of the Closing Unit Price as of the Closing Date (to be updated on a daily
basis by the Company until Closing), including the components thereof. During
such period, Buyer shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to discuss such
calculation with the members of the Company\'s management and (if necessary)
Buyer and the Company shall together in good faith review the calculation of
the Closing Unit Price (and the basis upon which it was calculated) and make
any modifications that are necessary to make such calculation accurate. The
"Estimated Closing Unit Price" shall be  ---------------------------- based
on such calculation, as determined under this Section 2.05, undertaken 
------------ two business days prior to the Closing Date.   2.06 The
Closing.  -----------   (a) Immediately following the consummation of the
transaction referenced in clause (b) below, the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of  ------- Kirkland and Ellis LLP located at 200 East Randolph Drive,
Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 a.m. on August 31, 2004, or, if any of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article III (other than those to be
satisfied at the  ----------- Closing) have not been satisfied or waived by
the party entitled to the benefit thereof, then on or prior to the third
business day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in Article III other than those to be satisfied at the
Closing or on such other ----------- date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer
and the Company. The date and time of the Closing are referred to herein as
the "Closing Date."  ------------   (b) Immediately prior to the Closing,
Buyer and the other parties thereto shall consummate the BC Merger
Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed and understood that the
aggregate purchase price paid by Buyer under the BC Merger Agreement shall,
as further described in the BC Merger Agreement, be equal to the result
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Class A Units owned by BC by (ii)
the Final Unit Price; provided, however, that the amount paid at the closing
of the BC  -------- ------- Merger Transaction shall be determined by
substituting the Estimated Closing Unit Price for the Final Unit Price.
Following the Effective Time, the Final Unit Price (to the extent not paid
pursuant to the preceding sentence) shall be paid in respect of each such
Class A Unit previously owned by BC in accordance with the terms of the BC
Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.   (c) Simultaneously with the
Closing, Buyer shall deposit, for the benefit of the Sellers, the Escrow
Amount into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") established pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the  -------------- Escrow Agreement. Wells
Fargo Bank, National     - 4 -   Association shall serve as the escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent") under the  ------------ Escrow Agreement. Other
than a final distribution, if any, owed to the Sellers in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Amount will be available solely to
satisfy amounts owed to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.08 and Section 9.01(a),
to satisfy amounts owed to the ------------ --------------- Representative
as contemplated herein, to satisfy amounts owed to the Independent Auditor as
contemplated herein and to satisfy amounts owed to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.   (d) Simultaneously with
the Closing, Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, the Closing Indebtedness by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as directed by the holders of Closing
Indebtedness and cause all Liens securing or supporting the Closing
Indebtedness to be released and terminated.   (e) Simultaneously with the
Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, the German Funding Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as directed by the Company for purposes of funding
outstanding pension liabilities under the German Plans.   (f)
Simultaneously with the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on
behalf of the Sellers and the Company (as applicable), the Transaction
Expenses by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed by the
Company.   2.07 Exchange Procedures.  -------------------   (a) Paying
Agent. The Company (and, after the Effective Time,  ------------ the
Surviving Company) shall act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") in 
------------ effecting the payment of the Closing Date Merger Consideration
to the holders of Class A Units, Class P Units and Options entitled thereto
in accordance with this Article II. Simultaneous with the Closing, each
holder  ---------- who has delivered its respective Securityholder Documents
shall be paid at the Effective Time the consideration to which he, she or it
is entitled under Section 2.02 and Section 2.03 above. Payment to each holder
of such  ------------ ------------ amount shall be made by wire transfer of
funds to an account designated in writing by such holder to the Paying
Agent.   (b) Payment of Closing Date Merger Consideration; Delivery of 
--------------------------------------------------------- Securityholder
Documents at the Closing. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay
to --------------------------------------- the Paying Agent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Paying Agent no later than two days prior to the Closing Date, an amount
equal to the Closing Date Merger Consideration (it being understood that
Buyer shall have separately paid the purchase price to the stockholders of BC
pursuant to the BC Merger Agreement). At the Effective Time (or after the
Effective Time in the case of a holder of record not delivering the
appropriate Securityholder Documents until after the Effective Time), the
Paying Agent shall deliver to each holder of record, as of the Effective
Time, of outstanding Class A Units, Class P Units and Options, upon each
holder\'s delivery of the respective Securityholder Documents, the
consideration payable to such holder as set forth in Section 2.02 or Section
2.03 above by wire transfer of immediately  ------------
------------ available funds to an account designated by such holder to the
Paying Agent prior to the Closing. The documents to be delivered by holders
of Class A Units, Class P Units or Options (referred to herein as the
"Securityholder  -------------- Documents") shall be (A) in the case of the
Class A Units and ---------    - 5 -  Class P Units, a duly executed
letter of transmittal substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
(the "Letter of Transmittal") and (B) in the case  ---------
--------------------- of the Options, a duly executed Option Cancellation
Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Option
Cancellation Agreement").  --------- -----------------------------   (c)
Delivery of Securityholder Documents After the Closing. 
------------------------------------------------------ With respect to each
Class A Unit or Class P Unit for which the respective Securityholder
Documents were not so delivered at or prior to the Closing, the Paying Agent
shall promptly thereafter mail to the holder thereof instructions for
delivering such Securityholder Documents in exchange for the payment to such
holder of the consideration to which he, she or it is entitled under Section
2.02 above. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of such 
------------ Securityholder Documents, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the
holder of the Class A Units or Class P Units, as the case may be, in exchange
therefor the amounts set forth in Section 2.02 above.  ------------   (d)
No Interest Accrual; Conditions to Payment. No interest 
------------------------------------------ will be paid or accrued on the
amounts payable upon the delivery of the Securityholder Documents. If payment
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Class A Unit,
Class P Unit or an Option is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or similar
taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the holder of
record or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until the respective Securityholder
Documents are delivered with respect to Class A Units or Class P Units, such
Class A Units or Class P Units shall represent for all purposes only the
right to receive payment of the amounts specified in Section 2.02 above in
respect of such Class A  ------------ Units or Class P Units, as the case
may be.   (e) Unclaimed Funds. Any portion of the funds deposited with 
--------------- the Paying Agent which remains undistributed to the holders
of Class A Units or Class P Units for one year after the Effective Time shall
become available to the Surviving Company for all purposes, and any holder of
Class A Units or Class P Units who has not theretofore complied with
this Section 2.07 shall thereafter look only as a general claimant to the
Surviving ------------ Company for payment of the sums to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Agreement.   (f) No Liability. Neither Buyer
nor the Surviving Company  ------------ shall be liable to any holder of
Class A Units or Class P Units for any cash delivered by the Paying Agent or
the Surviving Company in good faith to a public official pursuant to an
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (g) No Further
Ownership Rights in Class A Units or Class P 
------------------------------------------------------- Units; Transfer
Books. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further --------------------- registration of transfers on the unit transfer
books of the Surviving Company of Class A Units and Class P Units that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
the unit ledger of the Company shall be closed.   (h) Withholding Rights.
Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving  ------------------ Company shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Class A
Units, Class P Units or Options pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with    - 6 -  respect to the
making of such payment under any provision of Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such holder of Class A Units, Class P Units or Options in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Company.   2.08 Closing Unit Price Reconciliation. 
---------------------------------   (a) As promptly as possible, but in any
event within 45 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the

Statements"). After delivery of the Closing Statements, the

Buyer, then Buyer shall withdraw  ------------------ an amount from the
Escrow Account equal to the Settlement Payment, or (ii) the Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers), then Buyer shall pay to the Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) the Settlement Payment. All payments determined to be
due under this Section 2.08(b) to Buyer or the 
--------------- Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall be made
promptly after such determination, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds (whether out of the Escrow Account or otherwise) and in accordance with
procedures (if any)    - 7 -  agreed between Buyer and the Representative

necessary). The release to the Sellers of any portion of the Escrow Amount
not otherwise due to Buyer under the terms of this Section 2.08(b) shall be

respect to any amount paid to the Representative under this Section 2.08, the

Cunningham, E. Michael Wenzel or Daniel P. Levy); provided, that except to

parties hereto including any rights to terminate or to seek
indemnification.    - 30 -   6.05 Unitholder Approval. The Company shall

portions thereof.   7.02 Director and Officer Liability and
Indemnification.  --------------------------------------------------   (a)
For a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not
permit BC or the Surviving Company or any of the Subsidiaries to, amend,

the Subsidiaries\' certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) relating to the exculpation or indemnification of
any managers (in the context of a limited liability company), directors or
officers (unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties that
the managers (in the context of a limited liability company), directors or
officers of BC and the Company and the Subsidiaries shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the
Law.   (b) If there is no existing tail or runoff coverage for

to, maintain director and officer liability insurance (the "New Policy") to 
---------- provide coverage for the individuals who were managers (in the

Company or the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing comparable to the policy or
policies maintained by BC or the Company or the Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such individuals in
the form disclosed by the Company to Buyer prior to the date of this
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company may elect to provide, in
addition to the New Policy, further coverage for such director and officer
liability insurance (the "Top-Up Policy"); provided, that, should the Company
make  ------------- -------- ---- such election, the amount necessary to
purchase the Top-Up Policy shall be set forth on the attached    - 31

a ----------------------------- "Transaction Expense" for all purposes under

the  ----------- taxable year of the Company shall end as of the Closing
Date and, with respect to all other income taxes, the parties shall, unless

prior to  ------------- filing each such Tax Return, Buyer shall deliver a
copy of such Tax Return to the Representative (or its designee(s)), together

Deposit Funds are payable, as the case may be, is at least the amount of the
Termination Fee or Deposit Funds, as the case may be, and the parties further

payment of such Termination Fee is not Buyer\'s exclusive remedy for such
matters, but the payment of such Termination Fee shall be taken into account

compensation or other remedy. The amount payable under this Section 8.03 is
not intended or likely to be, nor shall  ------------ it be deemed to be, a
penalty against the Paying Party.   - 34 -   ARTICLE IX

Agreement to the contrary, the Excluded Matters shall not be subject to any
limitations whatsoever as against Persons responsible for such Excluded
Matters. Other than for the Excluded Matters to the extent set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Buyer Indemnitees may not avoid such
limitation on liability by seeking damages for breach of Contract, tort or

implication    - 36 -  herein to the contrary, any indemnification of the
Buyer Indemnitees shall be satisfied solely and exclusively by setoff against
the funds remaining in the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms hereof and
the Escrow Agreement, including the payment of fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the defense of a Third Party Claim as set forth in Section

way of set off against the funds remaining in the Escrow Account pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement or seek recovery against the applicable
party to the Closing Agreement, but in no event shall Buyer recover twice for
the same loss. Other than with respect to the Excluded Matters, no claim
shall be brought or maintained by the Buyer, the Subsidiaries (including
after the Effective Time, BC and the Surviving Company and the Subsidiaries)
or its or their respective Affiliates, successors or permitted assigns or any
other Buyer Indemnitee against any of the Seller Indemnitees, and no recourse
shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon
any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company or any other Person
set forth or contained in this Agreement, of BC or any other Person set forth
in the BC Merger Agreement, or any of the agreements, documents and
instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith and therewith, the
subject matter of this Agreement or the BC Merger Agreement, any
information, document or material furnished or made available to Buyer in
certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in
anticipation of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the BC Merger Agreement, the ownership, operation, management,
use, control of, and other actions or omissions with respect to, the business
of BC or the Company and the Subsidiaries, any of their assets, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any other actions or omissions at or
prior to the Closing Date or the Effective Time. Buyer, the Subsidiaries
(including after the Effective Time, BC and the Surviving Company and the
Subsidiaries), and its and their respective Affiliates, successors and
permitted assigns and any other Buyer Indemnitee hereby irrevocably waive all
such claims of any type or description and hereby agree to indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Seller Indemnitees from and against and in respect of
any and all Damages and other losses incurred by any Seller Indemnitee as a
result of any such claim brought or maintained by any such party against any
Seller Indemnitee in contravention of this Section 9.01(c). OTHER THAN WITH
RESPECT  --------------- TO THE EXCLUDED MATTERS (AND SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO
THE PERSONS DIRECTLY RELATED THERETO), EACH RELEASING PARTY EXPRESSLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHTS AFFORDED BY ANY STATUTE WHICH LIMITS THE EFFECT OF A RELEASE WITH
RESPECT TO UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH RELEASING PARTY UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THIS RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROTECTION AGAINST
A RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS. EACH RELEASING PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT THIS WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL AND MATERIAL TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary, this Section 9.01(c) shall
not have the  --------------- effect of limiting any surviving obligations
pursuant to the terms of (i) the Contribution Agreement, dated as of March
15, 2002, by and among The Nash Engineering Company, a Connecticut
corporation ("TNEC"), Nash  ---- Industries, L.L.C. (n/k/a nash_elmo
Industries, L.L.C.) and Mondo Acquisition LLC (n/k/a the Company), as amended

Buyer Indemnitee and Seller Indemnitee shall take all reasonable steps to
mitigate any Damages for which such Person may be entitled to indemnification
hereunder. If the amount to be netted (in accordance with clause (ii) of the
definition of Damages) from any payment required under this Article IX is
determined after payment by the  ---------- Indemnifying Party of an amount
otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article IX,
the Indemnitee shall repay to the  ---------- Indemnifying Party, promptly
after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not
have had to pay pursuant to this Article IX had  ---------- such
determination been made at the time of such payment.   (e) With respect to
any particular matter, no party shall be entitled to any indemnification
under this Article IX to the extent that  ---------- specific allowance,
provision or reserve has been made for such matter in the Latest Balance
Sheet or to the extent that such matter has been otherwise specifically
addressed pursuant to an adjustment under Section 2.08. ------------  
9.02 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants; 
------------------------------------------------------ Knowledge of
Breach. -------------------   (a) All representations and warranties of,
and covenants and agreements made or performed or to be performed on or prior
to Closing of, any Person contained herein and the BC Merger Agreement and
all claims of any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee in respect of any
breach of any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or the BC Merger Agreement, shall survive the Closing and
shall expire on the date that is eighteen months after the Closing Date.
The covenants in this Agreement and the BC Merger Agreement that are to
be performed after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms.   (b) No party hereto shall be deemed to have
breached any representation, warranty or covenant prior to Closing contained
herein if such party shall have notified the other party hereto, on or prior
to the Closing Date (including pursuant to Section 6.04), of the breach of,
or  ------------ inaccuracy in, or of any facts or circumstances
constituting or resulting in the breach of or inaccuracy in, such
representation, warranty or covenant and the Closing occurs.   9.03 Claims
for Indemnification. If any Indemnitee shall 
-------------------------- believe that such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX in respect of any Damages, such
Indemnitee shall promptly give ---------- the appropriate Indemnifying Party
notice of such claim (a "Notice of  --------- Claim") before the expiration
of the time period specified in Section 9.02. ----- ------------ Any such
Notice of Claim shall set forth in reasonable detail and to the extent then
known the basis for such claim for indemnification and the amount of the
claim, to the extent specified or otherwise known. As long as the Notice of
Claim is delivered within the time period specified in Section 9.02, the
failure of such Indemnitee to give the Notice of Claim
for ------------ indemnification promptly shall not adversely affect such
Indemnitee\'s right to indemnity hereunder, except to the extent that the
defense of any claim is prejudiced by such failure.   9.04 Defense of
Claims. In connection with any claim that may  ----------------- give rise
to indemnity under this Article IX resulting from or arising out 
---------- of any action, suit, proceeding or arbitration    - 38
-  against an Indemnitee by a Person that is not a party hereto (a "Third
Party  ----------- Claim"), the Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled to
participate in the ----- defense thereof and, if they so notify the
Indemnitees within 30 days (or as soon as practicable, if the nature of the
claim so requires), to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the Indemnifying Parties. Such Indemnifying Parties may assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim subject to a reservation of rights as to the
determination of whether such Third Party Claim is subject to indemnification
hereunder, and such Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to a prompt
reimbursement from the Indemnitee (solely to the extent of the Escrow Account
in the case of an Indemnitee that is a Seller Indemnitee) to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is found not responsible for indemnification under this
Article IX. Should the  ---------- Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
the Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee
in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the Indemnitees shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof provided, that, the
Indemnifying Party shall compensate the Indemnitees for all their out of
pocket expenses related thereto and that any such action by the Indemnitees
shall be during regular business hours, under reasonable circumstances and
shall not unreasonably disrupt the business of the Indemnitees. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party\'s
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee
shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party\'s prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or entry
into any settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitees (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless
the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money
damages and includes an absolute and unconditional release of the Indemnitees
from any liability in connection with the Third Party Claim and would not in
the reasonable opinion of the Indemnitees adversely affect the Indemnitees\'
ongoing business operations. If the Indemnifying Party fails to defend or if,
after commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Party
fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the Indemnifying
Party\'s expense.   9.05 Nature of Payments. Any indemnity payments made
under of this  ------------------ Article IX shall be treated for tax
purposes as an adjustment of the Final ---------- Purchase Price paid under
this Agreement to the extent such characterization is proper and permissible
under relevant Tax authorities.    - 39 -   ARTICLE X  
REPRESENTATIVE  --------------   10.01 Designation. The parties have agreed
that it is desirable to  ----------- designate a representative to act on

appoints  --------- the Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-

of assignment as Buyer or Merger Sub shall reasonably request; (v) to
negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle any of the matters under

incurred by the Representative in connection therewith; (vi) to pursue any
rights to indemnification hereunder of such Seller and to negotiate, settle,
compromise and otherwise handle any claim for indemnification by any Buyer
Indemnitee hereunder and to determine the amount of any expenses incurred by
the Representative in connection therewith; (vii) to take all other actions
to be taken by or on behalf of such Seller in connection herewith; including
under the Escrow Agreement and (viii) to do each and every act and exercise
any and all rights which such Seller or the Sellers collectively are
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement). Each Seller
agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore
irrevocable without the consent of the Representative and shall survive the
death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. All
decisions and actions by the Representative (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.
The Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts, consultants and other advisors as it shall deem necessary in

Seller, pursuant to Section  ------- 10.02 above (an "Authorized Action"),
and that each Authorized Action shall ----- ----------------- be binding on
each Seller as fully as if such Seller had taken such Authorized Action.
Buyer and Merger Sub agree that the Representative shall have no liability to
Buyer and Merger Sub for any Authorized Action, except to the extent that
such Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful misconduct.   - 40
-    10.04 Exculpation. The Representative shall not have by reason of 
----------- this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller,
except in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Seller. The
Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or
omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other
document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Representative
shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by Law for willful misconduct.
The Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers for any apportionment
or distribution of payments made by the Representative in good faith, and if
any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have
been made in error the sole recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due,
but not made, shall be to recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of
the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled.
The Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning
either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or
conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Representative nor any agent
employed by it shall incur any liability to any Seller by virtue of the
failure or refusal of the Representative for any reason to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other
duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or bad
faith.   ARTICLE XI   ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS
