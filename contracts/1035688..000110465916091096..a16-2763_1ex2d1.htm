 ** _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_**

 



 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " **Agreement** ") is made and entered
into as of January 22, 2016 by and among Select Medical Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" **Buyer** "), Grip Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" **Merger Sub** "), Physiotherapy Associates Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " **Company** "), and the Holder Representative (as
defined herein), solely in its capacity as such. Each of Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company and the Holder Representative are sometimes referred to herein as
a " **Party** " and collectively as the " **Parties**."

 



 

 ** _RECITALS_**

 



 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of the Company and Buyer believe it
is in the best interests of each company and their respective stockholders
that Buyer acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company and, in furtherance thereof, have approved such merger;
and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements in connection with such merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, premises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows.

 



 

 **ARTICLE I _ 
DEFINITIONS_**

 



 

The meanings of capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall be as set forth
in _Appendix A_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II _ 
THE MERGER_**

 



 

2.1 **_Merger_**. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " **Merger**
"), pursuant to which (a) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and (b) the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under
its present name (the " **Surviving Corporation** ") as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Buyer.

 



 

2.2 **_Effective Time_**. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by properly executing and filing a Certificate of
Merger substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
**Certificate of Merger** ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. When used
in this

      
 

 



 

Agreement, the term " **Effective Time** " shall mean the date and time at
which the Certificate of Merger is accepted for filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or as otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Merger.

 



 

2.3 **_Effect of the Merger_**. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, (a) the separate corporate existence of the Company with all
its rights, privileges, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the
Merger, (b) all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, (c) without any further
action on the part of the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub, the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended, (d) the
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended, (e)
the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time, each to hold the office of director of the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws of the State of Delaware
and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors are duly qualified and elected and (f) the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold
office in accordance with the provisions of the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

2.4 **_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Company_**.

 



 

2.4.1. **_Treasury Shares_**. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parties or the holders of Capital
Stock, all shares of capital stock of the Company that are held in the
treasury of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be automatically
cancelled and retired, and cease to exist, without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid or payable in exchange therefor.

 



 

2.4.2. **_Capital Stock_**. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties or the holders of Capital Stock,
each then issued and outstanding share of Capital Stock (a) shall be cancelled
and retired and will cease to exist and (b) excluding any Dissenting Shares
and any shares held in the treasury of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
which treasury shares shall be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.4.1_,
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the applicable
portion of the Final Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to _Section
2.6_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly
representing such share together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal,
all in accordance with, and pursuant to, the Company Charter.

 



 

2.4.3. **_Company Options_**. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary (including, without limitation, obtaining any
required consents and providing any required notices) to (i) cause all
outstanding Company Options to become fully vested and exercisable, (ii)
cancel and terminate each outstanding Company Option as of the Effective Time
in exchange for the right of the holder of such Company Option to receive the
applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to
_Section 2.6_, without interest thereon and (iii) terminate the CompanyÂ’s
2014 Stock Incentive Plan. As of

 



      
 

 



 

immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not have
any obligations, and no current or former holder of Company Options shall have
any rights, arising under or in connection with the Company Options or the
CompanyÂ’s 2014 Stock Incentive Plan except as expressly provided herein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to the
contrary, no portion of the Final Merger Consideration will be paid with
respect to any Company Option following the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing Date.

 



 

2.4.4. **_Dissenting Shares_**. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Capital Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a holder of Capital
Stock who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such
shares in accordance with the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights (" **Dissenting Shares**
"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive a portion of
the Final Merger Consideration hereunder, but the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 2.4.4_, if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
effectively withdraw, waive or lose (through failure to perfect, court order
or otherwise) such appraisal rights, then, as of the later of the Effective
Time and the occurrence of such event, such holderÂ’s Dissenting Shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled hereunder. The Company shall provide Buyer prompt
notice of any demand for appraisal received by the Company, and Buyer shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

2.4.5. **_Holders of Certificates_**. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Certificates or
the shares of Capital Stock represented thereby, except the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Final Merger Consideration as determined
pursuant to _Section 2.6_, without interest thereon.

 



 

2.5 **_Effect on Capital Stock of Merger Sub_**. At the Effective Time, the
shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and exchanged on a
one-for-one basis for shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, all in
accordance with, and pursuant to, the terms of this Agreement and Merger SubÂ’s
certificate of incorporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall continue to evidence
ownership of common stock of the Surviving Corporation consistent with the
foregoing.

 



 

2.6 **_Final Merger Consideration and Payment_**.

 



 

2.6.1. **_Final Merger Consideration and Allocation_**. The " **Unadjusted
Merger Consideration** " shall consist of an amount in cash equal to
$400,000,000.00 (Four Hundred Million Dollars). The Unadjusted Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted at Closing by (i) adding the Excess Payment,
if any, calculated pursuant to _Section 2.8.1_, (ii) subtracting the
Shortfall Reduction, if any, calculated pursuant to _Section 2.8.1_, (iii)
subtracting Estimated Company Transaction Expenses and (iv) subtracting
Estimated Indebtedness, if any (as adjusted,

 



      
 

 



 

the " **Initial Merger Consideration** "). The Initial Merger Consideration
shall be further adjusted following the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.8.2_.
Subject to the requirements of _Section 2.6.2_, the Final Merger
Consideration shall be allocated and paid among the Sellers such that each
Seller shall receive its Pro Rata Portion of the Initial Distribution and any
other payments hereunder constituting a portion of the Final Merger
Consideration.

 



 

2.6.2. **_Payment and Surrender_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall distribute (i) to each holder of
Capital Stock a letter of transmittal in the form attached as _Exhibit B_
hereto, which shall include a customary release of Buyer, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company Subsidiaries and the Buyer Related Parties
and an agreement to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (including the
indemnification obligations set forth in _Article VIII_) (a " **Letter of
Transmittal** "), for use in surrendering the stock certificates evidencing
the shares of Capital Stock (each, a " **Certificate** ") and (ii) to each
holder of Company Options a stock option cancellation agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (an " **Option Cancellation Agreement** ")
terminating and cancelling all Company Options held by such holder in exchange
for the payments, if any, owed in respect thereof described in this _Section
2.6_ (together with the Letter of Transmittal, a " **Transmittal Document** ")
in exchange for the payments, if any, provided for in this Agreement. Each
Seller that has properly completed, executed and delivered (x) to U.S. Bank
National Association or another paying agent mutually acceptable to Buyer and
the Company (the " **Payment Agent** ") the Letter of Transmittal, an IRS Form
W-8 or W-9, as appropriate, and the Certificate(s) evidencing such SellerÂ’s
shares of Capital Stock, if any (or in lieu thereof an affidavit of loss and
indemnity agreement pursuant to _Section 2.6.2(h)_) or (y) to the Company or
the Surviving Corporation the Option Cancellation Agreement and an IRS Form
W-8 or W-9, as appropriate, shall in each case be entitled to receive the
consideration specified in _Section 2.6.1_ with respect thereto and in
accordance with the terms hereof. If payment or delivery is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name a Certificate so surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer, that the signatures on the Certificate or any related stock power
shall be properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment
either pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(b) The " **Initial Distribution** " shall be equal to (i) the Initial Merger
Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the sum of (A) the Indemnity Escrow Amount, (B)
the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (C) the Holder Expense Fund. At the Effective
Time, Buyer shall pay (x) to the Payment Agent for payment to the Sellers the
portion of the Initial Distribution payable in respect of Capital Stock and
(y) to the Surviving Corporation for payment to the Sellers, in accordance
with this _Section 2.6.2_, the portion of the Initial Distribution payable in
respect of Company Options.

 



 

(c) Pending delivery by the applicable Seller of the items required pursuant
to _Section 2.6.2(a)_, each Certificate (other than certificates representing
treasury shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.4.1_ and Dissenting Shares)
and each Company Option shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive in accordance

 



      
 

 



 

with this Agreement the portion of the Final Merger Consideration that is due
to such Seller hereunder.

 



 

(d) All payments to a Seller hereunder shall be made pursuant to the
instructions provided in such SellerÂ’s Transmittal Document; _provided_ , that
if such payment is taxable as compensation, such payment shall be made to the
Surviving Corporation on behalf of such Seller and, subject to _Section
2.6.2(e)_, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly pay such
payment to such Seller.

 



 

(e) Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or the Payment Agent and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person who otherwise would have received the payment in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent.

 



 

(f) Payments of fair value in respect of Dissenting Shares, if any, pursuant
to the DGCL shall be made, first, from that portion of the Final Merger
Consideration allocable to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 2.6.1_
and, second, by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation directly. After any such
payments have been made, any rights associated with such Dissenting Shares
shall be cancelled.

 



 

(g) No interest will be paid or will accrue for the benefit of the Sellers on
the consideration payable upon delivery of a Transmittal Document and, if
applicable, the surrender of the Certificates.

 



 

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and an indemnity
agreement by the registered holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Buyer (if such affidavit is accepted before the Effective Time) or the Holder
Representative and Buyer (if such affidavit is accepted after the Effective
Time), the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable
consideration payable in respect thereof in the manner, and subject to the
other terms, set forth in _Section 2.6.1_ and this _Section 2.6.2_.

 



 

(i) If Certificates are not surrendered prior to the date that all amounts
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account have been distributed, all
consideration payable with respect thereto shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be deposited by the Payment Agent with the Surviving
Corporation and may be commingled with the general funds of the Surviving
Corporation. Thereafter, any Seller surrendering its Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation all consideration payable under the terms of this Agreement with
respect to the Capital Stock represented by such Certificates; _provided_ that
neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any

 



      
 

 



 

Person in respect of any cash or other property delivered to a Governmental
Entity as required pursuant to any applicable property, escheat or similar
Law. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation may terminate the Payment Agent
Agreement at any time on or after the date that all amounts remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and, to the extent paid to the Payment Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.9_, the Holder Expense Fund have been distributed
by the Payment Agent (as applicable, in accordance with _Section 2.6.2(k)_).

 



 

(j) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Capital
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares) are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be canceled, upon receipt of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal
with respect to the shares of Common Stock represented thereby, and exchanged
for the applicable consideration as provided for, and in accordance with, the
provisions, of this Agreement.

 



 

(k) For the avoidance of doubt and except as otherwise provided in _Section
2.9_, any payments to be made by Buyer, the Holder Representative or the
Escrow Agent to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement
shall be made promptly (i) to the Payment Agent to the extent such payment is
payable in respect of Capital Stock and (ii) to the Surviving Corporation to
the extent such payment is payable in respect of Company Options, and in each
case Buyer shall cause the Payment Agent or the Surviving Corporation, or
Buyer and the Holder Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, to promptly make such payments, less any required Tax withholding
in accordance with _Section 2.6.2(e)_, to the Sellers.

 



 

2.7 **_Escrow Accounts_**. At the Effective Time, Buyer shall pay to Citibank,
N.A. (the " **Escrow Agent** ") to be held and delivered by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the terms and provisions of an escrow agreement to be
entered into among Buyer, the Holder Representative and the Escrow Agent in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the " **Escrow
Agreement** ") (a) an amount equal to $30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Dollars)
(the " **Indemnity Escrow Amount** ") to be deposited into an escrow account
(the " **Indemnity Escrow Account** ") and (b) an amount equal to $500,000.00
(Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) (the " **Adjustment Escrow Amount** " and,
collectively with the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the " **Escrow Amount** ") to
be deposited into an escrow account (the " **Adjustment Escrow Account** ").
The Indemnity Escrow Account shall be established as security for
indemnification obligations of Sellers, as set forth in _Article VIII_ and
any Shortfall Consideration in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, as set
forth in _Section 2.8.2(d)_, and the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be
established as security for any Shortfall Consideration, as set forth in
_Section 2.8.2(d)_.

 



 

2.8 **_Purchase Price Adjustments_**.

 



 

2.8.1. **_Closing Date Adjustment_**. The Company shall deliver to Buyer (a)
at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a statement (the "
**Estimated Closing Statement** "), which shall be prepared in good faith by
the Company, setting forth the CompanyÂ’s good faith estimates (which estimates
shall be subject to the reasonable review of Buyer) of (i) Final Working
Capital (as estimated, " **Estimated Working Capital** "), (ii) Final Company

 



      
 

 



 

Transaction Expenses (as estimated, " **Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses** "), (iii) Final Indebtedness (as estimated, " **Estimated
Indebtedness** "), (iv) the amount of Initial Merger Consideration and the
Initial Distribution derived therefrom and (v) the amount of current
liabilities associated with each of the Excluded Accounts (and separately
identifying the Excluded Payroll Accounts) as of the Closing calculated in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, and (b) at least one (1) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, a statement setting forth, with respect to each
Seller, such SellerÂ’s name and Pro Rata Portion (with respect to the Initial
Distribution and any subsequent Merger Consideration Distributions) and the
number of shares of Capital Stock and vested Company Options owned by such
Seller, in each case as of the Closing and together with reasonable supporting
documentation. In the event that (A) the Estimated Working Capital plus (B)
the amount, if any, by which the Excluded Payroll Accounts Minimum exceeds the
aggregate of the Excluded Payroll Accounts, minus (C) the amount, if any, by
which the aggregate of Excluded Payroll Accounts exceeds the Excluded Payroll
Accounts Maximum, in each case as reflected on the Estimated Closing
Statement, exceeds $10,460,000.00 (Ten Million Four Hundred Sixty Thousand
Dollars) (the " **Working Capital Threshold** "), the Initial Merger
Consideration will be increased by such excess (the " **Excess Payment** ").
In the event that (A) the Estimated Working Capital plus (B) the amount, if
any, by which the Excluded Payroll Accounts Minimum exceeds the aggregate of
the Excluded Payroll Accounts, minus (C) the amount, if any, by which the
aggregate of Excluded Payroll Accounts exceeds the Excluded Payroll Accounts
Maximum, in each case as reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, is less
than the Working Capital Threshold, the Initial Merger Consideration will be
decreased by such shortfall (the " **Shortfall Reduction** "). The Final
Merger Consideration will be subject to further adjustment upon final, post-
Closing determination of the Final Working Capital, Final Company Transaction
Expenses, Final Indebtedness and Excluded Payroll Accounts, as provided in
_Section 2.8.2_. The calculations set forth in this _Section 2.8.1_ shall be
subject to the reasonable review of Buyer and shall reflect any adjustments
reasonably requested by Buyer that are consistent with the requirements of,
and definitions set forth in, this Agreement.

 



 

2.8.2. **_Post-Closing Adjustment_**.

 



 

(a) Within seventy-five (75) days following the Closing Date, Buyer, at its
sole cost and expense, shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Holder
Representative a statement (" **Buyer Â’s Closing Statement**") setting forth
BuyerÂ’s good faith calculations of (a) Final Working Capital, (b) Final
Company Transaction Expenses, (c) Final Indebtedness and (d) the Excluded
Payroll Accounts as of the Closing calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. The Holder Representative and its independent certified
public accountants shall have forty-five (45) days following receipt to review
BuyerÂ’s Closing Statement and make inquiry of the representatives of BuyerÂ’s
accountants, subject to entry into customary non-disclosure and non-reliance
agreements to the extent required by such accountants, and Buyer, who shall
reasonably cooperate with the Holder Representative (including by providing
the Holder Representative or its agents access to financial accounts and
underlying source documents). The calculation regarding the foregoing items
(a) through (d) contained in BuyerÂ’s Closing Statement shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed irrevocably accepted by, the Holder Representative
unless the Holder Representative shall have delivered to Buyer a written
notice (a " **Dispute Notice** ") within forty-five (45) days after receipt of
BuyerÂ’s Closing Statement of any objections to the calculations set forth in
BuyerÂ’s Closing Statement. The

 



      
 

 



 

Dispute Notice must set forth in reasonable detail the basis for any
objections to BuyerÂ’s Closing Statement and the Holder RepresentativeÂ’s good
faith calculation of the disputed amounts (such disputed amounts, the "
**Disputed Amounts** ") in BuyerÂ’s Closing Statement; _provided_ that (i) such
Disputed Amounts may only be based on mathematical errors or non-compliance
with this Agreement (including the relevant definitions) and (ii) the Holder
Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts
included in the BuyerÂ’s Closing Statement except the Disputed Amounts
specifically disputed in a Dispute Notice.

 



 

(b) If a Dispute Notice shall be duly delivered pursuant to _Section
2.8.2(a)_, the Holder Representative and Buyer shall, during the thirty (30)
days following such delivery, attempt to reach agreement on the Disputed
Amounts. Any such agreement shall be in writing and shall be final and binding
upon the Parties and the Sellers. If during such period, the Holder
Representative and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, then all
Disputed Amounts that cannot be resolved by them within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a Dispute Notice pursuant to this _Section 2.8.2(a)_ shall be
referred to Ernst and Young LLP or another independent auditor mutually agreed
by Buyer and the Holder Representative (the " **Disputes Auditor** ") for
decision, which decision shall be final and binding (it being agreed and
understood that the Disputes Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine
such disputed items or amounts and shall do so based solely on presentations
and information provided by Buyer and the Holder Representative and not by
independent review). In conducting its review, the Disputes Auditor shall
consider only the Disputed Amounts and shall not assign a value to any item
greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the minimum value for such item claimed by either party. The scope of the
disputes, if any, to be resolved by the Disputes Auditor shall be limited to
fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the items in dispute were
determined in accordance with this Agreement (including the relevant
definitions) and the Disputes Auditor is not to make any other determination.
The Parties agree that they will request that the Disputes Auditor render its
decision within thirty (30) days after referral of the dispute to the Disputes
Auditor for decision pursuant hereto. Each Party shall bear the fees and
disbursements of their respective representatives incurred in connection with
their preparation or review of the Disputed Amounts. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Disputes Auditor shall be borne by Buyer and the Holder
Representative in proportion to the relative amount each such partyÂ’s
determination has been modified. For example, if the Holder Representative
challenges the calculation of Final Working Capital and claims that the Final
Working Capital should increase by $100,000, but the Disputes Auditor
determines that the Final Working Capital should increase only by $60,000, the
Holder Representative shall bear forty percent (40%) of the fees, costs and
expenses of the Disputes Auditor and Buyer shall bear the other sixty percent
(60%) of such fees and expenses. The date on which the Final Working Capital,
the Final Company Transaction Expenses and Final Indebtedness are finally
determined in accordance with _Section 2.8.2(a)_ and this _Section 2.8.2(b)_
is hereinafter referred to as the " **Final Determination Date**."

 



 

(c) If the Final Merger Consideration calculated in the same manner as the
Initial Merger Consideration, but using Final Working Capital, Final Company
Transaction Expenses, Final Indebtedness and Excluded Payroll Accounts, each
as finally determined pursuant to _Sections 2.8.2(a)_ and _2.8.2(b)_ ,
exceeds the Initial Merger Consideration, then the Sellers shall be entitled
to such excess (the " **Excess Consideration** ") in accordance with _Section
2.8.2(d)_. If the Final Merger Consideration calculated in the same manner as
the Initial Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration, but using Final Working Capital, Final Company Transaction
Expenses, Final Indebtedness and Excluded Payroll Accounts, each as finally
determined pursuant to _Sections 2.8.2(a)_ and _2.8.2(b)_ , is less than the
Initial Merger Consideration, then Buyer shall be entitled to such shortfall
(the " **Shortfall Consideration** ") in accordance with _Section 2.8.2(d)_.
The Final Merger Consideration adjustment required hereby is referred to as
the " **Adjustment**."

 



 

(d) If the Adjustment results in Shortfall Consideration, then within three
(3) Business Days after the Final Determination Date, Buyer and the Holder
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer out of the
Adjustment Escrow Account an amount equal to the Shortfall Consideration;
_provided_ , that if the funds then available in the Adjustment Escrow Account
are less than the Shortfall Consideration, then the excess of the Shortfall
Consideration over the funds then available in the Adjustment Escrow Account
shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account to Buyer; provided, further,
that if the Indemnity Escrow Account is depleted, under no circumstances shall
Buyer be entitled to any further recovery. If the Adjustment results in Excess
Consideration, then, within three (3) Business Days after the Final
Determination Date, subject to _Section 2.6.2(a)_, Buyer will pay the Excess
Consideration to the Payment Agent and the Surviving Corporation, in
accordance with _Section 2.6.2(k)_, for further payment to the Sellers
pursuant to the final sentence of _Section 2.6.1_. If, after all payments
pursuant to this _Section 2.8.2(d)_ have been made, there are funds remaining
in the Adjustment Escrow Account, Buyer and the Holder Representative shall
promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to release all such funds to the Payment
Agent and the Surviving Corporation, in accordance with _Section 2.6.2(k)_,
for further payment to the Sellers pursuant to the final sentence of _Section
2.6.1_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amount payable
under this _Section 2.8.2(d)_ that is taxable as compensation shall be paid
to the Surviving Corporation for distribution in accordance with _Section
2.6.2(d)_, and any amounts distributable pursuant to this _Section 2.8.2(d)_
shall be reduced, in the aggregate, by the employer portion of any applicable
employment, payroll, social security, unemployment or similar Taxes (other
than to the extent such Taxes have already been accounted for in the
calculation of the Excluded Payroll Accounts, included as a Company
Transaction Expense or otherwise resulted in a reduction in Final Merger
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement).

 



 

2.9 **_Holder Expense Fund_**. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay $2,000,000.00
(the " **Holder Expense Fund** ") to an account designated by the Holder
Representative to be held and used solely for the purposes set forth in
_Section 9.3_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Holder
Representative determines in its sole discretion that no further expenses are
expected to be incurred in its capacity as such hereunder, the Holder
Representative shall pay the balance of the Holder Expense Fund, if any,
subject to _Section 2.6.2(a)_, to the Payment Agent and the Surviving
Corporation, in accordance with _Section 2.6.2(k)_, for payment to the
Sellers in accordance with the final sentence of _Section 2.6.1_; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Payment Agent Agreement has been terminated prior to
the Holder RepresentativeÂ’s distribution of the balance of the Holder Expense
Fund, it shall be the Holder RepresentativeÂ’s responsibility to distribute any
amounts payable in respect of Capital Stock to the applicable Sellers (with,
for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts payable in respect of Company Options
to be paid through the Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section
2.6.2(k)_).

 



 

2.10 **_Company Transaction Expenses_**. At the Effective Time, Buyer shall
pay or cause to be paid the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses to the
Persons and in the amounts

 



       
 

 



 

identified in the Estimated Closing Statement, as specified in invoices,
binding fee statements or similar customary evidence of obligations provided
to Buyer by the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as directed in the applicable invoice, fee statement or other
evidence of obligations.

 



 

2.11 **_Company Debt_**. The Company shall provide payoff letters to Buyer, at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (the " **Payoff Letters** "), in respect of
each of the Current Credit Facilities and any other Indebtedness that is by
its terms required to be repaid or is otherwise being repaid in connection
with the Closing, in each case providing that, upon the payment of the amount
specified in such Payoff Letters, the Indebtedness will be fully extinguished
and all related contracts and instruments will be terminated (except for
lender indemnities and similar provisions that customarily survive repayment
in accordance with the terms of such contracts or instruments), any related
Liens and guarantees will automatically be released, and granting the Company
(and the Surviving Corporation) or any of the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective representatives the authority to file any appropriate Lien release
documents, and containing such other terms as are customary for transactions
similar to the transactions contemplated hereby. At the Effective Time, Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid the Indebtedness to the Persons and in the
amounts specified in the Payoff Letters by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as directed in the Payoff Letters.

 



 

2.12 **_Closing; Closing Deliveries_**.

shares of Common Stock. As of the date hereof, 2,100,000 shares of Common

authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and to perform all
of its obligations under each agreement and instrument by which it is bound.
Each of Buyer and Merger Sub is duly licensed or qualified to do business, and
in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not be materially adverse to
Buyer and Merger Sub, taken as a whole.

 



 

4.2 **_Corporate Authorization_**. The Board of Directors or comparable
governing body of each of Buyer and Merger Sub has approved and adopted this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with
applicable Laws. Buyer, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved
and adopted this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL. Each of Buyer and
Merger Sub has the requisite power and authority to enter into and deliver
this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which it is a party and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer and Merger Sub of this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to which either is a party and the consummation by
Buyer and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate,
limited liability company or partnership action on the part of Buyer and
Merger Sub, and no further action or proceeding is required on the part of
Buyer or Merger Sub, or their respective boards of directors or stockholders,
to authorize this Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which

including the Merger. This Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to
which Buyer or Merger Sub is a party has been or, to the extent applicable,
will be duly and validly executed and delivered by Buyer and Merger Sub.
Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other Parties
and the validity and binding effect hereof on the other Parties, this
Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which Buyer or Merger Sub
are a party constitutes or, to the extent applicable, will constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Buyer and Merger Sub
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, in each case except as
such enforceability may be limited by the Laws of general application relating
to bankruptcy and insolvency and the relief of debtors and rules of Law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies.

 



 

4.3 **_No Conflict_**. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents by Buyer and Merger Sub does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
compliance with the provisions hereof and thereof will not, result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Buyer or Merger
Sub or conflict with, constitute or result in any violation or default (with
or without notice or passage of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, modification,

 



      
 

 



 

cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, under (i) any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws or comparable organizational documents
of Buyer or Merger Sub, (ii) any material mortgage, indenture, loan or credit
agreement, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument, permit,
concession, franchise or license to which Buyer or Merger Sub or any of their

approval, waiver, order, permit or authorization of, or notice, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution, delivery
or performance by Buyer or Merger Sub of this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents to which either is a party or the consummation by Buyer or Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents.

 



 

4.5 **_Litigation_**. There are no Legal Proceedings pending against or
affecting Buyer or Merger Sub or their respective assets, which, if determined
adversely, would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of
Buyer or Merger Sub to enter into and perform its obligations under this

Governmental Entity binding upon Buyer or Merger Sub which would reasonably be
expected to materially impair the ability of Buyer or Merger Sub to enter into
and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

4.6 **_Financing_**. Subject to _Section 10.7_, each of Buyer and Merger Sub
acknowledges that its obligations under this Agreement are not contingent upon
or subject to any conditions regarding their ability to obtain financing in
connection with the consummation of the Merger. Concurrently with or prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to the
Company a correct and complete copy of a debt commitment letter (together,
along with any amendments, replacements (in whole or in part) exhibits,
annexes and schedules thereof, the " **Debt Commitment Letter** "), dated as

its Affiliates, permitted assigns pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and
any other financial institutions that become a party to the Debt Commitment
Letter in accordance with the terms thereof, the " **Debt Financing Sources**
") and Buyer, pursuant to which, but subject to the terms and conditions of
which, the Debt Financing Sources have committed to provide or cause to be
provided debt financing to Buyer in the amounts set forth therein (the "
**Debt Financing** "). Assuming the Debt Financing is funded at the Closing

Date all funds necessary to (i) pay the Initial Merger Consideration and all
other amounts payable hereunder as of the Closing, (ii) pay any fees and

knowledge of Buyer, the Debt Financing Sources. Buyer has fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be

of the counterparties to the Debt Commitment Letter to fund the commitments
thereunder are not subject to any conditions precedent other than as set forth

Letter has notified Buyer in writing of its intention to (i) terminate the
commitment set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or (ii) not provide the
full amount of the Debt Financing at Closing as contemplated by the applicable
Debt Commitment Letter (subject to the terms of, and following the
satisfaction of, the conditions set forth therein). As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) would
constitute a breach or default under the Debt Commitment Letter by Buyer or,
to the knowledge of Buyer, the Debt Financing Sources.

or Merger Sub incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for brokerage or

representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Transmittal
Documents and each other Transaction Document, none of the Company or any
other Person has made any express or implied representation or warranty,
either written or oral, to Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to the matters
or transactions contemplated hereby, including any representation or warranty
as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company or
any Company Subsidiary furnished or made available to Buyer or its Affiliates
or any of their respective representatives (including any information,

site established on behalf of the Company, management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby), or as to
any financial projection or forecast regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby or the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries furnished
or made available to Buyer or its Affiliates.

own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, results of
operations, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and have been provided reasonable access

other antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law and shall permit the
other Parties to review in advance (and to consider any comments made by the
other Parties in relation to) any proposed communication by such Party to any
Governmental Entity relating to such matters. No Party shall agree to
participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Parties the opportunity
to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or discussion.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties shall coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods including under the HSR Act. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Parties shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that materials may be redacted (a) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements, and (b) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

 



 

5.3.5. Until receipt of all authorizations, approvals or consents under the
HSR Act required for the consummation of the Merger, Buyer shall not enter
into any agreement or transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that
would reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to
materially increase the time required, to (a) obtain the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, or any other antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order that would materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (c) obtain
all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Entities
referenced in _Sections 6.1.4_ or _6.2.5_.

 



 

5.4 **_Inspection_**. Subject to (i) applicable Laws and doctrines of
attorney-client privilege and (ii) confidentiality obligations and similar
restrictions applicable to information furnished to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries by third Persons that prohibit disclosure to Buyer or its
accountants, counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and other
representatives, during the period from the date hereof through the Closing,
the Company shall afford to Buyer and its accountants, counsel, financial
advisors, financing sources and other representatives reasonable access to,
during normal business hours, all of the CompanyÂ’s and the Company
SubsidiariesÂ’ employees, officers, agents, offices and properties and permit
them to make such inspections as they may reasonably require of all of the
CompanyÂ’s and the Company SubsidiariesÂ’ books, contracts, commitments and
records; _provided_ , that, all requests for access

 



      
 

 



 

(including any requests for access to employees) shall be directed only to
Geoffrey Coutts of Houlihan Lokey (it being understood that Buyer will not
attempt to contact any employees, customers or suppliers of the Company except
pursuant to reasonable procedures and constraints mutually agreed (which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) upon by
the Holder Representative and Buyer). All information obtained pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with _Section
5.6_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) minimize the effects of the
restrictions referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 5.4_ and (y)
to the extent such restrictions prevent access reasonably requested by Buyer
or its accountants, counsel, financial advisors, financing sources and other
representatives, provide a reasonable alternative to such access.

 



 

5.5 **_Public Disclosure_**. Unless otherwise required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or the rules or
regulations of, any national securities exchange or stock market (in which
case the Party required to make the disclosure will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other Parties reasonable opportunity to
participate in crafting the disclosure), no disclosure (whether or not in
response to an inquiry) of the fact or subject matter of this Agreement (or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby) shall be made by any Party at any
time other than to agents and representatives of the Parties as necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless approved in
writing by the other Parties prior to release, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Debt Financing Sources, their representatives and BuyerÂ’s
professional advisors may (i) publish "tombstones" or other customary
announcements which do not contain pricing details that are not otherwise
publicly available and (ii) make public statements or communications in
connection with the Debt Financing (or any Alternate Debt Financing) so long
as such statements or communications are afforded confidential treatment to
the same extent as other confidential information customarily provided to
Persons in the context of similar financings. For the avoidance of doubt,
disclosures resulting from the partiesÂ’ efforts to obtain approval or early
termination under the HSR Act and to make any related filing shall be deemed
not to violate this Agreement.

 



 

5.6 **_Confidentiality_**. The Confidentiality Agreement dated November 2,
2015 previously executed by Buyer (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** ")
shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the execution of this
Agreement; _provided_ that (a) for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing
Sources (and any sources of Alternate Debt Financing) shall be considered
"Representatives" under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and (b)
Buyer and its Affiliates shall be permitted to make any disclosures required
by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or rules or
regulations of, any national securities exchange or stock market. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and be of no further
force or effect as of the Effective Time.

 



 

5.7 **_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein (including
in _Sections 5.3_ , _5.8_ and _9.3_ ), whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including all legal, accounting, investment banking, broker, financial
advisory, consulting and other fees and expenses of third Persons incurred by
a Party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

5.8 **_Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_**. Until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Closing, Buyer agrees that it will cause the
Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary (1) not to amend, repeal or
modify any agreement entered into between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any present or former director, manager or officer set forth on
_Section 5.8_ of the Disclosure Schedule, or any provision in the CompanyÂ’s
or any of the Company SubsidiariesÂ’ organizational documents, in each case as
in existence on the date hereof, providing for the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses of any present and former director,
manager and officer (as applicable) of the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary (unless and to the extent required by Law), and (2) to continue to
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, manager and
officer (as applicable) of the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary as
provided as of the date hereof in the agreements and organizational documents
referenced in (1) above. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall obtain
as of the Closing Date a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six
(6) years from the Closing Date with at least the same coverage and amounts,
and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the
directors, managers and officers (as applicable) of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary, as the directors and officers insurance policy or policies
in effect as of the date of this Agreement, in each case with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the
Closing Date (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement). The premium for such insurance policy shall be a Company
Transaction Expense. The present and former directors, managers and officers
of the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall be and are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

5.9 **_Commercially Reasonable Efforts_**. Subject to the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do
promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consents, waivers or approvals, as applicable, in respect of each of
the Required Consent Leases prior to Closing. The Required Consent Leases and
the 4-Wall EBITDA of the clinics covered by each such Lease are set forth on
_Schedule 5.9_.

 



 

5.10 **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

5.10.1. **_Cooperation; Audits; Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns and any Tax Contest for
any taxable period ending before or including the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Holder Representative, on the other
hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including the furnishing or
making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as
reasonably required, with reasonable advance notice and during normal business
hours), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials reasonably
necessary for the preparation of such Tax Returns and the conduct or the
defense of any Tax Contest. The Surviving Corporation (i) shall retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date and (ii) give the Holder Representative
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and allow the Holder

 



      
 

 



 

Representative to take possession of such books and records, in each case
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any
extensions).

 



 

(b) Buyer and the Holder Representative shall, upon the otherÂ’s request, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). Buyer shall cause the tax
year of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to end at the
end of the day on the Closing Date for federal and applicable state, and local
income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted under applicable Law. Buyer will
file consolidated U.S. federal income Tax Returns with each of the Surviving
Corporation and its corporate Subsidiaries for the taxable period beginning
immediately after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. In the case of any
Income Tax Return of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be
prepared all such Tax Returns in a manner, and pursuant to principles,
consistent with similar Tax Returns for prior periods, except as required by
applicable Law. The Surviving Corporation shall send a draft of any such Tax
Return to the Holder Representative at least thirty (30) days before the due
date for such Tax Return (including any applicable extensions) for the Holder
RepresentativeÂ’s review and comment. The Surviving Corporation shall
incorporate any reasonable comments of the Holder Representative to such Tax
Return, but only to the extent such comments are received no later than ten
(10) days prior to the due date for such Tax Return (including any applicable
extensions) and relate to Taxes that would be payable or indemnifiable by the
Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. For any Tax Return (which Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner, and pursuant to principles, consistent
with similar Tax Returns for prior periods, except as required by applicable
Law) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period that is not an Income Tax Return, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide the Holder Representative with calculations and appropriate
documentation of the amount of any Taxes owed by Sellers with respect to such
Tax Return (determined in accordance with the principles of _Section
5.10.6_), subject to the review and consent of the Holder Representative (not
to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) (each, a " **Non-Income
Tax Calculation** ").

 



 

(d) The Holder Representative and Buyer shall (i) in the case of any Tax
Return described in the second sentence of _Section 5.10.1(c)_, cause the
Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnity
Escrow Account an amount equal to any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return
(other than any Taxes that reduce Final Merger Consideration on account of
their inclusion in Net Working Capital) no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the due date for such Tax Return (including applicable extensions)
and (ii) in the case of any Tax Return described in the last sentence of
_Section 5.10.1(c)_, cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation from the Indemnity Escrow Account an amount equal to any Taxes
shown as allocable to the Sellers on the relevant Non-Income Tax Calculation,
as consented to by the Holder Representative pursuant to _Section 5.10.1(c)_
(other than any Taxes that reduce Final Merger Consideration on account of
their inclusion in Net Working Capital) no later than ten (10) days after
receiving notice from the Surviving Corporation of the amount of such Taxes.
Any Taxes described in the last sentence of _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _5.10.1(c)_ that are not paid pursuant to _Section 5.10.1(d)(ii)_ may be
submitted in a Claim Notice pursuant to _Section 8.4.2_.

 



 

5.10.2. **_Controversies_**. Notwithstanding any conflicting provisions in
_Article VIII_, this _Section 5.10.2_ shall control any Tax Contest relating
to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of the Surviving
Corporation and the Holder Representative shall promptly notify the other
Party of its receipt (or any of its AffiliateÂ’s receipt) of any notice of any
Tax Contest relating to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
from any Governmental Entity. The Holder Representative may participate in
and, upon written notice to the Surviving Corporation, assume the defense of
any such Tax Contest that would reasonably be expected to cause a material
indemnification obligation of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 8.2_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative will not have the
right to assume the defense of a Tax Contest for a Straddle Period. If the
Holder Representative assumes such defense, the Holder Representative shall
have the authority, with respect to any such Tax Contest, to represent the
interests of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries before the
relevant Governmental Entity and the Holder Representative shall have the
right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax
Contest subject to the limitations contained herein, including responding to
inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, such Tax Contest; provided, that the Holder Representative
will not be entitled to settle or otherwise close any such Tax Contest without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed. The Surviving Corporation shall provide the
Holder Representative with any documentation or authorizations necessary for
the Holders Representative to have the foregoing powers. The Surviving
Corporation shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the
defense of such Tax Contest and to employ counsel, solely at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Holder Representative. The Holder
Representative shall keep the Surviving Corporation reasonably informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Contest, and
will, in good faith, allow the Surviving Corporation to consult with it
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding. If the
Holder Representative chooses not to assume (or is otherwise not permitted to
assume) the defense of a Tax Contest, the Surviving Corporation shall assume
such defense in good faith. In such event, the Surviving Corporation shall
keep the Holder Representative reasonably informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Contest and shall not enter
into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax Contest to the
extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is indemnifiable pursuant to
_Section 8.2_ without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

 



 

5.10.3. **_Amendment of Tax Returns_**. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor
any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax
Return or Tax election of the Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including, in each case, pursuant or with respect to any voluntary disclosure
or similar program) if such amendment, refiling, revocation or other action
would reasonably be expected to increase Taxes that would be payable or
indemnifiable by the Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each
case without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.10.3_ shall not

 



      
 

 



 

apply to any amendment, refiling, revocation or other action related to
escheat or any other Law with respect to unclaimed property.

 



 

5.10.4. **_Transfer Taxes_**. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest and any costs or fees related to any related Tax Returns) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be borne
equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
when due, and all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to such Taxes and fees will be prepared and filed by the party required to
file such Tax Returns in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

5.10.5. **_Refunds and Credits_**. Except to the extent included in the
calculation of Final Working Capital, any income Tax refund received by the
Surviving Corporation (or any of its Affiliates), and any credits in lieu of
refunds to which the Surviving Corporation (or any of its Affiliates) shall
become entitled, in each case of or with respect to income arising in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, shall be for the account of the Sellers, and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay over to the Payment Agent and the Surviving Corporation,
in accordance with _Section 2.6.2(k)_, for payment to the Sellers pursuant to
the final sentence of _Section 2.6.1_ an amount equal to such refund or
credit within ten (10) days after receipt or utilization thereof. Any amount
payable under this _Section 5.10.5_ that is taxable as compensation shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation for distribution in accordance with _Section
2.6.2(d)_ and, to the extent applicable, _Section 2.6.2(e)_; provided, that,
consistent with _Section 8.2.4(a)_, to the extent any Buyer Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2.1(d)_, Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation may set-off, in satisfaction of such indemnification,
any payment otherwise required to be made to the Payment Agent or the
Surviving Corporation for the benefit of the Sellers under this _Section
5.10.5_ on a dollar-for-dollar basis (it being understood that the amount of
such set-off shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis such indemnification
obligation of Sellers).

 



 

5.10.6. **_Allocation of Certain Taxes_**. In the case of any Straddle Period,
the amount of (a) any Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary based on
or measured by income, gross or net sales, payroll, or payments or receipts
for such taxable period shall be allocated to the pre-Closing and post-Closing
portion of such Straddle Period based on an interim closing of the books as of
the end of the day on the Closing Date (excluding, solely for purposes of this
clause (a), taxable items arising on the Closing Date, but after the Closing,
on account of any transaction not in the ordinary course of business) and (b)
any real property, personal property, ad valorem or other similar Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for such Straddle Period shall be allocated
to the pre-Closing and post-Closing period on a per diem basis (excluding,
solely for purposes of this clause (b), any such Taxes arising as a result of
the reassessment of property resulting from transactions occurring on the
Closing Date, but not before the Closing, or after the Closing Date).

 



 

5.10.7. **_FIRPTA Compliance_**. At or prior to the Closing, the Holder
Representative shall deliver to Buyer a certificate, which complies in form
and substance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)
and acceptable to Buyer, so that Buyer is exempt from withholding with respect
to any amount paid hereunder pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3)(i).

 



      
 

 



 

5.10.8. **_Adjustment to Purchase Price_**. Except as required by applicable
Law, any payment by Buyer, any Seller or the Holder Representative, as the
case may be, pursuant to _Sections 2.8.2_ and _5.10.5_ , and _Article VIII_,
will be treated as an adjustment to the Initial Merger Consideration for
applicable Tax purposes

 



 

5.10.9. **_Section 280G_**.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) secure from each Person who has
a right or potential right to any payments or benefits under any Company
Employee Plan or otherwise that is "contingent " (within the meaning of Code
Section 280G) on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that
would constitute a "parachute payment " (within the meaning of Code Section
280G) a waiver, subject to the approval described in clause (ii), of such
PersonÂ’s rights to all of such parachute payments (the " **Waived 280G
Benefits** ") and (ii) solicit the approval of the stockholders of the
Company, to the extent and in the manner required under Code Section
280G(b)(5)(B) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, of any Waived 280G
Benefits. Any of the Waived 280G Benefits which fail to be approved by the
stockholders of the Company as contemplated above shall not be made or
provided.

 



 

(b) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to distributing any waivers,
consents or other stockholder voting materials, the Company shall provide
Buyer with its Section 280G calculations and copies of all such materials and
Buyer shall have the right to review and comment on all such documents and
materials (with such reasonable comments to be considered by the Company in
good faith).

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer evidence
that a vote of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders was solicited in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 5.10.9_ and that either (i) the requisite number
of stockholder votes was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits
(the " **280G Approval** "), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained.
Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be deemed to require, any specific
outcome of the stockholder vote described in _Section 5.10.9(a)_.

 



 

5.11 **_Employees; Benefit Plans._**

 



 

5.11.1. The Company shall terminate its 401(k) Plan (the " **401(k) Plan**")
no later than the day prior to the Closing Date, by resolution adopted by the
CompanyÂ’s board of directors which indicates the specific date, month and year
of termination, on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and simultaneously
amend the 401(k) Plan to the extent necessary to comply with all applicable
Laws to the extent not previously amended and to permit participants in the
401(k) Plan to rollover any outstanding loan promissory notes to a qualified
plan of another employer. Prior to adopting any such resolutions or
amendments to the 401(k) Plan, Buyer shall have the right to review and
comment on same (with such reasonable comments to be considered by the Company
in good faith). At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certified
copy of such resolutions of the CompanyÂ’s board of directors. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing (and after all required testing has
been performed and corrective contributions and distributions, if any, have
been made), but in no event later than the one-year anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to take all
actions necessary to wind up the 401(k) Plan. If any amounts accrued

 



       
 

 



 

under the 401(k) Plan are withheld from the 401(k) Plan participantsÂ’
paychecks three (3) Business Days or less prior to the Closing Date, and if
such amounts are not remitted to the 401(k) Plan by the Company prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to remit such amounts to
the 401(k) Plan.

 



 

5.11.2. During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the last day
of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs (or if earlier, the date of
the employeeÂ’s termination of employment with the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries), Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to provide each employee who is employed by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary as of the Closing and who remains employed by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing (each a "
**Continuing Employee** ") with (i) the base salary and annual cash bonus
opportunity (but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any change in control
or transaction bonus opportunity), if any, that is no less favorable than that
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii)
except with respect to any compensation or benefits payable under any equity
or equity-based incentive plan or arrangement, defined benefit pension plan or
arrangement or change in control plan or arrangement, other employee benefits
that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided to
similarly situated employees of the Buyer during such period. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.11.2_ shall be deemed to limit
or modify the obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to comply
with any change in control or transaction bonus relating to any change of
control or transaction entered into after the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms of any contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

5.11.3. With respect to any employee benefit plan (other than any plan that
provides for equity awards, defined benefit pension benefits or change in
control benefits) maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing,
(collectively, " **Buyer Benefit Plans** ") in which any Continuing Employees
will participate effective as of the Closing and for which eligibility depends
on length of service, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
any applicable Subsidiary thereof to, recognize all service of the Continuing
Employees with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of and through the
Closing Date to the extent recognized under a comparable Company Employee
Plan, as if such service were with Buyer or its Affiliates, solely for
eligibility (but not vesting) purposes under any such Buyer Benefit Plan;
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

 



 

5.11.4. This _Section 5.11_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
5.11_, express or implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or any
other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this _Section 5.11_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied,
shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, nor shall this _Section 5.11_ be deemed to limit
the right of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates from modifying, terminating or
amending any Company Employee Plan after the Closing. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 5.11_ shall not create
any right in

 



      
 

 



 

any employee, any Continuing Employee or any other Person to any continued
employment or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



 

5.12 **_Conflict and Privilege Matters._**

 



 

5.12.1. **_Waiver of Conflicts_**. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer hereby
waives and agrees not to assert, and Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising out of or relating to any representation after
the Closing of the Holder Representative, any Seller, any of their respective
Affiliates (any such Person, a " **Designated Person** ") in any matter
involving this Agreement or any agreement, certificate, instrument or other
document executed or delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby (including any litigation, arbitration,
mediation or other proceeding and including any matter regarding the
negotiation, execution, performance or enforceability hereof or thereof) by
any legal counsel to the extent such legal counsel has represented, or will
represent prior to the Closing, any Designated Person, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate, instrument or other document executed or delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (including
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof).

 



 

5.12.2. **_Attorney-Client Privilege._** The attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection and expectation of client confidence arising
from each legal counselÂ’s representation of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary, any Seller or the Holder Representative, as applicable, prior to
the Closing in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and all information and documents reflecting such
privilege or protected communication, shall belong to and be controlled by the
applicable Sellers or the Holder Representative, as applicable, and may be
waived only by the applicable Sellers or Holder Representative, as applicable,
and not the Company, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Buyer, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

5.13 **_Payment Agent and Surviving Corporation_** **.**

 



 

5.13.1. Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall engage the Payment Agent
pursuant to the Payment Agent Agreement, and shall cause the Payment Agent to
take all action and to do all things which the Payment Agent is required to do
under this Agreement.

 



 

5.13.2. From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make all payments which the Surviving Corporation is required
to pay under this Agreement.

 



 

5.14 **_Financing._**

 



 

5.14.1. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
(taking into account the relevant "market flex " provisions of the Fee Letter
(as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter)), including using its reasonable
best efforts to (a) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with its terms, (b) satisfy all

 



      
 

 



 

conditions and covenants in the Debt Commitment Letter that are a condition to
the funding thereunder, in each case, that are within its control, (c) enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account any "market
flex " provisions set forth in the Fee Letter), and (d) consummate the Debt
Financing at or prior to Closing on substantially the terms and conditions of
the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

5.14.2. Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto, if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (a) reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing
(unless, if required to effect the Closing on the terms set forth herein,
Buyer agrees to use its cash on hand) or (b) impose new or additional
conditions or other terms or otherwise materially expand, amend or modify any
of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing or other terms in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (i) materially delay, impair or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) make, in any material respect, the timely funding of the Debt Financing
or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing materially
less likely to occur or (iii) adversely impact, in any material respect, the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or to draw upon and consummate the Debt Financing.

 



 

5.14.3. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters (other than due to
the failure of a condition to the consummation of the Debt Financing resulting
from a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Company or Holder Representative set forth in this Agreement), Buyer shall, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain from alternative sources
alternative financing on terms and conditions that are not materially less
favorable to Buyer (taking into account the relevant "market flex" provisions
set forth in the Fee Letter), taken as a whole, than those set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter in an amount at least equal to the Debt Financing or
such unavailable portion thereof (the " **Alternate Debt Financing** "), and
to obtain a new commitment letter with respect to such Alternate Debt
Financing (the " **New Debt Commitment Letter** "), a copy of which shall be
promptly provided to the Company. In the event any New Debt Commitment Letter
is obtained, (a) any reference in this Agreement to the Debt Financing shall
mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to subsection (b) below, and (b) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letter or Letters that are not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at
the time in question and the New Debt Commitment Letter or Letters to the
extent then in effect.

 



 

5.14.4. Upon written request by the Company from time to time, Buyer shall
apprise the Company on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail
with respect to all material activity concerning the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall notify
the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days after it
becomes aware thereof, (a) of any breach or default by any party to any Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements with respect thereto, (b) of the
receipt by Buyer of any written notice or other communication (other than
negotiations of the definitive

 



      
 

 



 

agreements with respect to the Debt Financing) from any Debt Financing Source
with respect to any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement related thereto of
any provision of any Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with
respect thereto or (c) if for any reason Buyer no longer believes in good
faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing.
Buyer shall not enter into any agreement or undertaking that would reasonably
be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the
Financing.

 



 

5.14.5. The Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives shall, at BuyerÂ’s expense, use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate in connection with the arranging, obtaining, syndication and
consummation of any Debt Financing (including any Alternate Debt Financing)
being arranged by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection herewith as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer or the Debt Financing Sources (provided, that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries); including reasonable
best efforts with respect to (i) promptly providing to Buyer and the Debt
Financing Sources the Required Bank Information and such other reasonably
available financial and other information regarding the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries as required under the Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise
reasonably requested by the Buyer, any Debt Financing Source or prospective
lender in order to syndicate or consummate the Debt Financing and delivering
customary authorization letters in connection with the information memoranda,
investor presentations, rating agency memoranda and similar documents,
including, if the Closing has not occurred prior to March 30, 2016, audited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for the year ending December 31, 2015, (ii) furnishing at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date all required documentation and other
information required by applicable governmental authorities under applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2011, but in each case solely relating to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, (iii) reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral on the Closing Date with respect to
any pledge or grant that becomes effective on or after the Closing Date, (iv)
reasonably assisting in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings and
ratings in respect of the Debt Financing from any rating agencies contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, (v) obtaining customary consents of accountants
for the use of their audit reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing and (vi) obtaining lien releases at the expense of and as reasonably
requested by the Buyer or any Debt Financing Source. The Company hereby
consents to the use of all of its and the Company SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other
provision set forth herein, the Company agrees that the Buyer may share non-
public or confidential information regarding the Company and its business with
the Debt Financing Sources, and that such Debt Financing Sources may share
such information with potential financing sources in connection with any
marketing efforts (including any syndication) in connection with the Debt
Financing, provided that (i) the recipients of such information agree to
customary confidentiality arrangements and (ii) the Buyer will be responsible
for any actions (or inactions) by such recipients that would be deemed a
breach of the Confidentiality Agreement as if Buyer had so acted (or not
acted).

 



      
 

 



 

5.14.6. Buyer shall, promptly upon the written request of the Company or the
Holder Representative reimburse the Company or the Holder Representative for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party costs and expenses
incurred by the Company or the Holder Representative or any of their
representatives in connection with the cooperation provided for in _Section
5.14.5_ (such reimbursement to be made promptly and in any event within three
(3) Business Days of delivery of reasonably acceptable documentation
evidencing such costs and expenses) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Holder Representative and their respective representatives from
and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company, the
Holder Representative or any of their respective representatives or to the
extent such Losses result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
any of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Holder Representative or
their respective representatives). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or
similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Closing for which it is not reimbursed by Buyer.

such date the Company shall deliver to Buyer (a) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2015 together with consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, together with appropriate notes to such financial
statements and accompanied by the report of the CompanyÂ’s independent public

a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the chief financial officer

been cured within ten (10) days after receipt by the Buyer of written notice
from the Company of such breach or inaccuracy;

 



 

7.1.5. by Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ shall
have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived in writing
by Buyer;

 



 

7.1.6. by the Company if any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_
(other than the condition set forth in _Section 6.1.5_) shall have become
incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived in writing by the
Company and the Holder Representative;

 



 

7.1.7. by the Company if (a) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_

Buyer performs its obligations hereunder and the Debt Financing is funded then
the Company will cause the Closing to occur and (c) Buyer fails to consummate
the Closing within two (2) Business Days after the delivery of the
confirmation by the Company required by the foregoing _clause (b)_ ;
_provided_ , that such conditions in _Article VI_ remain satisfied and such

second (2nd) Business Day; and

 



 

7.1.8. by Buyer if the Stockholder Consent or the Required Stockholder

7.2 **_Manner and Effect of Termination_**.

 



 

7.2.1. Termination under this _Article VII_ shall be effected by the giving
of written notice by Company, Holder Representative or Buyer (as applicable)
to the other Parties, which written notice shall specify the provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in
reasonable detail. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided
in _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall
be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company
or their respective officers, directors or securityholders; _provided_ , that
the provisions of _Sections 5.5_ (public disclosure), _5.6_ (confidentiality),
_5.7_ (expenses) and _5.14.6_ (financing indemnity) and _Article VII_
(termination) and _Article X_ (general provisions) shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, subject to _Section 7.2.3_, nothing contained in this
_Section 7.2_ shall relieve any Party from any liability for any Intentional
Breach that occurs prior to the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1.7_ or Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1.2_ at a time when (a) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_
are satisfied or waived (except for those conditions which by their nature are
to be satisfied at Closing, which conditions would have been satisfied
assuming a Closing would occur), (b) Buyer and Merger Sub have received the
Required Bank Information and any audit opinion included in the Required Bank
Information shall not have been withdrawn, and (c) the Required Bank
Information, taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
such Required Bank Information not misleading and, in each case, the reason
that Buyer and Merger Sub failed to consummate the Closing is that the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters was not available to be
drawn down pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter at the time the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to this Agreement (other than as a
result of Intentional Breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub and
other than the exercise of rights pursuant to _Section 5.14.6_), then the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Holder Representative, the
Sellers and any other Person against Buyer or any of the Buyer Related Parties
with respect to the Transaction Matters shall be to receive payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.2.2_.

 



       
 

 



 

7.2.2. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1.7_ or Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1.2_ at a time when (a) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_
are satisfied or waived (except for those conditions which by their nature are
to be satisfied at Closing, which conditions would have been satisfied
assuming a Closing would occur), (b) Buyer and Merger Sub have received the
Required Bank Information and any audit opinion included in the Required Bank
Information has not been withdrawn, and (c) the Required Bank Information,
taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make such Required Bank
Information not misleading, Buyer shall pay to the Company an amount in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds equal to the Termination Fee,
which shall be paid promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
after the effective date of such termination. In no event shall Buyer and
Merger Sub together be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
(1) occasion at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different
events.

 



 

7.2.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
and except in the case of an Intentional Breach and for the exercise of rights
pursuant to _Section 5.14.6_, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1.7_ or Buyer terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1.2_ at a time when (a) all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.2_ are satisfied or waived (except for those conditions
which by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, which conditions would
have been satisfied assuming a Closing would occur), (b) Buyer and Merger Sub
have received the Required Bank Information and any audit opinion included in
the Required Bank Information has not been withdrawn, and (c) the Required
Bank Information, taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
such Required Bank Information not misleading and, in either case, Buyer pays
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.2.2_, (a) the actual receipt by
the Company of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages
and payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company, the Holder Representative, the Sellers and any other Person
against Buyer or any of the Buyer Related Parties with respect to the
Transaction Matters, (b) neither Buyer nor any of the Buyer Related Parties
shall have any other liability or obligation for any or all Losses suffered or
incurred by the Company, the Holder Representative, the Sellers or any other
Person arising out of or in connection with any of the Transaction Matters and
(c) neither the Company, the Holder Representative, any Seller nor any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or
proceeding against Buyer or any of the Buyer Related Parties arising out of or
in connection with any of the Transaction Matters.

 



 

7.2.4. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company, the Holder Representative and
the Sellers shall be entitled to pursue both a grant of specific performance
under _Section 10.7_ and the payment of the Termination Fee under _Section
7.2.2_, but under no circumstances shall the Holder Representative, the
Sellers or the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance under _Section 10.7_ and the payment of the Termination
Fee under _Section 7.2.2_.

 



 

7.2.5. The agreements contained in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. In light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual

 



      
 

 



 

damages with respect to the foregoing matters, the Termination Fee constitutes
a reasonable estimate of the Losses that will be suffered if this Agreement or
if the Merger are otherwise abandoned or not consummated and constitutes
liquidated damages (and not a penalty). The Buyer Related Parties shall be and
are third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.2_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII** ** _

or contribution arising out of, deriving from or relating to a complaint,
petition, action, cause of action, suit, demand, claim or any form of legal
process (including discovery) commenced by the Litigation Trust (collectively,
" **Buyer Losses** ").

 



 

8.2.2. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except in the case of
fraud), (a) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for
the first Buyer Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees would have otherwise
been entitled to indemnification under _Section 8.2.1(a)_ but for the
application of this _Section 8.2.2_ up to an aggregate amount equal to
$2,800,000.00 (Two Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars) (the "
**Deductible** "), and, once aggregate Buyer Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnitees would have otherwise been entitled to indemnification under
_Section 8.2.1(a)_ are in excess of such amount, then the Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitees shall be entitled, subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, to indemnification only for the amount of Buyer Losses for which
the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification under _Section
8.2.1(a)_ in excess of the Deductible and (b) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2.1(a)_ for any single
claim or aggregated claims arising out of substantially the same events or
circumstances unless the amount of such claim or aggregated claims arising out
of substantially the same events or circumstances exceeds $67,500 (Sixty-Seven
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars).

 



 

8.2.3. Solely with respect to Buyer Losses validly claimed pursuant to
_Section 8.2.1(a)_: (a) the sole source of indemnification or recourse shall
be the Indemnity Escrow Account, (b) the aggregate amount of such Buyer Losses
for which the Buyer Indemnitees shall be indemnified shall not exceed the
amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account and (c) for the avoidance of
doubt, no Buyer Indemnitee shall have any recourse directly to any Seller.

 



 

8.2.4. With respect to Buyer Losses claimed pursuant to _Sections 8.2.1(b)_
through _(j)_ : (a) Buyer agrees that it shall first seek a remedy from the
Indemnity Escrow Account, to the extent of the amount then held and not
reserved in the Indemnity Escrow Account (or, in the case of _Section
8.2.1(d)_ and in BuyerÂ’s sole discretion, as a set-off to payments of income
Tax refunds otherwise payable under _Section 5.10.5_) before seeking to
recover any such Buyer Losses directly from the Sellers, and (b) only if all
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account have been distributed or reserved, each
Seller shall be severally, but not jointly, liable for such Buyer Losses in an
amount equal to the product of (x) the amount of such Buyer Losses and (y) a
fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the total net proceeds received
by such Seller under this Agreement and (ii) the denominator of which shall be
the total net proceeds received by all Sellers under this Agreement, in each
case determined as of the time such indemnification obligation is satisfied.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event (except in
the case of fraud by the particular Seller) shall any Seller be liable under
this Article VIII in the aggregate for more than an amount equal to the total
net proceeds received by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

8.2.5. Any amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (except for the
amounts corresponding to any pending claims or payments for Buyer Losses for
which a Claim Notice has been given in accordance with the requirements of
this _Article VIII_, including amounts segregated as contemplated in _Section

date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date.

 



 

8.2.6. The amount of any and all Buyer Losses indemnifiable under this
Agreement shall be reduced to the extent such Loss was taken into account in
the determination of the Final Working Capital, the Estimated or Final Company
Transaction Expenses or the Estimated or Final Indebtedness. In the event that
an insurance, indemnification or other recovery or redress is made by the
Buyer Indemnitee, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to
any Losses for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder and has
received or retained funds in the amount of the Losses, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Indemnity
Escrow Account or the Sellers, as applicable. "Buyer Losses" shall include any
cost associated with pursuing insurance proceeds, policies and/or providers,
including any retention, deductible or co-pay, out-of-pocket

 



      
 

 



 

costs and any increase in premium payable by the Buyer, Buyer Indemnitee or
any of their respective Affiliates or any retroactive adjustment under any
such insurance.

 



 

8.2.7. Buyer shall, and shall cause all Buyer Indemnitees to, take all steps
required by Law to mitigate Buyer Losses upon becoming aware of any event
giving rise thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, any costs of Buyer or a Buyer
Indemnitee incurred in connection with any mitigation undertaken pursuant to
this _Section 8.2.7_ shall be deemed "Buyer Losses."

 



 

8.2.8. For purposes of determining the existence of any breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement (or any representation or
warranty set forth in any certificate provided pursuant to this Agreement), or
calculating the amount of any Buyer Losses incurred in connection therewith,
any and all references to "material," "materially," or "Material Adverse
Effect" (or other correlative terms) shall be disregarded.

 



 

8.3 **_Indemnification of Seller Indemnitees_**. Subject to the limitations
contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company (prior to Closing), the Sellers and the Holder Representative, and
each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
representatives, stockholders, successors, assigns and Affiliates
(collectively, " **Seller Indemnitees** ") from and against any and all Losses
incurred by them in connection with, caused by or resulting or arising out of
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement or the certificate provided pursuant to
_Section 6.1.6_, or any failure of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation (but in the case of the Surviving Corporation, only with respect
to covenants, obligations or other agreements to be performed following
Closing) to perform any covenant, obligation or other agreement of Buyer,
Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation contained in this Agreement and the
costs of enforcing any Seller IndemniteesÂ’ rights hereunder (collectively "
**Seller Losses** ").

 



 

8.4 **_Notice and Determination of Claims_**.

 



 

8.4.1. Each claim for indemnification for any Losses may only be asserted on
or prior to the applicable Survival Termination Date; _provided_ , that as to
any Losses for which a Claim Notice has been given in accordance with the
requirements of this _Article VIII_ on or prior to the applicable Survival
Termination Date, the indemnification obligation hereunder shall continue
until the liability to be satisfied, if any, shall have been determined and
paid pursuant to this _Article VIII_.

 



 

8.4.2. If any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee wishes to make a claim for
indemnification under this _Article VIII_, such Person (individually or
collectively, the " **Claiming Party** ") shall deliver a notice describing in
reasonable detail the Loss and the method of computation of such Loss, and
containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such Loss has occurred, (a " **Claim Notice** ") to the Holder Representative
(in the case of a Claim Notice delivered by any Buyer Indemnitee) or to Buyer
(in the case of a Claim Notice delivered by any Seller Indemnitee), as
applicable (the Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, the " **Indemnifying Party**
") as promptly as possible after becoming aware of such claim, and shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with the facts giving rise to such claim for
indemnification hereunder and any other information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, in each case only to the extent
permitted by Law and then available or

 



      
 

 



 

known. The failure to promptly deliver a Claim Notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this _Article VIII _except, and
then only to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure. The Claiming Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the Claiming Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance
and cooperation shall include providing, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice and without undue interruption to the Claiming PartyÂ’s
business or personnel, reasonable access to and copies of information, records
and documents relating to such matters, in each case to the extent permitted
by Law, order and contractual obligations, and reasonable access to the
Claiming PartyÂ’s personnel.

 



 

8.4.3. For the avoidance of doubt, in each case where the Claiming Party or
the Indemnifying Party is one or more of the Sellers, all references to such
Claiming Party or Indemnifying Party in this _Article VIII _(except for
provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any
payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Holder Representative acting on
behalf of such Claiming Party or Indemnifying Party.

 



 

8.4.4. At the time of delivery of any Claim Notice with respect to Buyer
Losses for which a claim for distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Account
could be made, (a) a duplicate copy of such Claim Notice shall be delivered by
the Claiming Party to the Escrow Agent, and (b) if the Claiming Party is not
Buyer, the Claim Notice must be accompanied by a certificate from Buyer
confirming that the Claiming Party is a Buyer Indemnitee.

 



 

8.4.5. Until the thirtieth (30th) day following delivery of a Claim Notice, a
written, good faith objection (an " **Objection** ") to the claim made in such
Claim Notice may be delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Claiming Party.
At the time of delivery of any Objection to a Buyer Indemnitee with respect to
Buyer Losses for which a claim for distribution from the Indemnity Escrow
Account could be made, a duplicate copy of such Objection shall be delivered
by the Indemnifying Party to the Escrow Agent.

 



 

8.4.6. With respect to Buyer Losses, if the Holder Representative elects not
to or otherwise fails to deliver an Objection in accordance with _Section
8.4.5_ within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to
indemnification for a specified amount of Buyer Losses, such claim specified
in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Sellers
and the Holder Representative shall, to the extent applicable, together with
Buyer, execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer, for its account or for the
account of each Buyer Indemnitee named in such Claim Notice, an amount from
the Indemnity Escrow Account equal to the portion, if any, of Buyer Losses to
be distributed from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with this
_Article VIII_.

 



 

8.4.7. With respect to Seller Losses, if Buyer elects not to or otherwise
fails to deliver an Objection in accordance with _Section 8.4.5_ within
thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to
indemnification for a specified amount of Seller Losses, such claim specified
in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of Buyer and
Buyer or its designee shall deliver to the Payment Agent for further
distribution to each Seller Indemnitee named in such Claim Notice, an amount
equal to the specified amount of Seller Losses.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amount payable under this
_Section 8.4.7_ that is taxable as compensation shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation for distribution in accordance with _Section 2.6.2(d)_.

 



 

8.4.8. With respect to Buyer Losses for which a claim for distribution from
the Indemnity Escrow Account has been made, upon receipt of an Objection
properly made by the Holder Representative, (a) the Holder Representative and
Buyer shall execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer, for its account or for
the account of each applicable Buyer Indemnitee, funds in the Indemnity Escrow
Account equal to that portion of the amount subject to such Claim Notice, if
any, which is not disputed, and which is authorized for payment, by the Holder
Representative and (b) designate and segregate out such portion of the funds
in the Indemnity Escrow Account equal to the amount subject to such Claim
Notice that is disputed by the Holder Representative. Thereafter, the Escrow
Agent shall not dispose of such segregated funds from the Indemnity Escrow
Account until the Escrow Agent shall have received a copy of the final,
nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction as contemplated by
_Section 8.5.1_ hereof or the Escrow Agent shall have received a copy of a
written agreement between the Claiming Party and the Holder Representative
resolving such dispute in whole or in part and setting forth the amount, if
any, which the Holder Representative authorizes the Escrow Agent to deliver.
The Escrow Agent will deliver to Buyer, for its account or for the account of
each Buyer Indemnitee entitled to payment, funds in the Indemnity Escrow
Account equal to the amount that the Claiming Party is entitled to receive as

written authorization promptly after the Escrow AgentÂ’s receipt of such
decision or authorization, as applicable.

 



 

8.4.9. In no event shall the Escrow Agent deliver any amount out of the
Indemnity Escrow Account absent either a final, nonappealable decision or the
written authorization of the Holder Representative and Buyer.

 



 

8.5 **_Resolution of Conflicts_**.

shall deliver a written response to the Indemnifying Party. If following
delivery of such response there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt in good faith for
thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with _Section
10.13_.

 



 

8.5.2. With respect to Buyer Losses for which a claim for distribution from
the Indemnity Escrow Account has been made, if the Claiming Party and the
Indemnifying Party should at any time agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to any claims, the Holder Representative and Buyer shall
execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer, for its account or for the
account of each applicable Buyer Indemnitee, an agreed-upon amount of funds
from the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 



      
 

 



 

8.6 **_Third Person Claims_**.

 



 

8.6.1. If the Claiming Party seeks indemnification under this _Article VIII_
with respect to any pending or threatened action at law or suit in equity by a
third Person against such Claiming Party (each such action being a " **Third
Person Claim** "), the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, if (a) the Third
Person Claim involves solely monetary damages and the Indemnifying Party
expressly agrees in writing with the Claiming Party that, as between the two,
the Indemnifying Party is solely responsible to satisfy and discharge the
Third Person Claim and (b) the Indemnifying Party so elects by written notice
delivered to the Claiming Party no later than thirty (30) days after receiving
the Claim Notice, to conduct and control the defense of such Third Person
Claim with counsel chosen by it that is reasonably acceptable to the Claiming
Party, and in any such case the Claiming Party shall cooperate in connection
therewith and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may
be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith;
_provided_ , that the Claiming Party may participate in, through counsel
chosen by it and at its own expense, the defense of any such Third Person
Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has elected to conduct and control
the defense thereof; _provided further_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the Claiming Party, if and to the extent that (w) the Indemnifying Party
has not employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party to
assume the defense of such Third Person Claim within a reasonable time after
receiving notice of the commencement of the action; (x) the employment of
counsel and the amount reimbursable therefor by the Claiming Party has been
authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party; (y) a defense available to
the Claiming Party cannot be asserted by the Indemnifying Party; or (z)
representation of the Indemnifying Party and the Claiming Party by the same
counsel would, in the reasonable opinion of such counsel, create a conflict of
interest. Until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Person
Claim, the Claiming Party shall have the right to defend such Third Person
Claim, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of
such Third Person Claim subject to this _Section 8.6.1_.

 



 

8.6.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the
Indemnifying Party nor the Claiming Party shall admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise, discharge or consent to the entry of
judgment with respect to, any Third Person Claim without the prior written
consent of the Claiming Party or the Indemnifying Party, respectively (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may enter into any settlement or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Person Claim
if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) does not involve a finding or
admission of wrongdoing by the Claiming Party, (ii) includes an unconditional
written release by the applicable claimant or plaintiff of the Claiming Party
from all liability in respect of such Third Person Claim, (iii) imposes no
equitable remedies, or otherwise purports to limit, the Claiming Party and
(iv) does not subject the Claiming Party to any Losses not fully indemnified
by the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

 



 

8.7 **_Damages_**. Any Losses recoverable under this _Article VIII_ shall be
subject to the provisions of Exhibit H hereto.

 



      
 

 



 

8.8 **_Exclusive Remedy_**. Except for fraud, any remedies provided by
_Section 9.3_, _Section 10.7_, claims pursuant to _Section 2.8.2_, or
claims arising under the Transmittal Documents, if the Closing occurs, this
_Article VIII_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer
Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees for monetary damages with respect to this
Agreement or otherwise arising out of, concerning or relating, directly or
indirectly, to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

8.9 **_Subrogation_**. Each Claiming Party hereby waives any subrogation
rights that its insurers may have with respect to any Losses recoverable under
this Article VIII except to the extent such a waiver violates or would violate
the terms of any insurance policy or other contract to which any Claiming
Party is insured or is bound. To the extent that the Sellers make
indemnification payments to the Buyer Indemnitees in respect of _Section
8.2.1(i)_, the Sellers shall be subrogated to any rights and remedies that the
Surviving Corporation may have against the Litigation Trust in accordance with
the terms of the documents governing the Litigation Trust with respect to such
indemnification.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX** ** _ 
HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE_**

 



 

9.1 **_Holder Representative_**. By voting in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, approving the principal terms of the Merger, executing and
delivering their respective Transmittal Documents, or participating in the
Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive the
consideration payable in connection with the Merger, each Seller shall be
deemed to have approved the designation of, and hereby designates and
ratifies, KHR Physio, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the
representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of each Seller (the " **Holder
Representative** ") under the terms of this Agreement. The Holder
Representative shall have the right to resign, or may be removed or replaced,
on thirty (30) days advance notice to the Company, Buyer and the Escrow Agent;
_provided_ , that the Holder Representative may not be removed or replaced
unless Sellers representing at least a majority of the Pro Rata Portions
consent in writing to such removal or replacement and the identity of the
substituted representative. A vacancy in the position of Holder Representative
may be filled by written consent of Sellers representing at least a majority
of the Pro Rata Portions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
10.5_ or in this _Section 9.1_, the Holder Representative may not assign this
Agreement other than to an Affiliate of such Holder Representative.

 



 

9.2 **_Authority and Rights_**. The Holder Representative shall have full
power, authority and discretion to represent all of the Sellers and their
successors with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and any agreements ancillary to the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Holder Representative shall have no obligation to act on
behalf of or as a fiduciary of the Sellers, except as expressly provided
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder
Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion to (i) execute
and deliver the Escrow Agreement on behalf of and in the name of each such
Seller and amendments to this Agreement, (ii) authorize the release or
delivery of funds held in the Indemnity Escrow Account or Adjustment Escrow
Account as provided in _Section 2.8.2_ or _Article VIII_, (iii) hold the
Holder Expense Fund and withdraw funds from the Holder Expense Fund as

waivers and consents in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby as the Holder Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem
necessary or desirable, (vii) refrain from enforcing any right of the Sellers
or any of them or the Holder Representative arising out of or under or in any
manner relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing, (viii)
take any and all other actions specified in or contemplated by this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement and (ix) take all actions desirable in the judgment of
the Holder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or in
connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Holder
Representative may take any and all actions that it believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of
the Sellers, as fully as if such Sellers were acting on their own behalf. All
actions taken by the Holder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement shall be binding upon all Sellers and their successors as if
expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative shall have full
power and authority to interpret all terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, and any agreements ancillary to the foregoing, and
to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of the Sellers and
their successors, except as otherwise provided in _Section 10.2_. Buyer,
Merger Sub and the Company are, and shall be, entitled to conclusively rely on
(x) the appointment and treat the Holder Representative as the duly appointed
representative of the Sellers and (y) any action taken, or omitted to be
taken, by the Holder Representative or decision of the Holder Representative
in its capacity as such pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document (each, an " **Authorized Action** ") as if such action
were taken, or omitted to be taken, or decision made by the Sellers
themselves, so that they will be legally bound thereby. Each of the Sellers
agrees not to institute any claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding
against any Buyer Indemnitee alleging that the Holder Representative did not
have the authority to act as the Holder Representative on behalf of the
Sellers in connection with any Authorized Action.

 



 

9.3 **_Limitations on Liability; Expenses_**. The Holder Representative
(solely in its capacity as the Holder Representative and not as a Seller) will
incur no liability of any kind to the Sellers with respect to any action or
omission by the Holder Representative in connection with the Holder
RepresentativeÂ’s services pursuant to this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the Holder
RepresentativeÂ’s willful misconduct. Except as set forth in the foregoing
sentence, the Holder Representative shall have no liability to any other
Person (including Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates) hereunder or in any Transaction Document, with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder
Representative; _provided_ that (a) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of the Holder RepresentativeÂ’s
obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and (b) this
sentence shall not affect any Buyer IndemniteeÂ’s right to indemnification
pursuant to the terms of _Article VIII_. The Holder Representative shall at
all times be entitled to rely on any directions received via written
instruction of Sellers representing at least a majority of the Pro Rata
Portions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall not be
required to follow any such direction. The Holder Representative shall be
entitled to

 



       
 

 



 

engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem
necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function
hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such Persons. The Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Holder Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " **Representative Losses** ") arising out of or in connection
with the Holder RepresentativeÂ’s execution and performance of this Agreement
and the agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
willful misconduct of the Holder Representative, the Holder Representative
shall reimburse the Sellers the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
to the extent attributable to such willful misconduct. If not paid directly to
the Holder Representative by the Sellers, any such Representative Losses may
be recovered by the Holder Representative from (i) the Escrow Amount (but only
at such time as amounts remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account or
Indemnity Escrow Account would otherwise be distributable to the Sellers), and
(ii) the Holder Expense Fund; _provided_ , that while this section allows the
Holder Representative to be paid from the Holder Expense Fund and the Escrow
Amount, this does not relieve the Sellers from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Holder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Holder Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Sellers or otherwise. The Sellers
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Holder Representative or the termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

9.4 **_Authority_**. The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller or the assignment or succession of the
Holder Representative in accordance with the terms hereof; and (ii) shall
survive the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

9.5 **_Representations_**. The Holder Representative represents and warrants
to Buyer and Merger Sub as of the date hereof and of the Closing Date as
follows: (i) the Holder Representative is a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware
and has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its respective obligations hereunder, (ii) the
execution, delivery and performance by the Holder Representative of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly authorized by the Holder Representative and no other act
or proceeding on the part of Holder Representative, its equity holders is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Holder
Representative and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Holder
Representative, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by the Laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy and insolvency and the relief of debtors and to rules of Law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies
and (iv) except as would not materially impair the ability of the Holder
Representative to perform its obligations hereunder, the Holder Representative
is not subject to nor obligated under its organizational documents, or any

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law or contract, which would be breached or violated by its
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.2 **_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties only by
execution of an instrument in writing signed by Buyer, the Company and the
Holder Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section 10.2_, none of _Section 5.14_, _Section 7.2_, _Section
10.4_, _Section 10.7_, _Section 10.8_, _Section 10.13.1_, _Section
10.13.2_ and this _Section 10.2_ may be amended in a manner adverse to the
Debt Financing Sources and the Financing Source Related Parties without the
prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

10.3 **_Extension; Waiver_**. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer on the
one hand, and the Company and the Holder Representative, on the other hand,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations of the other Party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the

 



      
 

 



 

agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
Party. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise or to delay in
exercising any right hereunder shall be deemed a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise preclude any further or other exercise of such or
any other right.

 



 

10.4 **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement, the Exhibits, the Disclosure
Schedule, the Escrow Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the other
documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties referenced
herein constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to give any rights to any Person or entity other than (a) the
Parties and their successors and permitted assigns, (b) the former and present
managers, directors and officers as set forth in _Section 5.8_, (c) the Buyer
Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees under _Article VIII_, (d) the Buyer
Related Parties under _Section 7.2_ and (e) the Debt Financing Sources and
the Financing Source Related Parties under _Section 5.14_, _Section 7.2_,
_Section 10.2_, _Section 10.7_, _Section 10.8_, _Section 10.13.1_,
_Section 10.13.2_ and this _Section 10.4_ and the Debt Financing Sources and
Financing Source Related Parties shall be intended third party beneficiaries
of such provisions. In the event any provision of any other Transaction
Document shall in any way conflict with the provisions of this Agreement
(except where a provision therein expressly provides that it is intended to
take precedence over this Agreement), this Agreement shall control.

 



 

10.5 **_Assignment_**. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations
hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the written consent of Buyer,
the Company and the Holder Representative; _provided_ that (a) Buyer or Merger
Sub may assign (without relieving it of its obligations under) this Agreement
in whole or in part to any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates or to any Person
which becomes a successor in interest (by purchase of assets or stock, or by
merger or otherwise) to Buyer or Merger Sub, as applicable, and (ii) Buyer or
any such assignee or successor in interest may collaterally assign its rights
(but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any lender providing
financing to Buyer or any such assignee or successor in interest. Any
assignment in violation of this _Section 10.5_ shall be void. Subject to the
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

 



 

10.6 **_Severability_**. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect so long as the economic and
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

10.7 **_Equitable Remedies; Cumulative Remedies_**. The Parties acknowledge
that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate a Party for a breach of
this Agreement by any other Party. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled
to seek equitable relief, including the remedy of specific performance, in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by any other Party. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a

 



      
 

 



 

Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a
Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of (a) BuyerÂ’s obligations under
Section 5.14, and (b) BuyerÂ’s obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the
Closing) only in the event that (i) the date the Closing should have been
consummated pursuant to _Section 2.12.3_ has passed and all of the conditions
set forth in _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived as of the date the
Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
(except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions assuming
a Closing would occur), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to
Buyer in writing that (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_
have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at Closing that could have been satisfied or would
have been waived assuming a Closing would occur), (B) if Buyer performs its
obligations hereunder and the Debt Financing is funded then the Company stands
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (C) if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the Closing will
occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing (or anything to the contrary in this
Agreement), in no event shall the Company, the Holder Representative or any
Seller be entitled to, or be permitted to seek, specific performance directly
against any Debt Financing Source.

 



 

10.8 **_Governing Law_**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 



 

10.9 **_Interpretation_**. The words (i) "include," "includes" and "including"
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation," (ii) "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and (iii) unless the context
otherwise requires, the word "or" shall be inclusive and not exclusive. Except
as otherwise expressly indicated, an item shall be considered "made available"
to a Party hereto, to the extent such phrase appears in this Agreement, only
if such item has been provided in writing (including via electronic mail) to
such Party or posted by the Company or its representatives in the Data Room at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the date hereof. Throughout this
Agreement, as the context may require, the singular tense and number includes
the plural, and the plural tense and number includes the singular. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified, references to dollar amounts
herein are to U.S. dollars. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
herein: (a) to Articles, Sections, Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, and
Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure Schedule, Schedules
and Exhibits to this Agreement; (b) to an agreement, instrument or other
document means such agreement, instrument or other document as amended,
supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent permitted by the
provisions thereof and (c) to a statute means such statute as amended from
time to time prior to the date of this Agreement and includes any successor
legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder prior to the
date of this Agreement. References to the "Company" and the "Company
Subsidiaries" in _Article III_ hereof shall be deemed to include their
respective predecessors. The Disclosure Schedule, Exhibits and Schedules
referred to herein shall be

 



      
 

 



 

construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent
as if they were set forth verbatim herein. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

10.10 **_Disclosure Schedule_**. The inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedule shall not imply any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking
not expressly given in this Agreement nor shall such disclosure be taken as
extending the scope of any of the representations, warranties or covenants in
this Agreement. The inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall
not (a) constitute a determination that such matter is material to the
business, assets, results of operations or affairs of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries or be deemed to establish a standard of materiality,
(b) constitute a determination that such matter arose outside the ordinary
course of business or (c) constitute an admission of liability or obligation
to any third Person. Disclosure under any section of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed disclosure as to each section of this Agreement to which the
relevance of such disclosed item is reasonably apparent on its face. Any
description or brief summary of an instrument or other document contained in
the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to refer to the entire instrument or
document (but not any amendments or supplements thereto), which instrument or
document shall be deemed incorporated therein by such reference.

 



 

10.11 **_Rules of Construction_**. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 



 

10.12 **_Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_**. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the others (including via
facsimile or email), it being understood that all Parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

 



 

10.13 **_Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_**.

 



 

10.13.1. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other
party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in any
Delaware state or federal court, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and
with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to
any such action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Parties agrees not to
commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts
described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the Parties further agrees that
notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and
the Parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not
to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action

 



      
 

 



 

or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section 10.13.1_,
with respect to any claim of any kind or description (whether in law or in
equity and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) involving any Debt
Financing Source arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance of services thereunder, the parties agree that (i) such claims
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court therefrom, (ii)
they shall not bring or permit any of their respective Affiliates to bring any
claim referred to in this last sentence of this _Section 10.13.1_ or
voluntarily support any other Person in bringing any such claim, in any other
courts, (iii) they each shall waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have that any such claim has been
brought in an inconvenient forum and (iv) the provisions of this last sentence
of this _Section 10.13.1_ shall be given effect in connection with any such
claims.

 



 

10.13.2. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING (INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM) ARISING
OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT
OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE
OF ACTION IN RESPECT OF ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE).

 



 

10.14 **_Waiver and Release_**. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, for
itself and all of its Affiliates (collectively, the " **Releasors** "), to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hereby releases and forever
discharges Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Subsidiaries (individually, a " **Releasee** " and collectively, "
**Releasees** ") from any and all Losses by reason of, relating to or arising
from the fact that such Seller was a stockholder or optionholder of the
Company, and which such Seller or its Affiliates now has, has ever had or may
hereafter have against the respective Releasees arising prior to the Closing
whether or not relating to claims pending at, or asserted after, the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall operate to
release any of such SellerÂ’s rights (a) under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or (b) under any written employment or severance
agreement or any agreement set forth in _Schedule 5.8_.
