 Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of capital stock of Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Company: 

  

  

 (a) _ Conversion of Company Common Stock._ 

    

 (i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Shares, with respect to which an election to receive only cash (a "Cash Election") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.4 (each, a "Cash Electing Company Share") shall be converted into the right to receive Twenty-Six Dollars and Seventy-Five Cents ($26.75), subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(g) (the "Per Share Value"), without interest; _provided, however_ , that if: (x) the sum of (A) the product of the number of Cash Electing Company Shares and the Per Share Value and (B) the product of the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares and the Mixed Election Cash Consideration (such sum being the "Cash Election Amount") exceeds (y) an amount equal to the Per Share Value, _multiplied by_ 0.35, _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares (the "Available Cash"), then each Cash Electing Company Share shall instead be converted into the right to receive (I) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent) determined by dividing (X) an amount equal to the Available Cash _minus_ the product of the Mixed Election Cash Consideration and the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares, by (Y) the number of Cash Electing Company Shares (such fraction being the "Pro-Rated Cash Amount") and (II) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) of (X) the Exchange Ratio and (Y) one (1) _minus_ the quotient obtained by dividing the Pro-Rated Cash Amount by the Per Share Value; 

  

 (ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Shares, with respect to which an election to receive only Acquiror Common Stock (a "Share Election") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.4 (each, a "Share Electing Company Share") shall be converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to: (x) the Per Share Value; _divided by_  (y) Thirty-Five Dollars and Eighteen Cents ($35.18), rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share (the "Exchange Ratio"); _provided, however_ , that if: (A) the sum of (I) the product of the number of Share Electing Company Shares and the Exchange Ratio and (II) the product of the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares and the Mixed Election Share Consideration (such sum being the "Share Election Amount") exceeds (B) an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_ 0.65, _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares (the "Available Shares"), then each Share Electing Company Share shall instead be converted into the right to receive (X) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) determined by dividing (p) an amount equal to the number of Available Shares _minus_ the product of the Mixed Election Share Consideration and the number of Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares, by (q) the number of Share Electing Company Shares (such fraction being the "Pro-Rated Share Amount"), and (Y) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product (rounded to the nearest hundredth of a 

   

      

   

cent) of (p) the Per Share Value and (q) one (1) _minus_ the quotient
obtained by dividing the Pro-Rated Share Amount by the Exchange Ratio;

  

 (iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Shares, with respect to which an election to receive Acquiror Common Stock and cash (a "Mixed Election") has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.4 (each, a "Mixed Consideration Electing Company Share") shall be converted into the right to receive: (x) an amount in cash equal to (A) the Per Share Value, _multiplied by_ (B) 0.35, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent, without interest (the "Mixed Election Cash Consideration") and (y) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (A) the Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_ (B) 0.65, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share (the "Mixed Election Share Consideration"); and 

  

 (iv) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, with respect to which no Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election has been properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.4 (each, a "Non-Electing Company Share") shall be converted into the right to receive (x) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent) determined by dividing (A) the amount, if any, by which (I) the Available Cash exceeds (II) the aggregate amount of cash (excluding cash payable in lieu of fractional shares) payable in respect of Cash Electing Company Shares, Share Electing Company Shares and Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares (the amount of such excess, if any, the "Remaining Cash Amount"), by (B) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares, and (y) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) determined by dividing (A) the amount, if any, by which (I) the number of Available Shares exceeds (II) the aggregate number of shares (including fractional shares that would otherwise be payable in cash) deliverable in respect of Cash Electing Company Shares, Share Electing Company Shares and Mixed Consideration Electing Company Shares (the amount of such excess, if any, the "Remaining Share Amount"), by (B) the number of Non-Electing Company Shares; 

    

 _provided_ , in each case, that no fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock
shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Acquiror Common
Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) shall instead be entitled to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest whole cent,
determined by multiplying the Acquiror Share Trading Price by the fractional
share (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share) of Acquiror Common
Stock to which such former holder would otherwise be entitled. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Exchange Ratio shall be 0.7604, except to the extent
an adjustment thereto is required pursuant to Section 2.1(h) or as a result
of an adjustment to the Per Share Value pursuant to Section 2.1(g).

  

 (b) _ Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock._ Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive one (1) (the "Series B Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share (the "Series B Merger Consideration") of a newly created series of Acquiror Preferred Stock having such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions of the Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, taken as a whole (the "Acquiror Series G Preferred Stock"). 

  

      

  

 (c) _ Conversion of Series D Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Excluded Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive one (1) (the "Series D Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share (the "Series D Merger Consideration") of a newly created series of Acquiror Preferred Stock having such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders of Series D Preferred Stock than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions of the Series D Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, taken as a whole (the "Acquiror Series H Preferred Stock"). 

  

 (d) _ Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share, including any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held in the Company\'s treasury, shall be cancelled and no consideration will be issued or paid in exchange therefor. 

  

 (e) _ No Effect on Limited Liability Company Interests of Merger Sub._ The Merger shall have no effect on the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of Merger Sub, which shall remain outstanding as limited liability company interests of the Surviving Company. 

   

 (f) _ Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held by a Person (a "Dissenting Stockholder") who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of such shares to require appraisal of their Shares ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, Series B Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as applicable, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, its shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Common Stock Merger Consideration, Series B Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as applicable for each such share, without interest, subject to the terms of this Article 2. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and shall give Acquiror the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Acquiror, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. 

  

 (g) _ Adjustment of Per Share Value_. If the Adjusted Equity of the Company as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, or such other date as mutually agreeable to Acquiror and the Company (such date, the "Measurement Date"), is less than $125.9 million (the "Minimum Equity"), then the Per Share Value shall be reduced by an amount equal to (i) Twenty-Six Dollars and Seventy-Five Cents ($26.75), _multiplied by_ (ii) the amount of such shortfall, _divided by_ (iii) the Minimum Equity, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent. For purposes of this Agreement, "Adjusted Equity" means, as of any date, the total stockholders\' equity of the Company as of such date, calculated on a consolidated basis and in accordance with GAAP and adjusted to exclude: (i) any transaction expenses required to be incurred or accrued by the Company as a result of the Contemplated Transactions, including any fees payable to financial advisors, legal counsel and accountants, (ii) any accounting charges, solely to the extent taken at the written request of Acquiror subsequent to the date of this Agreement 

  

      

  

and not otherwise required to be incurred or taken pursuant to applicable
Legal Requirements, GAAP or the terms of this Agreement; and (iii) any change
in the value of the deferred tax assets, net, of the Company from the value
of the deferred tax assets, net reflected in the Company\'s audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, in each case calculated on
a consolidated basis and in accordance with GAAP, but solely to the extent
such change results from any change in federal corporate income tax rates
subsequent to December 31, 2016. On the Measurement Date, the Company shall
deliver to Acquiror a certificate, signed by the chief financial officer of
the Company, dated the Closing Date, setting forth a copy of the Company\'s
balance sheet as of the Measurement Date and a calculation of the Adjusted
Equity, which certificate and calculation shall be subject to review and
approval by Acquiror.

   

 (h) _ Adjustment of Exchange Ratios_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock or Company Capital Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio, the Series B Exchange Ratio or the Series D Exchange Ratio, as applicable, shall be adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

  

 Section 2.2 _Cancellation of Shares_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and any certificates (it being understood that any reference herein to a "certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to any book-entry account statement relating to the ownership of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock) that represented Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender thereof, the Common Stock Merger Consideration, Series B Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as applicable, the subject to the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

  

 (a) Acquiror shall designate a Person, reasonable acceptable to the Company, to serve, pursuant to the terms of an exchange agent agreement, as the exchange agent for purposes of this Agreement (the "Exchange Agent") and Acquiror shall execute and deliver an exchange agent agreement at or prior to the Effective Time. Acquiror shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall authorize the issuance of and shall make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i) the aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1, (ii) the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1, including the amount of cash payable in lieu of fractional shares; (iii) sufficient cash for payment of any dividends or distributions that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.3(c); (iv) a number of shares of Acquiror Series G Preferred Stock and Acquiror Series H Preferred Stock equal to the aggregate Series B Merger Consideration and Series D Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1; and (v) sufficient cash for the payment of the Company equity awards as required to pursuant to Section 2.5. Such amount of cash and shares of Acquiror Common Stock, Acquiror Series G Preferred Stock and Acquiror Series H Preferred Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto paid after the Effective Time, are referred to in this Article 2 as the "Exchange Fund"." 

   

 (b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to 

  

      

  

each holder of record of one or more certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock
("Company Stock Certificates") a letter of transmittal ("Letter of
Transmittal"), in a form to be agreed by the parties, which specifies, among
other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificates
to the Exchange Agent, together with instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to this Agreement.

  

 (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company. No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Acquiror Common Stock, Acquiror Series G Preferred Stock or Acquiror Series H Preferred Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate that previously represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock until the holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Promptly after the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article 2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock, Acquiror Series G Preferred Stock or Acquiror Series H Preferred Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such Company Stock Certificate were converted at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1. No holder of an unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate that previously represented shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate, to vote the shares of Acquiror Common Stock or Acquiror Preferred Stock into which such holder\'s Company Common Stock shall have been converted. 

  

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Company, or its successors in interest. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company, or its successors in interest, for issuance and payment of the Common Stock Merger Consideration (including the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares deliverable in respect of such stockholders\' shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror Common Stock), Series B Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (e) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Stock Certificate, Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, deliver to such person the Common Stock Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect of such stockholders\' shares of Company Common Stock, as well as any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions on shares of such Acquiror Common Stock), Series B Merger Consideration or Series D Merger Consideration, as applicable, into which the shares represented by such lost Company Stock Certificate shall have been converted, subject to the terms of and in accordance with this Article 2. 

  

      

                                    

    

 Section 2.4 _Election Procedures_. 

  

  

 (a) Each person who, on or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock other than Excluded Shares shall be entitled to specify the number of such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election, a Share Election or a Mixed Election. 

  

 (b) Acquiror shall prepare a form of election (the "Form of Election") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Form of Election shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Form of Election and any Company Stock Certificates in accordance with Section 2.3. The Company shall mail the Form of Election on a date to be mutually agreed by Acquiror and the Company that is not more than forty-five (45), nor less than thirty (30) days, prior to the anticipated Closing Date or such other date as Acquiror and the Company shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to all persons who are record holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date"). The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation) to make a Cash Election, a Share Election or a Mixed Election. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election available as may be reasonably requested from time to time by all persons who become record holders of shares of Company Common Stock during the period between the Election Form Record Date and the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for Acquiror and the Exchange Agent to perform as specified herein. 

  

 (c) Any holder\'s election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., local time, on the twenty-fifth (25th) day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as Acquiror and the Company may agree) (the "Election Deadline"), a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by: (i) Company Stock Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Company Certificates as set forth in such Form of Election from a firm that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such Company Stock Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time set forth in such guarantee of delivery);or (ii) in the case of book-entry shares, any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election, a Share Election or a Mixed Election is properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, no further registration of transfers of such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until such Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election is properly revoked. 

  

 (d) Acquiror and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline may, upon mutual agreement of Acquiror and the Company, be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Acquiror and the Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline. 

   

 (e) Any Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election may be revoked with respect to all or a portion of the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto by the holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Cash Elections, Share Elections and Mixed Elections 

  

      

  

shall automatically be revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms. If a Cash Election, Share Election or Mixed Election is
revoked, the shares as to which such election previously applied shall be
treated as Non-Electing Company Shares unless a contrary election is properly
made by the holder within the period during which elections are permitted to
be made pursuant to Section 2.4(c). Company Stock Certificates will not be
returned to holders in the event an election is revoked unless the holder so
requests.

  

 (f) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Form of Election, the reasonable, good-faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of Acquiror and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not Cash Elections, Mixed Elections and Share Elections shall have been properly made or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.4 (and to disregard any immaterial defects in the Forms of Election) and as to when Cash Elections, Mixed Elections, Share Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or Acquiror and the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make the following computation) shall also make all computations contemplated by Section 2.1(a), and absent manifest error this computation shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement of Acquiror (subject to the consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld), make any rules as are consistent with this Section 2.4 for the implementation of the Cash Elections, Mixed Elections and Share Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be necessary or desirable to effect these Cash Elections, Mixed Elections and Share Elections. None of Acquiror, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election. 

  

  

 Section 2.5 _Company Equity Awards_. 

  

  

 (a) _ Company Stock Options._ The Company shall take all necessary actions so that, at the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by the Company in consideration for which the holder thereof shall thereupon be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time a cash payment in respect of such cancellation from the Company in an amount, without interest, equal to: (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Value over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; _minus_  (ii) all applicable federal, state and local Taxes required to be withheld by the Surviving Company. In connection with the cash out of the Company Stock Option, the Company shall require the holder of such options to execute a stock option cancellation agreement prior to payment of such consideration.

The Company SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Company SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

As of December 31, 2016, to the Knowledge of the Company, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance.

Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

No Company Benefit Plan provides for payment of any amount which, considered in the aggregate with amounts payable pursuant to all other Company Benefit Plans, would result in any amount being non-deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

plan pursuant to which a stop loss policy or contract applies). With respect
to any Company Benefit Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" (as described
in Section 413(c) of the Code) or is provided by or through a professional
employer organization, such Company Benefit Plan complies in all respects with
the requirements of the Code and ERISA and neither the Company nor any of
the Company ERISA Affiliates has any liabilities other than the payment
and/or remittance of premiums and/or required contributions on behalf of
enrolled individuals. Neither the Company nor any of the Company ERISA
Affiliates sponsors, maintains, administers or contributes to, or has ever
sponsored, maintained, administered or contributed to, or has, has had or
could have any liability with respect to, any Company Benefit Plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or any
tax-qualified "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA).
No Company Benefit Plan is underfunded when comparing the present value of
accrued liabilities under such plan to the market value of plan assets.

   

 (d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401 and related provisions of the Code is the subject of a favorable determination letter, or, in the case of a volume submitter or prototype plan, an advisory or sponsor letter, from the IRS to the effect that it is so qualified under the Code and that its related funding instrument is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code (or the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise relying on an opinion letter issued to the prototype sponsor), and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would adversely affect the qualified status of any Company Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of any related trust. 

   

 (e) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been administered in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (f) Other than routine claims for benefits made in the Ordinary Course of Business, there is no litigation, claim or assessment pending or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened by, on behalf of, or against any Company Benefit Plan or against the administrators or trustees or other fiduciaries of any Company Benefit Plan that alleges a violation of applicable state or federal law or violation of any Company Benefit Plan document or related agreement. 

   

 (g) No Company Benefit Plan fiduciary or any other person has, or has had, any liability to any Company Benefit Plan participant, beneficiary or any other person under any provisions of ERISA or any other applicable Legal Requirement by reason of any action or failure to act in connection with any Company Benefit Plan, including any liability by any reason of any payment of, or failure to pay, benefits or any other amounts or by reason of any credit or failure to give credit for any benefits or rights.

 (j) No condition exists as a result of which the Company or any Subsidiary would have any liability, whether absolute or contingent, under any Company Benefit Plan with respect to any misclassification of a person performing services for the Company or any Subsidiary as an 

  

      

  

independent contractor rather than as an employee. All individuals
participating in Company Benefit Plans are in fact eligible and authorized to
participate in such Company Benefit Plan.

The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company has complied in all material respects with all Environmental Laws applicable to it and its business operations.

 Section 3.25 _Approval Delays_. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason why the granting of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals would be denied or unduly delayed. The Company Bank\'s most recent CRA rating was "satisfactory" or better.

The Company and each Subsidiary has good and marketable title to all Company Investment Securities held by it, free and clear of any liens, mortgages, security interests, encumbrances or charges, except for Company Permitted Exceptions and except to the extent such Company Investment Securities are pledged in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with prudent banking practices to secure obligations of the Company or the Company Bank. The Company Investment Securities are valued on the books of the Company and the Company Bank in accordance with GAAP. 

  

 (b) Except as may be imposed by applicable securities laws and restrictions that may exist for securities that are classified as "held to maturity," none of the Company Investment Securities is 

  

      

  

subject to any restriction, whether contractual or statutory, that materially
impairs the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of
such investment at any time. With respect to all material repurchase

Company or such Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, has a valid,

collateral securing each such repurchase agreement, and the value of the

All of such Derivative Transactions are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of equity), and are in full force and effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have duly performed their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 Section 4.7 _Acquiror SEC Reports; Financial Statements and Reports; Regulatory Filings_. 

  

  

 (a) Acquiror has timely filed all Acquiror SEC Reports, except where the failure to file any Acquiror SEC Report, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror, and all such Acquiror SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects, as of their respective filing dates and effective dates, as the case may be, with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. The Acquiror SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements in all material respects. As of their respective filing dates, none of the Acquiror SEC Reports contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Acquiror SEC Reports. No Subsidiary of Acquiror is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

   

 (b) The financial statements presented (or incorporated by reference) in the Acquiror SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, except in each case as indicated in such statements or the notes thereto, and comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. Taken together, the financial statements presented in the Acquiror SEC Reports (collectively, the "Acquiror Financial Statements") are complete and correct in all material respects and fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in the Acquiror Financial Statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of unaudited Acquiror Financial Statements. The Acquiror Financial Statements do not include any assets or omit to state any liabilities, absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render the Acquiror Financial Statements misleading in any material respect as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein. As of the date hereof, KPMG LLP has not resigned (or informed Acquiror that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent registered public accountants of Acquiror. 

  

 (c) Acquiror is in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to it or any of its Subsidiaries. Acquiror maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Acquiror in reports that Acquiror is required to file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Acquiror\'s management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of December 31, 2016, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, such controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to provide such reasonable assurance. 

  

 (d) Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Acquiror\'s certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Acquiror under the Exchange 

  

      

  

Act (the "Acquiror Evaluation Date"). Acquiror presented in such quarterly
report the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness
of Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting based on their
evaluations as of the Acquiror Evaluation Date. Since the Acquiror Evaluation
Date, there have been no changes in Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Acquiror\'s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Acquiror has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management\'s general or specific authorization;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management\'s
general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

   

 (e) Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed since January 1, 2015, with all applicable federal or state securities or banking authorities except to the extent failure would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror and its Subsidiaries. Such forms, reports and documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements; and (ii) did not at the time they were filed, after giving effect to any amendment thereto filed prior to the date hereof, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) is deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. 

  

 (f) To the Knowledge of Acquiror, there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2015 that would result in a determination that Acquiror Bank is not an eligible depository institution as defined in 12 C.F.R. §303.2(r). 

  

 (g) Acquiror\'s securities are not listed, or quoted, for trading on any U.S. domestic or foreign securities exchange, other than the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Acquiror satisfies all of the quantitative maintenance criteria of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 

  

  

 Section 4.8 _Books and Records_. The books of account, minute books, stock record books and other records of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries are complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in accordance with Acquiror\'s business practices and all applicable Legal Requirements, including the maintenance of an adequate system of internal controls required by such Legal Requirements. The minute books of Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries fairly reflect the substance of events and transactions included therein. 

   

 Section 4.9 _Loans; Loan Loss Reserve_. 

  

  

 (a) Acquiror Bank\'s allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in the Acquiror Financial Statements (including footnotes thereto) was determined on the basis of Acquiror Bank\'s continuing review and evaluation of the portfolio of Acquiror Loans under the requirements of GAAP and Legal Requirements, was established in a manner consistent with Acquiror Bank\'s internal policies, and, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror Bank, was adequate in all material respects under the requirements of GAAP and all Legal Requirements to provide for possible or specific losses, net of recoveries relating to Acquiror Loans previously charged-off, on outstanding Acquiror Loans. 

  

 (b) To the Knowledge of Acquiror: (i) none of the Acquiror Loans is subject to any material offset or claim of offset; and (ii) the aggregate loan balances in excess of Acquiror Bank\'s allowance for loan and lease losses are, based on past loan loss experience, collectible in

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

amendment: (a) alters or changes the amount or kind of the Common
Stock Merger Consideration, Series B Merger Consideration or Series D Merger
Consideration; (b) adversely affects the Tax treatment of the Merger with
respect to the Company\'s stockholders; (c) is reasonably likely to cause the
Closing to be delayed or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals to
be prevented or delayed, in each case beyond the Termination Date; or (d)
requires submission to or approval of the Company\'s stockholders after the
Merger has been approved by the Company\'s stockholders.

Following the Closing, Acquiror shall maintain employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of Covered Employees that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly-situated employees of Acquiror under the Acquiror Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen Acquiror Benefit Plan; and (ii) until such time as Acquiror shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Acquiror Benefit Plans, a Covered Employee\'s continued participation in Company Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the Acquiror Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each Acquiror Benefit Plan). 

  

 (b) For the purpose of satisfying eligibility requirements and vesting periods (but not for the purpose of benefit accruals) under the Acquiror Benefit Plans providing benefits to the Covered Employees (the "New Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. 

  

 (c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Transition Date, Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) each Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is similar in type to an applicable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was participating immediately prior to the Transition Date (such Company Benefit Plans prior to the Transition Date collectively, the "Old 

  

      

  

Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision or similar benefits to any Covered Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan shall be waived for such Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old
Plan in which such Covered Employee, as applicable, participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Transition Date; and (iii)
any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending
on the Transition Date shall be taken into account under such New Plan to the
extent such eligible expenses were incurred during the plan year of the New
Plan in which the Transition Date occurs for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Covered Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

 (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Company\'s severance policies immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.8, following the Effective Time, Acquiror or Acquiror\'s Subsidiary will cause any eligible Company employee (exempt and non-exempt) to be covered by a severance policy under which employees who incur a qualifying involuntary termination of employment will be eligible to receive severance pay in accordance with the severance pay schedule set forth on Schedule 7.8(d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Company employee eligible to receive severance benefits under an employment, change in control, severance or other agreement shall be entitled to participate in the severance policy described in this Section 7.8(d) or to otherwise receive severance benefits. Any Company employee who waives and relinquishes his or her right to a change in control payment will be eligible for a severance payment as provided in this Section 7.8(d). 

   

 (e) Any Company employee who is eligible to receive severance benefits or other payment triggered by any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any other agreement or arrangement (a "CIC Payment") shall not receive any severance benefits as provided in Section 7.8(d) but will receive the CIC Payment to the extent it is required to be paid under such agreement, provided that, on or before the Closing Date, the Company shall, with Acquiror\'s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, take all steps necessary to ensure that in the event that the amounts of the CIC Payment, either individually or in conjunction with a payment or benefit under any other plan, agreement or arrangement that is aggregated for purposes of Code Section 280G (in the aggregate "Total Payments"), would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that is subject to the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the amounts of the CIC Payment will be reduced such that the value of the Total Payments that each counterparty is entitled to receive shall be $1.00 less than the maximum amount which the counterparty may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax or resulting in a disallowance of a deduction of the payment of such amount under Section 280G of the Code. 

  

  

 Section 7.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties will each take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (a) any disposition of shares of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions of Acquiror Common Stock from Acquiror by virtue of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who will become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Acquiror immediately following the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

   

 Section 7.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall give the other the reasonable opportunity to consult concerning the defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company or Acquiror, as applicable, or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the Contemplated Transactions.

 (c) by Acquiror or the Company if: (i) any Regulatory Authority that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of any of the Contemplated Transactions and such denial has become final and nonappealable; (ii) any application, filing or notice for a Requisite Regulatory Approval has been withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the applicable Regulatory Authority and with the consent of Acquiror and the Company; (iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting; or (iv) if the Acquiror Shareholder Approval is not obtained at the Acquiror Shareholders\' Meeting; _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(c) shall not be available to a party whose failure (or the failure of any of its Affiliates) to fulfill any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the occurrence of any event described in clauses (i) and (ii) above; 

  

 (d) by Acquiror or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to October 31, 2017 or, if the Required Regulatory Approvals have not been obtained and all related waiting periods not expired or been terminated at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such date, December 31, 2017 (the "Termination Date"); _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(d) shall not be available to any party to this Agreement whose failure to fulfill any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or prior to such date;

(y) the Initial Index Price and (B) subtracting 0.175; _subject, however_ ,
to the remainder of this Section 10.1(i). If the Company elects to exercise
its termination right pursuant to this Section 10.1(i), it shall give
written notice thereof to Acquiror within one (1) Business Day after the
Determination Date. Acquiror shall then have the option, exercisable by
notice to the Company on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day after
Acquiror\'s receipt of such notice, to increase the Exchange Ratio to
equal the lesser of (x) a quotient, the numerator of which is equal to the
product of (A) the Initial Acquiror Market Value, (B) the Exchange Ratio (as
then in effect), and (C) the Index Ratio _minus_ 0.175, and the denominator
of which is equal to the Final Acquiror Market Value; or (y) the quotient

Acquiror Market Value, and multiplying the quotient by the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and 0.825. If within such five (5)
Business Day period, Acquiror delivers written notice to the Company that it
intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional consideration as
contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies the Company of the
revised Exchange Ratio, then no termination shall have occurred pursuant to
this Section 10.1(i), and this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms (except that the Exchange Ratio shall have
been so modified). If Acquiror or any company belonging to the Index declares
or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of
this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of
such company shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this
Section 10.1(i).

 (f) If this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(iii) and any party to the Voting Agreement has materially breached the provisions thereof, then the Company shall pay to Acquiror, within two (2) Business Days after such termination, the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Acquiror shall designate.
