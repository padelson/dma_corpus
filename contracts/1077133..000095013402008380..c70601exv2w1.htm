 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER  

  This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this  _"Agreement"_ ), dated as of July 11, 2002, is made among Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, a Delaware corporation _("Parent"),_ ADM Milling Co., a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent  _("Parent Subsidiary"),_ ADM Acquisition LLC  _("Merger Subsidiary"),_ a Colorado limited liability company owned 98.57% by Parent and 1.43% by Parent Subsidiary, and Minnesota Corn Processors, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the _"Company")._    

 Recitals  

  The members of Merger Subsidiary and the Boards of Directors of Parent, Parent Subsidiary, and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of each company and its respective stockholders and members that Parent and Parent Subsidiary acquire all of the outstanding membership units in the Company that Parent does not currently own.   

  The acquisition of such membership interests shall be effected by the terms of this Agreement through a transaction in which Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company and the holders (the _"Class A Holders"_) of Class A units of membership interest in the Company _("Class A Units")_ will be entitled to receive cash from Parent and Parent Subsidiary in exchange for their Class A Units (the  _"Merger"_ ).   

 Agreement  

  Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:     

 ARTICLE I   

 THE MERGER   

  SECTION 1.1 _The Merger._ Upon the terms of, and subject to the conditions set forth in, this Agreement, at the Effective Time (defined in Section 1.3), Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the Colorado Limited Liability Company Act (the _"CLLCA")._ The Company shall be the surviving organization in the Merger. (The term _"Surviving Organization"_ refers to the Company in its capacity as the surviving organization in the Merger.) The address of the Surviving Organization shall be 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526. The effects and the consequences of the Merger are as set forth in Section 1.4.   

  SECTION 1.2 _Closing. _ The closing of the Merger (the _"Closing"_ ) will take place at 10:00 a.m. (Central Time) on the business day following the date on which the last of the closing conditions set forth in Article VII has been met or waived in accordance with this Agreement (other than those that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the time of the Closing), or on such other date or at such other time as may be agreed to by the parties (the date of the Closing is referred to as the  _"Closing Date")._ The Closing shall take place at the offices of Faegre and Benson LLP, 90 South Seventh Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, or at such other location as may be agreed to by the parties.   

  SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time of the Merger._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall file with the Colorado Secretary of State a duly prepared statement of merger (the _"Merger Certificate"_ ). The Merger Certificate shall be filed as soon as practicable on the Closing Date (or such other date as may be agreed to by the parties) following the Closing. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Merger Certificate with the Colorado Secretary of State in accordance with Section 7-80-1005 of the CLLCA (the date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the  _"Effective Time"_ ).    ##### 

  

  SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger._ At the Effective Time:   

  (a) Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the Surviving Organization;   

  (b) the articles of organization of the Company shall be the articles of organization of the Surviving Organization, and the Surviving Organization shall have no operating agreement;   

  (c) Parent shall own approximately 99%, and Parent Subsidiary shall own approximately 1%, of the outstanding membership interests of the Surviving Organization; and   

  (d) the Merger shall have all the other effects prescribed in the CLLCA.     

 ARTICLE II   

 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   

  SECTION 2.1 _Effects on Equity Securities._ Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Parent Subsidiary, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, or the holder of any of the following securities:   

  (a) _Company Membership Units._   

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) Each issued and outstanding Class A  unit shall be
exchanged for the right to receive from Parent and  Parent Subsidiary an
aggregate amount in cash equal to $2.90  (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 
  
      
      |   (ii) Each issued and outstanding  Class B unit of
membership interest in the Company shall  remain outstanding with no
change.    
    

  (b) _Merger Subsidiary Membership Units. _ Each issued and outstanding unit of membership interest in Merger Subsidiary shall be canceled and the capital contributions of the members thereof shall be returned.   

  (c) _No Dissenters  Rights. _Pursuant to Section 3.19 of the Companys operating agreement, the Class A Holders shall not have any dissenters or appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.   

  SECTION 2.2 _Payment for Class A Units._   

  (a) At or before the Effective Time, Parent and Parent Subsidiary shall deposit (in proportion to their membership interests in Merger Subsidiary) in immediately available funds with Hickory Point Bank and Trust, fsb, or any other disbursing agent of Parent and Parent Subsidiary that is selected by Parent and Parent Subsidiary and that is organized under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States and has capital, surplus, and undivided profits of at least $500 million (the _"Disbursing Agent"_ ), an amount equal to the product of the number of Class A Units issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration, less amounts permitted to be withheld from certain Class A Holders under Section 2.3 (the _"Fund"_ ). Out of the Fund, the Disbursing Agent shall make on behalf of Parent and Parent Subsidiary, respectively, and in proportion to their membership interests in Merger Subsidiary, the payments referred to in Section 2.1(a)(i), subject to the other provisions of this Article II. The Disbursing Agent may invest portions of the Fund as Parent and Parent Subsidiary direct, but substantially all such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements, or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital, surplus, and undivided profits exceeding $500 million (collectively,  _"Permitted Investments"_ ), or in money market funds invested solely in Permitted Investments. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent and Parent Subsidiary in proportion to their membership interests in Merger Subsidiary. Any amount remaining in the Fund one year after the Effective Time may be    ##### 

  

 refunded to Parent and Parent Subsidiary at their option, but Parent and
Parent Subsidiary shall be liable for any cash payments required to be made
thereafter under this Article II.  

  

  (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent shall mail to each Class A Holder a letter of transmittal (the _"Letter of Transmittal"_ ) and instructions for its use in effecting the surrender of certificates representing Class A Units _("Certificates")_ in exchange for cash under this Article II. The Letter of Transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to the Disbursing Agent. The Disbursing Agent, as soon as practicable following receipt of any Certificate together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and any other items as may be reasonably required to be delivered to the Disbursing Agent, as specified by the Letter of Transmittal, shall pay, by check or draft, to the person or persons entitled thereto, the amount determined by multiplying the number of Class A Units represented by the Certificate so surrendered by the Merger Consideration, less any amounts permitted to be withheld under Section 2.3. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name a Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting the payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of Parent and Parent Subsidiary that the tax has been paid or is not applicable.   

  (c) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming any such Certificate to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, the amount to which such person would have been entitled hereunder but for failure to deliver the Certificate to the Disbursing Agent shall nevertheless be paid to such person, but Parent and Parent Subsidiary may, in their sole discretion and as a condition precedent to such payment, require such person to give Parent and Parent Subsidiary a bond in such reasonable sum (the cost of which shall not exceed 1% of the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Class A Units represented by the Certificate) as Parent and Parent Subsidiary may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be had against Parent, Parent Subsidiary, or the Surviving Organization with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.   

  SECTION 2.3 _Offset of 1996 Loss Payable._ Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent, using the records of the Company, shall prepare a schedule of Class A Holders having outstanding obligations to the Company relating to the _"1996 Loss Payable"_ (defined in the Companys operating agreement) as of the Effective Time. The schedule shall set forth the aggregate amount of each such Class A Holders obligations to the Company relating to the 1996 Loss Payable. For each such Class A Holder, Parent and Parent Subsidiary shall be entitled to withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the Class A Holder hereunder an amount equal to the aggregate obligations of such holder to the Company relating to the 1996 Loss Payable divided by the number of Class A Units held by the holder (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent). Parent and Parent Subsidiary shall, or shall cause the Disbursing Agent to, mail to each such Class A Holder a statement showing the aggregate and per-unit amount of such withholding with respect to that Class A Holder.   

  SECTION 2.4 _No Further Rights._ From and after the Effective Time, each Class A Member (as defined in the Companys operating agreement) shall cease to have any rights as a Class A Member, except for the right to surrender the members Certificate in exchange for the payment provided under this Article II.     

 ARTICLE III   

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   

  Except as otherwise set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Parent Subsidiary concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the _"Company_     ##### 

  

  _Disclosure Schedule"_ ), the Company represents and warrants to Parent,
Parent Subsidiary, and Merger Subsidiary as follows:  

  

  SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing, Qualification._

Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign organization to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated, or leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except such jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified, licensed, or in good standing would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (defined below).   

  (b) Copies of the articles of organization and operating agreement (or similar organizational documents) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been provided to Parent and Parent Subsidiary and are complete and correct as of the date of this Agreement.   

  (c) _"Company Material Adverse Effect"_ means a material adverse effect upon the business, operations, results of operations, properties, assets, or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or on the Companys ability to timely consummate the Merger. "Company Material Adverse Effect" does not include any such effect resulting from:  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) any change, event, occurrence, or  condition
generally applicable to any of the industries in which  the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate;    
      
      |   (ii) general economic or market conditions;    
      
      |   (iii) any change, event, occurrence, or  condition
resulting from this Agreement or the announcement of  the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby,
including the dissolution of  Corn Products MCP Sweeteners LLC, a Delaware
limited liability  company _("CPMCP")_ , pursuant to the Corn  Products MCP

between the Company and Corn  Products International, Inc., or the
announcement thereof;    
      
      |   (iv) the failure to obtain any applicable  regulatory or
third-party consents that may be required in  connection with this Agreement
or the transaction contemplated  hereby; or    
      
      |   (v) changes to United States generally  accepted
accounting principles _("GAAP")_ after  the date of this Agreement.    
    

  (d) A _"Subsidiary"_ means, with respect to any party to this Agreement, any limited liability company, corporation, or other entity in which the party owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the securities or other ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect at least a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar functions. CPMCP is not deemed to be a Subsidiary of the Company.

All of the issued and outstanding equity securities of the Company and of each of its Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, and nonassessable, and were not granted in violation of any preemptive rights.

 redeem, or otherwise acquire, any units of membership interest or shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, and there are no outstanding securities convertible
into or exchangeable for any such units, capital stock, or other equity or
voting interests. There are no voting trusts, proxies, or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting of
the Class A Units. The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
issued and outstanding equity securities of every class of each of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, security interests, pledges,
charges, and other encumbrances. The Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and correct list of each corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, joint venture, or other business association or entity
in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect
equity ownership interest (other than the Subsidiaries listed in the Company

No Company SEC Report, as of its filing date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and each Company SEC Report at the time of its filing complied as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. The representation in the immediately preceding sentence does not apply to any misstatement or omission in any Company SEC Report filed before the date of this Agreement that has been superseded by a subsequent Company SEC Report filed before the date of this Agreement. From January 1, 2001 to the date of this Agreement, the Company has filed all reports and other filings that it was required to file with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC.

  (c) Except as and to the extent included in the most recent audited balance sheet contained in the Company SEC Reports (the _"Company Balance Sheet"_ ), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries had, as of the date of the Company Balance Sheet, any material obligations or liabilities of any nature that as of such date would have been required to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on such date. From the date of the Company Balance Sheet to the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material obligations or liabilities of any nature that are currently outstanding that would be required to be included in, a consolidated balance sheet of the Company dated as of the date of this Agreement prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of this Agreement, other than those arising in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (including trade indebtedness) since the date of the Company Balance Sheet.   

  SECTION 3.6 _Proxy Statement._ The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to the Company. None of the information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is mailed to the Class A Members and, after giving effect to all supplements and amendments thereto (if any), at the time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   

  SECTION 3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ From the date of the Company Balance Sheet to and including the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their    #####

  (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any default or breach by any of them under any Liens affecting the Real Property or any portion thereof, no such default or breach now exists, and no event has occurred or is continuing that, with notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder, in each case except for any such breaches or defaults that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

is in breach of or in default under any of the Material Contracts, except for

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material

The Company Disclosure Schedule specifically identifies any Plan that is wholly or partially self-insured by the Company or its controlled group.   

  (b) Each Plan, other than a multiemployer plan defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (and each related trust, insurance contract, or fund) is in material compliance in form and in operation with all applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code, and any applicable state law or regulation (except for the adoption of any required amendments for which the remedial amendment period has not expired as of the Closing Date), each such Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its plan documents and applicable laws and regulations, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there has been no breach of fiduciary duty, prohibited transaction, or other event with respect to a Plan that could result in an excise tax or other penalty against the Company or its controlled group, any Plan, or any fiduciary of a Plan. The requirements of Code Section 4980B and Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, including the provisions of those statutes relating to COBRA continuation of health coverage, and any similar requirement under any state or local law relating to continuation of employee welfare benefits, have been satisfied with respect to each Plan (excluding any multiemployer plan) that is subject to such requirements.   

  (c) Each employee pension benefit plan listed in the Company Disclosure Schedule (excluding any multiemployer plan) that is intended to be a "qualified plan" for purposes of the Code is in fact so qualified, such Plan has received a current favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service regarding its qualified status, and nothing has occurred since the date such determination letter was requested that would adversely affect such qualified status. Any voluntary employees beneficiary association maintained by the Company or its controlled group under Code Section 501(c)(9) with respect to a Plan is exempt from tax, has a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service regarding its tax exempt status, and has not incurred any unrelated business taxable income.   

  (d) Each Plan (excluding any multiemployer plan) is in compliance with the applicable requirements for reporting and disclosure to participants under ERISA with respect to that Plan, and all required annual returns and other reports for each such Plan have been filed on a timely basis with the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and any other    ##### 

  

 applicable governmental agency, excluding any such noncompliance or failure
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  

  

  (e) The Company or its controlled group has made on a timely basis all contributions and payments required pursuant to the terms of each Plan, the Code, ERISA or other applicable law, or has made accruals on the Company Balance Sheet for any such contributions or payments for such periods that are not yet due.   

  (f) At no time during the six calendar years preceding the date hereof has the Company or its controlled group maintained or made any contributions to any defined benefit pension plan or multi-employer pension plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA. If the Company or its controlled group has made any contributions to a multi-employer pension plan within the last six calendar years, the Company Disclosure Schedule specifically identifies the extent (in U.S. dollars) of any potential multi-employer withdrawal liability under ERISA Section 4201, as reported to the Company by such Plan.   

  (g) With respect to any defined benefit pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA maintained or contributed to by the Company or its controlled group, but excluding any multiemployer plan, (i) no accumulated funding deficiency, as defined in ERISA Section 302 and Code Section 412, exists, whether or not waived, (ii) there is no event or condition existing that could be deemed a reportable event within the meaning of ERISA Section 4043, (iii) no condition exists that could subject the Company or its controlled group, the Plan or any fiduciary of the Plan to any liability under ERISA Section 4062, 4063, or 4064, or a penalty under ERISA Section 4071, and (iv) the assets of each such Plan are equal to or greater than the total accrued liabilities of such Plan, whether or not vested, determined on a termination basis.   

  (h) No Plan provides health, dental, life insurance, or similar welfare benefits to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any dependent of such employee, following termination of the employees employment, except as may be required by Code Section 4980B or any similar state law.   

  (i) The Company has furnished or made available to Parent and Parent Subsidiary with respect to each Plan (excluding any multiemployer plan) correct and complete copies of all current plan documents, all amendments thereto, any related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, any current contracts with investment managers, recordkeepers or other service providers, all current summary plan descriptions and summaries of material modifications, the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500 series), the most recent actuarial valuation report (if applicable), and the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter, where applicable. In any case where such a Plan does not have written Plan documents, the Company has furnished to Parent and Parent Subsidiary a summary of the material terms of the Plan.   

  (j) No representation has been made to any employee by (or at the direction of) the Company or any officer or employee of the Company with respect to any Plan that would entitle the employee to benefits greater than or in addition to the benefits provided by the actual terms of the Plan, including representations as to post-retirement health or death benefits. No representation or promise has been made by (or at the direction of) the Company or any officer or employee of the Company to any such employee that any new Plan is to be established.

The consummation of the Merger (alone or together with any other event) will not entitle any person to accelerate the time of payment or vesting of, or increase the amount of, any compensation or any benefit under any Plan. The Merger will not result in the payment or series of payments by the Company or its controlled group to any person of an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G (or the grossing up of such a payment for taxes), or any other payment that is not fully deductible for federal income tax purposes under the Code.    ##### 

  

  (l) To the knowledge of the Company, no action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or investigation with respect to the administration of any Plan, the investment of the assets of any Plan, or any violation of a law or regulation with respect to any Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) is pending and no such action, suit, proceeding, hearing, or investigation has been threatened.

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   

  SECTION 6.1 _Special Meeting; Proxy Statement._    

  (a) The Company shall cause a special meeting of the Class A Members (the " _Special Meeting_ ") to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the Merger. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to the Class A Members that they vote in favor of approval of this Agreement and the Merger; but the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be obligated to recommend approval of this Agreement and the Merger if the Company has received a Superior Third-Party Acquisition Offer (defined in Section 6.2(a)) and the Board of Directors of the Company determines that it wishes to recommend approval of the Superior Third-Party Acquisition Offer, and, therefore, that the recommendation of approval of this Agreement and the Merger should be withdrawn.   

  (b) The Company, Parent, and Parent Subsidiary, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this Agreement, shall prepare a proxy statement, together with a form of proxy, with respect to the Special Meeting (such proxy statement, together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, being called the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company shall use reasonable efforts to have the Proxy    ##### 

  

 Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable and, as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter, shall cause copies of the Proxy Statement
and form of proxy to be mailed to the Class A Members in accordance with
the Companys operating agreement and applicable provisions of law. The
Proxy Statement and form of proxy shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of Colorado law and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. After
the delivery to the Class A Members of copies of the Proxy Statement and
form of proxy, the Company, Parent, and Parent Subsidiary shall use
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in connection with the Special
Meeting in favor of approval of this Agreement and the Merger, unless the
Company has received a Superior Third-Party Acquisition Offer and the Board
of Directors of the Company determines that it wishes to recommend approval
of the Superior Third-Party Acquisition Offer, and, therefore, that such
solicitation should not be made.  

  

  (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.1, the Company shall engage a nationally recognized proxy solicitor (that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and Parent Subsidiary) to solicit proxies in connection with the Special Meeting in favor of approval of this Agreement and the Merger.   

  SECTION 6.2 _No Shopping._    

  (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and will not permit any officer, director, financial adviser, or other agent or representative of the Company and its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) take any action to seek, encourage,  initiate, or
solicit any offer or proposal from any person or  group to acquire any equity
securities of the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries, to merge or
consolidate with the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries, or to otherwise
acquire, except to the  extent not prohibited by Section 5.3, any
significant  portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken  as whole (a " _Third-Party Acquisition  Offer_ "); or    
      
      |   (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations  concerning a
Third-Party Acquisition Offer with any person or  group, or disclose non-
public financial information relating to  the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other non-public  confidential or proprietary trade or
business information  relating to the business of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries, or afford access to the properties, books, or  records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or otherwise  cooperate in any way with,
any person or group that the Company  has reason to believe is considering a
Third-Party Acquisition  Offer, unless (A) before furnishing such information
or  access to such person or group, the Companys Board of  Directors has
received from such person an executed  confidentiality agreement that is no
less favorable to the  Company than the Confidentiality Agreement between
Parent and  the Company dated April 26, 2002 (the  " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") and all  information provided to such person or group is
provided on a  substantially concurrent basis to Parent and Parent
Subsidiary  if such information has not previously been provided to Parent 
and Parent Subsidiary, and (B) before entering into  discussions or
negotiations with such person or group (other  than as necessary to receive
and understand the Third-Party  Acquisition Offer or to obtain information
relating to such  person or group with respect to its ability to obtain
financing  for the Third-Party Acquisition Offer), the Companys Board  of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with  its outside
legal counsel and financial adviser, that the  Third-Party Acquisition Offer
is reasonably likely to be more  favorable to the Class A Members than the
Merger and for  which financing, to the extent required, is committed or, in
the  good-faith judgment of the Companys Board of Directors, is  reasonably
capable of being obtained by the third party (a  "Superior Third-Party
Acquisition Offer").    
    

  (b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth above, the Company shall promptly advise Parent and Parent Subsidiary orally and in writing of any Third-Party Acquisition Offer or any inquiry or request for information that the Company reasonably believes could lead to a Third-Party Acquisition Offer and the terms and conditions thereof, including the identity of the offeror or person making the request or inquiry, and the Company shall keep Parent and Parent Subsidiary informed in all material respects of the status and details thereof (including changes or amendments thereto).    #####

Each such representative will conduct such investigation in a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and will take all reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of any information of the Company and its Subsidiaries disclosed to such persons during such investigation.   

  SECTION 6.4 _Resignations. _ The Company will use reasonable efforts to assist Parent and Parent Subsidiary in procuring the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of all of the members of the Boards of Directors (or similar governing bodies) of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, and entitlement to benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accrual), employees employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ ") shall be credited with their service from last date of hire with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether before or after the Effective Time) under any compensation, severance, welfare, pension, benefit, or savings plan (excluding any retiree medical or health care plans) of Parent or any of its affiliates in which such employees become eligible to participate as if such service had been rendered to Parent or such affiliate.   

  (b) For the one-year period following the Closing, Parent shall either (i) continue the existing group health plan of the Company with respect to the Company Employees on the same terms and conditions as in effect on the date of this Agreement or (ii) include the Company Employees in the group health plan of Parent and its affiliates provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its affiliates on the same terms and conditions as provided to such other employees. If Parent extends its group health plan to Company Employees during the plan year that includes the Closing, the group health plans of Parent and its affiliates shall credit the Company Employees and their covered dependents with their out-of-pocket expenses incurred under the Companys group health plan prior to the Closing and shall waive any limitations on pre-existing condition exclusions to the extent the same have been satisfied by an affected Company Employee (or his or her dependent) under the Companys group health plan.   

  (c) For the period from Closing through December 31, 2002, Parent and Parent Subsidiary shall cause the Surviving Organization to maintain the Companys severance plan for the benefit of the Company employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and neither the Surviving Organization nor any affiliate shall terminate or adversely amend the Companys severance plan or take any other action that would adversely affect any Company Employees rights to receive benefits under the Companys severance plan or the amount of such benefits as provided in the Companys severance plan immediately prior to the Closing.   

  (d) Parent and Parent Subsidiary shall cause the Surviving Organization to honor in full all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under all employment agreements, change-in-control agreements, and nonqualified deferred compensation plans set forth in Section 3.10 or 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.    #####

  SECTION 6.7 _Indemnification. _ All rights to indemnification, expense advancement, and exculpation existing in favor of any present or former director, officer, or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the articles of organization, operating agreement, or similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by law as in effect on the date hereof shall survive the Merger for a period of six years after the Effective Time (or, in the event any relevant claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, until final disposition of such claim) with respect to matters occurring at or before the Effective Time, and no action taken during such period shall be deemed to diminish the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.   

  SECTION 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Liability Insurance. _For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent, Parent Subsidiary, or the Surviving Organization shall maintain in effect either (a) the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent, Parent Subsidiary, or the Surviving Organization may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous in any material respect to the insured parties thereunder) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (including consummation of the Merger), or (b) a run-off (or "tail") policy or endorsement with respect to the current policy of directors and officers liability insurance covering claims asserted within six years after the Effective Time arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time (including consummation of the Merger); and such policies or endorsements shall name as insureds thereunder all present and former directors and officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  SECTION 6.9 _Cooperation. _ Before the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by law (as determined in the good-faith judgment of the Company), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to:   

  (a) confer on a regular and reasonably frequent basis with representatives of Parent and Parent Subsidiary to discuss material operational matters and the general status of its ongoing operations, in each case other than matters relating to prices received by the Company and its Subsidiaries for their products and other than pricing and marketing strategies;
