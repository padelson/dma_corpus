NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") and the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act (the "LLC Act"), on the Closing Date Deltic shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence
of Deltic shall cease, and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving company
in the Merger (the "Surviving Company") and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Potlatch.

 

Section 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10017 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business
Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by
the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set
forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the  satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those
conditions), or at such other place, time and date as may be agreed in writing
between Potlatch and Deltic. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred
to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall (a) file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the
LLC Act and (b) make all other filings required under the DGCL and the LLC Act
or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such later time as Potlatch and Deltic shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective
being the "Effective Time").

Section 1.04.  _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the LLC Act.

 

Section 1.05. _Limited Liability Company Agreement_. The limited liability
company agreement of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company,
until amended after the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions
thereof and hereof and applicable Law.

 

Section 1.06. _Officers of the Surviving Company_. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the officers of the Surviving Company, until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Companys limited liability company agreement and applicable Law.

ARTICLE 2

 

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Potlatch, Merger Sub, Deltic
or any holder of any of the following securities:

(a) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Deltic ("Deltic Common Stock") that is owned by Deltic as
treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



2 (b) _Conversion of Deltic Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02, each share
of Deltic Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(a)) shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of Potlatch (the "Potlatch Common Stock") equal to
the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger Consideration"). All such shares of Deltic
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Deltic Common Stock (each such certificate, a "Certificate") or
shares of Deltic Common Stock held in direct registration form ("Book-Entry
Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Potlatch Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and
any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled in
accordance with Section 2.02, in each case, without interest. For purposes of
this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" means 1.80. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding Potlatch Common Stock or shares of Deltic Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination,
consolidation, subdivision, reclassification or exchange of shares, or any
similar event (including, as applicable, any stock dividend for the purpose of
distributing earnings so as to maintain qualification as a REIT or to cure any
issue of qualification as a REIT) shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein that is based upon the number of shares of
Potlatch Common Stock or shares of Deltic Common Stock, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Potlatch and the holders of
Deltic Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence
shall not be construed to permit Potlatch or Deltic to take any action with
respect to its securities that is prohibited by Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b),
as applicable.

(c) _Merger Sub Interests_. Each limited liability company interest of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain as an issued and outstanding limited liability company interest of the
Surviving Company and each such limited liability company interest shall
continue to be owned by Potlatch and will be the only limited liability
company interests in Merger Sub immediately after the Effective Time.

Section 2.02.  _Exchange._

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Potlatch shall appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Deltic to act as exchange
agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Potlatch shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the former holders of Deltic Common Stock entitled
to receive Merger Consideration under Section 2.01(b), for exchange in
accordance with this Article 2 through the Exchange Agent, a sufficient number
of shares of Potlatch Common Stock (whether represented in 

 



3  certificated or non-certificated direct registration form) to issue the
aggregate Merger Consideration. From time to time as needed as
reasonably determined by Potlatch, Potlatch shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.02(f) and to pay any dividends or other distributions which
former holders of Deltic Common Stock have the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(d). All such cash and Potlatch Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter,
Potlatch shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Deltic Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the "Letter of
Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Potlatch may specify subject to Deltics reasonable
approval, together with instructions thereto.

(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange.

 

(i) After the Effective Time, upon the surrender of a Certificate for
cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (A) the Merger Consideration into which the
shares of Deltic Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Deltic Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of Deltic, the proper number of shares of Potlatch Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of
any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
(or, for Book-Entry Shares, proper evidence of such transfer) representing
such Deltic Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each Certificate Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder of such
Certificates were entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.01 (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable under this Section
2.02(c) or under Section 2.02(d), 2.02(e) or 2.02(f).

 



4 (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to each former holder of Book-Entry Shares (A) the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Deltic Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(f). No such holder shall be required to deliver a Letter of Transmittal.
The shares of Potlatch Common Stock deliverable to any holder under this
Section 2.02(c)(ii) shall be deemed issued to such holder on the Closing Date
and consequently, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to any dividends
or distributions with a record date after the Effective Time in the same
manner as other holders of shares of Potlatch Common Stock.

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Potlatch Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Potlatch Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this Article 2. Subject to abandoned
property, escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Potlatch
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Potlatch
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Potlatch
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Potlatch Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Deltic Common Stock_. The shares of
Potlatch Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article 2 upon conversion of any shares of Deltic Common Stock (including
any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(f)) shall be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Deltic Common Stock, subject to the Surviving Companys obligation to pay any
dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective
Time that may have been declared or made by Deltic on such shares of
Deltic Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Company of shares of Deltic Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of
Section 2.02(h), if, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented
for transfer to the Surviving Company, Potlatch or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Potlatch Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Deltic Common
Stock

 



5  pursuant to Section 2.01(b), and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of shares of
Potlatch Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Deltic Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger
who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Potlatch Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares surrendered or owned by such holder and after aggregating all
fractional shares that would otherwise be received by such holder into whole
shares) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal to
such fractional amount multiplied by the average of the volume weighted
average price per share of Potlatch Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market ("Nasdaq") (as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. or, if not reported by
Bloomberg, L.P., in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Potlatch and Deltic) on each of the five consecutive trading days ending with
the last complete trading day prior to the Closing Date.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of Deltic Common Stock for 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Potlatch, upon demand, and any
former holder of Deltic Common Stock who has not previously complied with
this Article 2 (as applicable) shall thereafter look only to Potlatch for,
and Potlatch shall remain liable for, payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
2.

(h) _No Liability_. None of Potlatch, Merger Sub, Deltic or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered
or transferred prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect
thereof would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Law, any Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Potlatch, free and clear of all claims or interests of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Potlatch. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Potlatch; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Potlatch or
the Exchange Agent from promptly making the payments required by this Article
2, and following any losses from any such investment, Potlatch shall promptly
provide additional cash funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Deltic Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount
of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Exchange Fund.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Potlatch, Deltic, and the Exchange Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Article 2, Section 6.04, or
otherwise in connection in 

 



6  this Agreement to any Person such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax
Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Potlatch, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and
customary amount as Potlatch may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
(or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to

ARTICLE 3

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF POTLATCH

 

Potlatch represents and warrants to Deltic that the statements contained in
this Article 3 are true and correct, except (i) as set forth in the Potlatch
Reporting Documents publicly available and filed with or furnished to the SEC
after January 1, 2016 and at least two Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Filed Potlatch Reporting Documents") (excluding (x) any
exhibits to the Filed Potlatch Reporting Documents and (y) any disclosures in
the Filed Potlatch Reporting Documents(A) in any risk factors section, (B) in
the "Forward-Looking Statements" section and (C) in any other disclosures
that are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (i) subject to
Section 9.05, as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Potlatch to
Deltic prior to the execution and delivery by Potlatch of this Agreement (the
"Potlatch Disclosure Letter").

Section 3.01. Organization, Standing and Power.

 

(a) Each of Potlatch and each of Potlatchs Subsidiaries (the "Potlatch
Subsidiaries") is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good
standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except
where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Potlatch Material Adverse Effect. Each of Potlatch and each
Potlatch Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, operation or
leasing of its properties and assets makes such qualification necessary, other
than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Potlatch Material Adverse Effect. Potlatch has made
available to Deltic, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete
copies of the (i) certificate of incorporation of Potlatch in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (the "Potlatch Charter") and the bylaws of Potlatch
in effect as of the date

 



7  of this Agreement (the "Potlatch By-laws") and (ii) the certificate of
formation of Merger Sub in effect as of the date of this Agreement and the

Ownership Limit", as such terms are defined in the Potlatch Charter.

 

Section 3.02. _Potlatch Subsidiaries._

 

(a) All the outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, each Potlatch Subsidiary have been validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable and are wholly owned by Potlatch, by
another Potlatch Subsidiary or by Potlatch and another Potlatch Subsidiary,
free and clear of all pledges, liens, claims, charges, mortgages, encumbrances
and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively,
"Liens"), and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests), except for restrictions imposed by
applicable securities Laws. Section 3.02(a) of the Potlatch Disclosure Letter
sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the
Potlatch Subsidiaries, including a list of each Potlatch Subsidiary that is a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the
Code (a "Qualified REIT Subsidiary") or a "taxable REIT subsidiary"
within the meaning of Section 856(1) of the Code (a "Taxable REIT
Subsidiary") together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
as the case may be, of each Potlatch Subsidiary and the classification for
U.S. federal income tax purposes of each Potlatch Subsidiary.

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Potlatch Subsidiaries, neither Potlatch nor any Potlatch
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, or any interest convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or voting securities
of, or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation, partnership, company,
limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association or other entity
other than ordinary course investments in publicly traded securities
constituting one percent or less of a class of outstanding securities of any
entity.

similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the Potlatch Charter, the
Potlatch By-laws or any Contract to which Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary
is a party or otherwise bound (including the Potlatch Stock Plans). The

Subsidiary. Except pursuant to the Potlatch Stock Plans, there are not any
outstanding obligations of Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, 

 



9  Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary or any securities, interests, warrants,
calls, options or other rights referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the
immediately preceding sentence. There are no debentures, bonds, notes or
other Indebtedness of Potlatch having the right to vote (or convertible into,
or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which stockholders of Potlatch may vote (collectively, "Potlatch Voting
Debt"). Neither Potlatch nor any Potlatch Subsidiary is a party to any voting
agreement with respect to the voting of any capital stock or voting securities
of, or other equity interests in, Potlatch. Except for this Agreement,
neither Potlatch nor any Potlatch Subsidiary is a party to any agreement

Section 3.04. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._

 

(a) Potlatch and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate or limited liability
company (as applicable) power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform their obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the
case of the Share Issuance, to the receipt of the Potlatch Stockholder
Approval. The Board of Directors of Potlatch (the "Potlatch Board") has
adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called at which a
quorum of directors of Potlatch was present, (i) approving and adopting this
Agreement, (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement is in the best
interests of Potlatch and its stockholders, (iii) declaring this Agreement
advisable, and (iv) recommending that Potlatchs stockholders vote in favor of
approval of the issuance of shares of Potlatch Common Stock constituting the
Merger Consideration (the "Share Issuance") and directing that the Share
Issuance be submitted to Potlatchs stockholders for approval at a duly held
meeting of such stockholders for such purpose (the "Potlatch Stockholders
Meeting") (clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being referred to as the
"Potlatch Recommendation"). Such resolutions have not been amended
or withdrawn as of the date of this Agreement. Potlatch, as the sole member
of Merger Sub, has approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger. Except
for the approval of the Share Issuance by the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Potlatch Common Stock at the
Potlatch Stockholders Meeting, as required by Nasdaq Rule 5635(d) (the
"Potlatch Stockholder Approval"), no other corporate or limited liability
company proceedings on the part of Potlatch or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize, adopt or approve this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the filing of
the appropriate 

 



10  merger documents as required by the DGCL and the LLC Act). Potlatch and
Merger Sub have duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Deltic, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Potlatch and Merger
Sub, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles
of equity.

(b) The Potlatch Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to
render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement the restrictions on "business combinations" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL.
No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar
antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in respect of Potlatch.

Section 3.05. _No Conflicts; Consents._

 

(a) The execution and delivery by Potlatch and Merger Sub of this Agreement
does not, and the performance by Potlatch and Merger Sub of their obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of
any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or redeem any
Indebtedness or capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests or
any loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary
under, any provision of (i) the Potlatch Charter, the Potlatch By-laws or

Approval is obtained), (ii) any contract, lease, license, indenture, note,
bond, agreement, concession, franchise or other binding instrument (a
"Contract") to which Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or any Potlatch
Permit or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in
Section 3.05(b), any judgment, order or decree of a Governmental Entity or
arbitrator ("Judgment") or statute, law (including common law), ordinance,
rule or regulation, including the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") and Nasdaq ("Law"), in each case applicable to Potlatch or
any Potlatch Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets (assuming
that the Potlatch Stockholder Approval is obtained), other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Potlatch Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this
Section 3.05(a), effects resulting from or arising in connection with the
matters set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material
Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in determining whether a Potlatch
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to

delay the consummation of the Merger.

promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act"), and with any other applicable federal,
state or foreign laws that are designed to govern foreign investment
or competition, or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or effect of monopolization, lessening of competition or restraint
of trade (together with the HSR Act, the "Antitrust Laws"), (B) the

and (D) the filing with the SEC of such reports and other filings under, and

(the "Exchange Act") and the Securities Act, as may be required in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) Consents, registrations, declarations, notices or
filings set forth in Section 3.05(b) of the Potlatch Disclosure Letter, (iii)

notices or filings to or with the NYSE and/or Nasdaq as are required to permit
the consummation of the Merger and the listing of the shares of Potlatch
Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration and (vi) such other matters
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Potlatch Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that
for purposes of this Section 3.05(b), effects resulting from or arising in
connection with the matters set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the
term "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in determining whether a
Potlatch Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected
to occur) and would not prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder
or delay the consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 3.06. _Reporting Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities._

 

(a) Potlatch has furnished or filed all material reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by Potlatch with the
SEC since January 1, 2015 (such documents, excluding the Joint Proxy Statement
and the Form S-4, being collectively referred to as the "Potlatch Reporting
Documents").

 



12 (b) Each Potlatch Reporting Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
("SOX"), the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as applicable to such
Potlatch Reporting Document and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if
amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this
Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of Potlatch included in the Potlatch
Reporting Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in all
material respects in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, as indicated in the notes thereto or,
in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations
of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Potlatch and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

 

(c) Neither Potlatch nor any Potlatch Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent
or otherwise) except for (i) liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the balance sheet in the Potlatch Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the period ended December 31, 2016 (including any notes thereto), (ii)
liabilities that were incurred or arose since December 31, 2016 in the
ordinary course of business of Potlatch, (iii) liabilities incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
(iv) other liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had or
would not reasonably be expected to have a Potlatch Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Potlatch and the principal
financial officer of Potlatch (or each former principal executive officer of
Potlatch and each former principal financial officer of Potlatch) has made all
applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Potlatch
Reporting Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were
true and correct in all material respects at the time made. For purposes of
this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither Potlatch
nor any Potlatch Subsidiary has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX.

(e) Potlatch maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) designed to 

 



13  provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Potlatchs
properties or assets.

 

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by Potlatch are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Potlatch in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Potlatch, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of Potlatch to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(g) Since January 1, 2016, none of Potlatch, Potlatchs independent
accountants, the Potlatch Board or the audit committee of the Potlatch Board
has received any oral or written notification of any (i) "significant
deficiency" in the internal controls over financial reporting of
Potlatch, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over financial
reporting of Potlatch or (iii) fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees of Potlatch who have a significant role in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Potlatch. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" shall
have the meanings assigned to them in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

Section 3.07. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Potlatch or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with
the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is
declared effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to each of Potlatchs
stockholders and Deltics stockholders or at the time of each of the
Potlatch Stockholders Meeting and the Deltic Stockholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by Potlatch with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information

to have been filed and such Tax Returns are accurate and complete in all
material respects; (ii) each of Potlatch and each Potlatch Subsidiary has paid
all material Taxes required to have been paid other than Taxes that are
not yet due or that are being contested in good faith in appropriate
proceedings; and (iii) no deficiency for any material Tax has been asserted or
assessed by a taxing authority against Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary
which deficiency has not been paid or is not being contested in good faith in
appropriate proceedings. Potlatch and each Potlatch Subsidiary have

received by Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary. No deficiencies for any
material Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against Potlatch or
any Potlatch Subsidiary, and no requests for waivers or extensions of the time
to assess any such Taxes are pending or have been granted (other than in
connection with any extension of time to file any Tax Return). No other
procedure, proceeding or contest of any refund or deficiency in respect of
material Taxes is pending in or on appeal from any Governmental Entity.

Potlatch, other claim has been received by Potlatch or any Potlatch
Subsidiary from an authority in a jurisdiction where such corporation does not
file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to material taxation by such
jurisdiction. Neither Potlatch nor any Potlatch Subsidiary is a party to or
is otherwise bound by any material Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
Contract (other than such a Contract exclusively between or among Potlatch and
wholly owned Potlatch Subsidiaries or customary tax gross-up or tax indemnity
provisions in a credit agreement, purchase agreement, or other commercial
agreement the primary purpose of which does not relate to Taxes).

the common parent of which was Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary) or (ii)
has any liability for material Taxes of any person (other than Potlatch
or any Potlatch Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Laws), as a transferee or

Adverse Effect. Each Potlatch Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable

have occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification status of any such Potlatch Benefit Plan, except where such loss
of qualification status would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Potlatch Material Adverse Effect. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Potlatch Material Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge

Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto that could result in any liability

(a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors
at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of
Section 4063 of ERISA, and none of Potlatch and its Subsidiaries nor any of
their Commonly Controlled Entities has incurred any liability to a
Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA.

 



18 (f) Section 3.10(f) of the Potlatch Disclosure Letter sets forth each Potlatch

any party of its obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction
with any other event, including any termination of employment on or
following the Effective Time) will (i) entitle any Potlatch Personnel to any
material compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any material compensation or
benefit or trigger any other material obligation under any Potlatch Benefit
Plan or Potlatch Benefit Agreement or any other transaction-based payments,
(iii) result in any breach or violation of, or default under, or limit
Potlatchs right to extend, renew, replace, amend, modify or terminate, any
Potlatch Benefit Plan or Potlatch Benefit Agreement or (iv) result in any
payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) that could,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, subject any
Person to Section 4999 of the Code or result in the non-deductibility of any
payment under Section 280G of the Code. No Potlatch Benefit Plan or Potlatch
Benefit Agreement provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under

(a) Deltic has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the receipt of the Deltic

proceedings on the part of Deltic are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL and the LLC Act). Deltic has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Potlatch, this Agreement constitutes its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

(b) The Deltic Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to render
inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement the restrictions on "business combinations" (as

No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar
antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in respect of Deltic.

Section 4.05. _No Conflicts; Consents._

 

(a) The execution and delivery by Deltic of this Agreement does not, and the
performance by Deltic of its obligations hereunder and the consummation by
Deltic of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right
of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation, any obligation
to make an offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock,
voting securities or other equity interests or any loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the
Deltic Charter, the Deltic Bylaws or the comparable organizational documents
of any Deltic Subsidiary that is a "significant subsidiary" as defined in

or any Deltic Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective

filings and other matters referred to in Section 4.05(b), any Judgment or
Law, in each case applicable to Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary or their
respective properties or assets (assuming that the Deltic Stockholder Approval
is obtained), other than, in the case of 

 



29  clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Deltic
Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section
4.05(a), effects resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set
forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect"
shall not be excluded in determining whether a Deltic Material Adverse Effect
has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent
or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger.

 

(b) No Consent of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing made
to or with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or

Merger and the listing of the shares of Potlatch Common Stock to be issued as
Merger Consideration and (vi) such other matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Deltic
Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section

forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect"
shall not be excluded in determining whether a Deltic Material Adverse Effect

Merger.

 

Section 4.06. _Reporting Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities._

 

(a) Deltic has furnished or filed all material reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information

the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of Deltic

as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was
prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP (except, as

permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated

obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent

applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Deltic Reporting
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications were true and

Deltic Subsidiary has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX.

 

(e) Deltic maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) designed
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Deltics properties or assets.

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by Deltic are reasonably
designed to

 



31  ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Deltic in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Deltic, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of Deltic to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. 

(g) Since January 1, 2016, none of Deltic, Deltics independent accountants,
the Deltic Board or the audit committee of the Deltic Board has received any
oral or written notification of any (i) "significant deficiency" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of Deltic, (ii) "material weakness"
in the internal controls over financial reporting of Deltic or (iii) fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees of Deltic
who have a significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting
of Deltic.

 

Section 4.07. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by Deltic for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time it
is amended or supplemented or at the time it is declared effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to each of Potlatchs stockholders and Deltics
stockholders or at the time of each of the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting and
the Deltic Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by Deltic with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Potlatch
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

Adverse Effect. Each Deltic Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a favorable
opinion issued by the IRS, and there are no circumstances or any events that
have occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification status of any such Deltic Benefit Plan, except where such loss
of qualification status would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Deltic Material Adverse Effect. Except as

Deltic Material Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Deltic, threatened claims by, on behalf of or against any Deltic

applicable Law) have been made.

 

(e) None of Deltic and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years,
maintained, established, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to
any Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at
least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section

Commonly Controlled Entities has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer

(f) Section 4.10(f) of the Deltic Disclosure Letter sets forth each Deltic
Benefit Plan and Deltic Benefit Agreement that provides health, medical or

the Deltic Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination of employment,
other than coverage or benefits (i) required to be provided under Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA, Section 4980(6)(f) of the Code or any other applicable Law
or (ii) the full cost of which is borne by such Deltic Personnel (or any of

any party of its obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction
with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following

as a regarded corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (C) any
Potlatch Subsidiary that is a Taxable REIT Subsidiary or a REIT, as the case
may be, to cease to be treated as such (provided, for the avoidance of doubt,
that nothing in clauses (B) or (C) shall limit Potlatchs discretion in
determining the initial U.S. federal income tax classification of any newly
formed entity);

 

(xvi) exempt any "Person" from the "Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit," as such
terms are defined in the Potlatch Charter;

(xvii) (A) make, change or rescind any material method of Tax accounting, (B)
make a request for a Tax ruling or enter into a closing agreement, or settle
or compromise any audit, assessment, Tax claim or other controversy, in each
case relating to Taxes that exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate, (C) file any
material amended Tax Return, (D) surrender any right to claim a refund or
offset of any Taxes that exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate or (E) change the
classification of Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary for U.S. federal income
tax purposes (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that nothing in this
clause (E) shall limit Potlatchs discretion in determining the initial U.S.
federal income tax classification of any newly formed entity), except, in the
case of each of the foregoing clauses (A) through (E), to qualify or preserve
the status of Potlatch as a REIT under the Code or to qualify or preserve the
status of any Potlatch Subsidiary as a partnership or disregarded entity for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes or as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary, a Taxable
REIT Subsidiary or a REIT, as the case may be; or

(xviii) authorize or enter into any Contract to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.01(a) or anything
else set forth in this Agreement, but subject to 
Section 6.16(b), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Potlatch from taking
or refraining to take any action, at any time or from time to time, that in
the reasonable judgment of Potlatch is reasonably necessary or appropriate
for Potlatch to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT under the
Code for any period, to eliminate or reduce entity level income or excise
Taxes under Sections 856, 857, 860 and 4981 of the Code (and similar
provisions of state or local Tax Law) for any period, and to preserve the
status of any Potlatch Subsidiary as a partnership or disregarded entity for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes or as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary, Taxable
REIT Subsidiary, or REIT, as the case may be; provided, however, that such
action or inaction, to the extent it would otherwise constitute a breach by
Potlatch of this Agreement but for this sentence, shall not in the reasonable
determination of Deltic adversely affect the value of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Deltic or its stockholders in
any material respect.

(b) _Conduct of Business by Deltic_. Except for matters set forth in Section
5.01(b) of the Deltic Disclosure Letter or otherwise expressly permitted or
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or with the prior written consent of
Potlatch (which shall 

 



47  not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as required by Law,
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Deltic shall, and shall
cause each Deltic Subsidiary to, (i) conduct its business in the ordinary
course in all material respects and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
preserve intact its business organization and business relationships. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for
matters set forth in Section 5.01(b) of the Deltic Disclosure Letter or
otherwise expressly permitted or expressly contemplated by this Agreement or
with the prior written consent of Potlatch (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as required by Law, from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, Deltic shall not, and shall not permit any
Deltic Subsidiary to, do any of the following:

5.01(b)(ii) or Section 5.01(b)(iv), or (C) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, or offer to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any capital

declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of Deltic or any Deltic
Subsidiary or (F) any Deltic Voting Debt, in each case other than

impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation by Deltic of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(iv) except for actions required pursuant to the terms of any Deltic Benefit
Plan or Deltic Benefit Agreement or the Deltic Stock Plan, as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, or as required by Law, (A) grant to any Deltic

to the Effective Time, Potlatch shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
the Potlatch Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

(d) _No Control of Deltic_ __ _s Business_. Potlatch acknowledges and agrees
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give Potlatch,

conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
the Deltic Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

Section 5.02. _No Solicitation by Potlatch; Potlatch Board Recommendation_.
(a) Potlatch shall, and shall instruct its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Potlatch Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal
that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Potlatch Takeover Proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any such Person or its Representatives in connection
with any potential Potlatch Takeover Proposal and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person
or its Representatives. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the date of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 8, Potlatch shall not, nor shall it authorize any of
its Affiliates or any of its or their respective directors, officers or
employees or any of their respective investment bankers, accountants,
attorneys or other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, or
knowingly encourage or facilitate any Potlatch Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Potlatch
Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into or

 



52  participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any
information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any Person who has
made or, to Potlatchs Knowledge, is seeking to make, a Potlatch Takeover
Proposal with respect to any Potlatch Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Potlatch Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Potlatch Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Potlatch
Takeover Proposal that the Potlatch Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Potlatch Proposal, and which Potlatch Takeover Proposal was made
after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of
the non-solicitation provisions of this Section 5.02(a), Potlatch may (and
may authorize the Potlatch Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section 5.02(c), (x) furnish
information with respect to Potlatch and the Potlatch Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Potlatch Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) (
_provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Deltic
or is provided to Deltic prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it
is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement; 
_provided_ that such confidentiality agreement shall not be required to
contain standstill provisions (a "Potlatch Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement") and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of
such Potlatch Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and
only with, the Person making such Potlatch Takeover Proposal (and such
Persons Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by (x)
any controlled Affiliate of Potlatch or (y) any other Affiliates of Potlatch
or any of its or their Representatives which violation was known by Potlatch
(unless promptly after Potlatch knew of such violation it took all reasonable
actions to cause such violation to cease), in each case shall constitute a
breach of this Section 5.02(a) by Potlatch. If Potlatch or any of its
Representatives receives any inquiry from any Person regarding a Potlatch
Takeover Proposal, nothing herein shall prohibit Potlatch from directing such
Person to this Section 5.02(a).

 

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Potlatch Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Deltic),
or propose publicly to withdraw (or to modify in any manner adverse to
Deltic), the Potlatch Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any Potlatch Takeover Proposal or (ii) approve, recommend
or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or allow Potlatch or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
or comparable Contract (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") (other than a
Potlatch Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) constituting or relating to, or
that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Potlatch
Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Potlatch to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
prevent or materially impede, interfere with or

 



53  delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (any action in clause (i) or clause (ii) (other
than Potlatch or any Potlatch Affiliate executing or entering into any
Acquisition Agreement (other than a Potlatch Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement)) being referred to as a "Potlatch Adverse Recommendation Change").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Potlatch
Stockholder Approval, the Potlatch Board may make a Potlatch Adverse
Recommendation Change if (i) Potlatch receives a Superior Potlatch Proposal or
(ii) a Potlatch Intervening Event occurs and, in each case, the Potlatch
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Potlatch shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to make a Potlatch Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a
Potlatch Takeover Proposal or a Superior Potlatch Proposal or a Potlatch
Intervening Event until after the fifth Business Day following Deltics
receipt of written notice (a "Potlatch Notice of Recommendation Change") from
Potlatch advising Deltic that the Potlatch Board intends to take such action,
including the terms and conditions of any Potlatch Takeover Proposal or
Superior Potlatch Proposal or the nature of the Potlatch Intervening Event
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Potlatch Board (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any
material change to any material term of such Potlatch Takeover Proposal or
Superior Potlatch Proposal shall require a new Potlatch Notice of
Recommendation Change, except that references to the five Business Day period
above shall be deemed to be references to a two Business Day period). In
determining whether to make a Potlatch Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Potlatch Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Deltic in response to a Potlatch Notice of
Recommendation Change or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Potlatch set forth in Sections 5.02(a)
and 5.02(b), Potlatch shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day
of receipt thereof by Potlatch) advise Deltic in writing of any Potlatch
Takeover Proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a
Potlatch Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Potlatch Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making any such Potlatch Takeover Proposal. Potlatch
shall (i) keep Deltic informed in all material respects of the status and
details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any Potlatch
Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to Deltic as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all written and electronic
materials that describe any Potlatch Takeover Proposal and any material
amendments thereto exchanged between Potlatch or any of the Potlatch
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives and any other Person who
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Potlatch Takeover Proposal.

(d) At any time prior to obtaining the Potlatch Stockholder Approval,
provided that Potlatch and its Affiliates have complied in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of this Section 5.02, the Potlatch
Board may, concurrently with making a Potlatch Adverse Recommendation Change,
cause Potlatch to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g)
(including payment of the Potlatch Termination Fee) and concurrently enter
into a binding definitive agreement providing for such Superior Potlatch
Proposal.

 



54 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Potlatch from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or issuing a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Potlatch if, in the good faith judgment of the Potlatch Board
(after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Potlatch Intervening Event" means any event, change, effect, development or
occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that
materially affects the business, assets or operations of Potlatch or Deltic
(provided that, in the case of a Potlatch Intervening Event that relates to
any event, change, effect, development or occurrence that materially affect
the business, assets or operations of Deltic rather than the business, assets
or operations of Potlatch, the Potlatch Board must have concluded in good
faith that such Potlatch Intervening Event has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Deltic Material Adverse Effect) and that (i) was not
known, or reasonably foreseeable, to the Board of Directors of Potlatch as of
or prior to the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material
breach of this Agreement by Potlatch and (ii) does not relate to or involve a
Superior Potlatch Proposal or Potlatch Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,
however, that no such event, change, effect, development or occurrence shall
be taken into account in determining whether a Potlatch Intervening Event has
occurred or arisen to the extent that it results from or arises out of: (i)
changes or conditions generally affecting any of the industries in which
Potlatch or Deltic operates, (ii) general economic or political conditions
within the region of the United States in which Potlatch or Deltic has
operations; (iii) any change in applicable Law or GAAP (or authoritative
interpretation of Law or GAAP); (iv) any failure, in and of itself, by
Deltic to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates or
predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating
metrics for any period (it being understood that the facts or occurrences
giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute,
or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be a
Potlatch Intervening Event unless otherwise excluded in this definition of
"Potlatch Intervening Event"); (v) any occurrence, in and of itself, in which
Potlatch exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates
or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or
operating metrics for any period (it being understood that the facts or
occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such exceedance may be deemed to
constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or
will be, a Potlatch Intervening Event unless otherwise excluded in
this definition of "Potlatch Intervening Event"); (vi) compliance by Potlatch
or Deltic with or performance by Potlatch or Deltic under this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; or (vii) any change, in and of itself,
in the market price or trading value of Potlatch Common Stock or Deltic
Common Stock (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to
or contributing to such change may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or will be a Potlatch

 



55  Intervening Event unless otherwise excluded in this definition of "Potlatch
Intervening Event") (except, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) to the
extent such change or condition has a materially disproportionate effect on
Potlatch and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Deltic and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable, relative to others in the
industries in which Potlatch and its Subsidiaries or Deltic and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, operate).

"Potlatch Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) made by any Person or Persons other than Deltic or any of its
Affiliates, with respect to any (i) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
recapitalization, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, a Potlatch Subsidiary or
otherwise) of any business or assets of Potlatch or the Potlatch Subsidiaries
representing 25% or more of the consolidated revenues, consolidated net income
or consolidated assets of Potlatch and the Potlatch Subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for or representing 25% or
more of the total outstanding voting power of Potlatch, (ii) transaction in
which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly
or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right
to acquire beneficial ownership of, 25% or more of the total outstanding
voting power of Potlatch or (iii) combination of the foregoing (in each
case, other than the Merger).

"Superior Potlatch Proposal" means any binding bona fide written offer that
did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of
Section 5.02(a) made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third
party (or in a merger or consolidation involving such party, the stockholders
of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the Potlatch Common Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of
Potlatch and the Potlatch Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which
the Potlatch Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor) to be more favorable from a financial point
of view to the holders of Potlatch Common Stock than the Merger, taking into
account all the material terms and conditions of such offer (including the
material legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal) and of this
Agreement (including any changes proposed by Deltic to the terms of this
Agreement) and (ii) that the Potlatch Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor) is otherwise
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed taking into
account all material legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal.

Section 5.03. _No Solicitation by Deltic; Deltic Board Recommendation_. (a)
Deltic shall, and shall instruct its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Deltic Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Deltic Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished to any such Person or its Representatives in connection with any
potential Deltic Takeover Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and

 



56  electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article 8, Deltic shall not, nor shall it authorize any of its Affiliates
or any of its or their respective Representatives to, (i) directly or
indirectly solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any Deltic
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Deltic Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any information with respect
to, or cooperate in any way with any Person who has made or, to Deltics
Knowledge, is seeking to make, a Deltic Takeover Proposal with respect to any
Deltic Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Deltic Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Deltic Stockholder Approval, in
response to a bona fide written Deltic Takeover Proposal that the Deltic Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Deltic Proposal, and which Deltic
Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of this
Section 5.03(a), Deltic may (and may authorize the Deltic Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section
5.03(c), (x) furnish information with respect to Deltic and the Deltic
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Deltic Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) _(provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to Potlatch or is provided to Potlatch prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person than
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement
shall not be required to contain standstill provisions (a "Deltic Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement") and (y) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such Deltic Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with,
and only with, the Person making such Deltic Takeover Proposal (and such
Persons Representatives).Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03(a) by
(x) any controlled Affiliate of Deltic or (y) any other Affiliates of Deltic
or any of its or their Representatives which violation was known by Deltic
(unless promptly after Deltic knew of such violation it took all reasonable
actions to cause such violation to cease), in each case shall constitute a
breach of this Section 5.03(a) by Deltic. If Deltic or any of its
Representatives receives any inquiry from any Person regarding a Deltic
Takeover Proposal, nothing herein shall prohibit Deltic from directing such
Person to this Section 5.03(a).

 

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Deltic Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Potlatch),
or propose publicly to withdraw (or to modify in any manner adverse to
Potlatch), the Deltic Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any Deltic Takeover Proposal or (ii) approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or allow Deltic or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into,
any Acquisition Agreement (other than a Deltic Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) constituting or relating to, or that is intended to or would

 



57  reasonably be expected to lead to, any Deltic Takeover Proposal, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Deltic to abandon, terminate,
delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise prevent or materially
impede, interfere with or delay the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any action in clause (i) or
clause (ii) (other than Deltic or any Deltic Affiliate executing or entering
into any Acquisition Agreement (other than a Deltic Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement)) being referred to as a "Deltic Adverse Recommendation Change").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Deltic
Stockholder Approval, the Deltic Board may make a Deltic Adverse
Recommendation Change if (i) Deltic receives a Superior Deltic Proposal or
(ii) a Deltic Intervening Event occurs and, in each case, the Deltic
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Deltic shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to make a Deltic Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a
Deltic Takeover Proposal or a Superior Deltic Proposal or a Deltic Intervening
Event until after the fifth Business Day following Potlatchs receipt of
written notice (a "Deltic Notice of Recommendation Change") from Deltic
advising Potlatch that the Deltic Board intends to take such action, including
the terms and conditions of any Deltic Takeover Proposal or Superior Deltic
Proposal or the nature of the Deltic Intervening Event that is the basis of
the proposed action by the Deltic Board (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any material change to any material
term of such Deltic Takeover Proposal or Superior Deltic Proposal shall
require a new Deltic Notice of Recommendation Change, except that references
to the five Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to
a two Business Day period). In determining whether to make a Deltic Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Deltic Board shall take into account any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Potlatch in response to a Deltic
Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Deltic set forth in Sections 5.03(a) and
5.03(b), Deltic shall promptly (and in any event within one Business Day of
receipt thereof by Deltic) advise Potlatch in writing of any Deltic Takeover
Proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Deltic Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Deltic Takeover
Proposal (including any material changes thereto) and the identity of the
Person making any such Deltic Takeover Proposal. Deltic shall (i) keep
Potlatch informed in all material respects of the status and
details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any Deltic
Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to Potlatch as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all written and
electronic materials that describe any Deltic Takeover Proposal and any
material amendments thereto exchanged between Deltic or any of the Deltic
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives and any other Person who
describes any of the terms or conditions of any Deltic Takeover Proposal.

(d) At any time prior to obtaining the Deltic Stockholder Approval, provided
that Deltic and its Affiliates have complied in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of this Section 5.03, the Deltic Board may,
concurrently with making a Deltic Adverse Recommendation Change, cause Deltic
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) (including payment of
the Deltic Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a binding definitive
agreement providing for such Superior Deltic Proposal.

 



58 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit Deltic from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or issuing a "stop-look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Deltic if, in the good faith judgment of the Deltic Board
(after consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

"Deltic Intervening Event" means any event, change, effect, development or
occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this Agreement that
materially affects the business, assets or operations of Deltic or Potlatch
(provided that, in the case of a Deltic Intervening Event that relates to any
event, change, effect, development or occurrence that materially affect the
business, assets or operations of Potlatch rather than the business, assets or
operations of Deltic, the Deltic Board must have concluded in good faith that
such Deltic Intervening Event has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Potlatch Material Adverse Effect) and that (i) was not known, or reasonably
foreseeable, to the Board of Directors of Deltic as of or prior to the date of
this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this Agreement by
Deltic and (ii) does not relate to or involve a Superior Deltic Proposal or
Deltic Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , however, that no such event, change,
effect, development or occurrence shall be taken into account in determining
whether a Deltic Intervening Event has occurred or arisen to the extent that
it results from or arises out of: (i) changes or conditions generally
affecting any of the industries in which Deltic or Potlatch operates, (ii)
general economic or political conditions within the region of the United
States in which Deltic or Potlatch has operations; (iii) any change in
applicable Law or GAAP (or authoritative interpretation of Law or GAAP); (iv)
any failure, in and of itself, by Potlatch to meet any internal or published
projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (it being
understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing
to such failure may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or will be a Deltic Intervening Event
unless otherwise excluded in this definition of "Deltic Intervening Event");
(v) any occurrence, in and of itself, in which Deltic exceeds any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of
revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period (it
being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing
to such exceedance may be deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or will be, a Deltic Intervening Event
unless otherwise excluded in this definition of "Deltic Intervening Event");
(vi) compliance by Deltic or Potlatch with or performance by Deltic or
Potlatch under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; or
(vii) any change, in and of itself, in the market price or trading value of
Deltic Common Stock or Potlatch Common Stock (it being understood that the
facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such change may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been or will be a Deltic Intervening Event

 



59  unless otherwise excluded in this definition of "Deltic Intervening Event")
(except, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) to the extent such change
or condition has a materially disproportionate effect on Deltic and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Potlatch and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as applicable, relative to others in the industries in which Deltic and
its Subsidiaries or Potlatch and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, operate).

"Deltic Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (whether or not
in writing) made by any Person or Persons other than Potlatch or any of its
Affiliates, with respect to any (i) sale, lease, contribution or other
disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, recapitalization,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, a Deltic Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business
or assets of Deltic or the Deltic Subsidiaries representing 25% or more of
the consolidated revenues, consolidated net income or consolidated assets of
Deltic and the Deltic Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for or representing 25% or more of the total
outstanding voting power of Deltic, (ii) transaction in which any Person (or
the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or
formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 25% or more of the total outstanding voting power of
Deltic or (iii) combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the
Merger).

 

"Superior Deltic Proposal" means any binding bona fide written offer that did
not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of
Section 5.03(a) made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third
party (or in a merger or consolidation involving such party, the stockholders
of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more
than 50% of the Deltic Common Stock or all or substantially all of the assets
of Deltic and the Deltic Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which
the Deltic Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor) to be more favorable from a financial point
of view to the holders of Deltic Common Stock than the Merger, taking into
account all the material terms and conditions of such offer (including the
material legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal) and of this
Agreement (including any changes proposed by Potlatch to the terms of this
Agreement) and (ii) that the Deltic Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor) is otherwise
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed taking into
account all material legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal.

Potlatch Stockholders Meeting and Deltic Stockholders Meeting._

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and no
later than 45 days following the date of this Agreement (or such other date
as is mutually agreed by Potlatch and Deltic), Potlatch and Deltic shall
jointly prepare and cause to be

 



60  filed with the SEC a joint proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of
Potlatch relating to the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting and to the stockholders
of Deltic relating to the Deltic Stockholders Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Joint Proxy Statement") and Potlatch
shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Form S-4, in which
the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and Potlatch and
Deltic shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing. Each of Potlatch and Deltic shall furnish all information
concerning itself and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy
Statement, and the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement shall include all
information reasonably requested by such other party to be included therein.
Each of Potlatch and Deltic shall, promptly following receipt thereof, provide
the other party with copies of any written comments and advise the other party
of any oral comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement and shall provide the
other with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of Potlatch and Deltic
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of Potlatch and Deltic (i) shall provide the other
an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including
the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) shall include
in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other and
(iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to
receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of Potlatch and Deltic shall advise the
other, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness
of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the
suspension of the qualification of the Merger Consideration for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, and each of Potlatch and Deltic shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of Potlatch and Deltic shall also take
any other action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws in connection with the Merger and the issuance of the Merger
Consideration.

 

(b) If, to the Knowledge of Potlatch, prior to the Effective Time, any event
occurs with respect to Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary, or any change
occurs, or inaccuracy is discovered, with respect to information supplied by
Potlatch for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, which is
required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, Potlatch shall promptly notify Deltic of such
event, and Potlatch and Deltic shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the
SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4 and, as required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to Potlatchs stockholders and
Deltics stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(b) shall limit the
obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).

 



61 (c) If, to the Knowledge of Deltic, prior to the Effective Time, any event
occurs with respect to Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary, or any change occurs,
or inaccuracy is discovered, with respect to information supplied by Deltic
for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, which is
required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Joint
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, Deltic shall promptly notify Potlatch of such
event, and Potlatch and Deltic shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the
SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4 and, as required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to Potlatchs stockholders and
Deltics stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(c) shall limit the
obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).

 

(d) Potlatch shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking the
Potlatch Stockholder Approval. Potlatch shall use its reasonable best efforts
(x) to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Potlatchs
stockholders and (y) to hold the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
in each case in accordance with applicable Law, the Potlatch Charter and the
Potlatch By-laws. Unless the Potlatch Board has made a Potlatch Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.02(b), Potlatch shall, through
the Potlatch Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Potlatch
Stockholder Approval, shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement and shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Potlatch
Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly contemplated by the immediately
preceding sentence or Section 5.02, Potlatch agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Potlatch of any
Potlatch Takeover Proposal or by the making of any Potlatch Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Potlatch Board. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if Potlatch reasonably believes, after
consulting with its outside counsel and Deltic, that (i) it is necessary to
postpone or adjourn the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to
the stockholders of Potlatch within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting or (ii) (A) it will not receive proxies
sufficient to obtain the Potlatch Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, or (B) it will not have sufficient Potlatch Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting, then Potlatch,
after consultation with Deltic, may postpone or adjourn, or make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of, the Potlatch Stockholders
Meeting, as long as, in the case of any postponement or adjournment under
clause (ii) of this sentence, the date of the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 15 calendar days. In the
event that during the five Business Days prior to the date that the Potlatch
Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, Potlatch delivers a notice
of an intent to make a Potlatch Adverse Recommendation Change, Deltic may
direct Potlatch to postpone the Potlatch

 



62  Stockholders Meeting for up to six Business Days and Potlatch shall
promptly, and in any event no later than the next Business Day, postpone the
Potlatch Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Deltics direction, subject
to Potlatchs right to postpone the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting for a longer
period pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(e) Deltic shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Deltic Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Deltic Stockholder
Approval. Deltic shall use its reasonable best efforts (x) to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement to be mailed to Deltics stockholders and (y) to hold the
Deltic Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with
applicable Law, the Deltic Charter and the Deltic Bylaws. Unless the Deltic
Board has made a Deltic Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section
5.03(b), Deltic shall, through the Deltic Board, recommend to its stockholders
that they give the Deltic Stockholder Approval, shall include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and shall use reasonable best
efforts to solicit the Deltic Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence or Section 5.03, Deltic
agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Deltic of any Deltic Takeover Proposal or by the making of
any Deltic Adverse Recommendation Change by the Deltic Board. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if Deltic reasonably
believes, after consulting with its outside counsel and Potlatch, that (i) it
is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Deltic Stockholders Meeting to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is
provided to the stockholders of Deltic within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Deltic Stockholders Meeting or (ii) (A) it will not receive
proxies sufficient to obtain the Deltic Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, or (B) it will not have sufficient shares of Deltic Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Deltic Stockholders Meeting, then
Deltic, after consultation with Potlatch, may postpone or adjourn, or make one
or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Deltic Stockholders
Meeting, as long as, in the case of any postponement or adjournment under
clause (ii) of this sentence, the date of the Deltic Stockholders Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 15 calendar days. In the
event that during the five Business Days prior to the date that the Deltic
Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, Deltic delivers a notice of
an intent to make a Deltic Adverse Recommendation Change, Potlatch may direct
Deltic to postpone the Deltic Stockholders Meeting for up to six Business
Days and Deltic shall promptly, and in any event no later than the next
Business Day, postpone the Deltic Stockholders Meeting in accordance with
Potlatchs direction, subject to Deltics right to postpone the Deltic
Stockholders Meeting for a longer period pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence.

(f) Each of Potlatch and Deltic shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold
the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting and the Deltic Stockholders Meeting,
respectively, at the same time and on the same date as the other party.

 



63 Section 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, each of Potlatch and Deltic shall, and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other parties and to the
Representatives of such other parties reasonable access, during business hours
and during the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01,
to all their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and records (provided that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with
the providing partys business or operations) and, during such period, each of
Potlatch and Deltic shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries
to, furnish promptly to the other parties (a) to the extent not publicly
available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
securities Laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as either such other party may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that both Potlatch and Deltic may withhold
any document or information (i) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party ( _provided_ that the
withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (ii) subject to any
attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much
of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-
client privilege), (iii) personnel records that, in its good faith opinion,
could subject it to risk of liability or (iv) if, in the reasonable judgment
of such party, the sharing of such document or information violates applicable
Law. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject
to the mutual confidentiality agreement dated April 5, 2017 between Potlatch
and Deltic (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 

Section 6.03. _Required Actions._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably possible, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining
all necessary Governmental Entity and third party consents, approvals and
authorizations.

 

(b) Without limiting Section 6.03(a), Potlatch and the Potlatch Board and
Deltic and the Deltic Board, as the case may be, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action reasonably appropriate to
ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all
action reasonably appropriate to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 



64 (c) Should Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary own shares of Deltic Common
Stock entitled to vote at the Deltic Stockholders Meeting, Potlatch shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, vote all such shares of Deltic Common
Stock in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Potlatch and
Deltic shall:

 

(i) make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other

event within 20 days of this Agreement, an appropriate filing of a

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) as promptly as practical
after the date of this Agreement, all necessary registrations, declarations,
notices, applications and filings relating to the Merger with applicable
Governmental Entities under any applicable antitrust, competition, foreign

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other all assistance,
cooperation and information required for any such registration, declaration,
notice, application or filing and in order to achieve the effects set forth in
Section 6.03(d);

 

(iii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such registration,
declaration, notice, application or filing and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the
Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in this
Section 6.03(d)), and permit the other to review and discuss in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the
other in connection with any such registration, declaration, notice, filing,
application or communication;

 

(iv) use its reasonable best efforts to respond (including by providing any
requested information or documentation reasonably available) as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from any
Governmental Entity or any other authority enforcing applicable antitrust,
competition, foreign investment, trade regulation or similar Laws
for information or documentation in connection with antitrust, competition,
foreign investment, trade regulation or similar matters and not enter into any
agreement with such Governmental Entities or other authorities not to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but
subject to Section 6.03(e);

(v) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend
any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental

articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests
or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E) furnish the other

(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entitys staff, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger; and

(vi) use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would prevent,
restrain or delay the Closing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 6.03 and Section 6.09 shall not be construed to
(i) require Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary or Deltic or any Deltic
Subsidiary or (ii) permit Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary without the prior
written consent of Potlatch, to undertake any efforts or to take any action
if the taking of all such efforts or action, in the aggregate, would or would
reasonably be expected to result (after giving effect to any reasonably
expected proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets) in a Regulatory
Material Adverse Effect. "Regulatory Material Adverse Effect" means any fact,
circumstance, effect, change, event or development that has a material adverse
effect on the business, properties, financial condition or results of
operations of the Combined Company.

Section 6.04. _Equity Awards._

 

(a) Each Deltic Stock Option Award that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and
without any required action on the part of Deltic or any holder of any such
Deltic Stock Option Award, vest in full and shall be converted into an option,
on the same terms and conditions (other than vesting) as were applicable
under such Deltic Stock Option Award, to acquire a number of shares of
Potlatch Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (x) the number of shares of Deltic Common Stock subject to the
Deltic Stock Option Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Deltic Common Stock
of such Deltic Stock Option Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that in the case of any Deltic
Stock Option Award to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise
price and the number of shares of Potlatch Common Stock purchasable pursuant
to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject
to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code.

 



66 (b) Each Share of Deltic Common Stock underlying each Deltic Equity Award that
is a Deltic Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and
without any required action on the part of Deltic or any holder of any such
Deltic Restricted Stock Award, vest in full, and the restrictions and
forfeiture conditions with respect thereto shall lapse and expire, and each
share of Deltic Common Stock underlying such Deltic Restricted Stock Award
shall be converted into shares of Potlatch Common Stock in accordance with
Section 2.01(b); _provided_ , that any Deltic Restricted Stock Awards that are
granted between the date hereof and the Closing Date shall not vest
immediately prior to the Effective Time and instead will be converted
into shares of Potlatch Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.01(b)
("Converted Deltic Restricted Stock Awards") and will continue to be subject
to the same restrictions, vesting and forfeiture conditions, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, that any such Converted Deltic Restricted Stock
Awards shall vest in full if the employment of the holder of any such
Converted Deltic Restricted Stock Award is terminated without "cause" or for
"good reason" following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Deltic Restricted Stock Awards held by any non-employee director of Deltic who
will become a director of Potlatch effective as of the Closing Date may be
converted into restricted stock awards of Potlatch as provided in Section
5.01(b)(iv) of the Deltic Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) Each share of Deltic Common Stock underlying each Deltic Equity Award that
is a Deltic Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of
the Closing and without any required action on the part of Deltic or any
holder of any such Deltic Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award, be deemed
to have been achieved at the maximum level and, accordingly, shall vest in
full at 200% of target. Each share of Deltic Common Stock underlying any
Deltic Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award that vests in accordance with
this Section 6.04(c), shall be converted into shares of Potlatch Common Stock
in accordance with Section 2.01(b).

(d) All adjustments to Deltic Stock Option Awards pursuant to this Section
6.04 shall be in accordance with, and no amounts shall be payable with respect
thereto, as applicable, prior to the time permissible under, the requirements
under Section 409A of the Code. All rounding described in this Section 6.04
shall be done on an aggregate basis per Deltic Stock Option Award and any
holder of a Deltic Stock Option Award the adjustment of which results in
fractional shares shall be entitled to a cash payment as provided under
Section 2.02(f) of this Agreement in respect of such fractional share.

(e) At the Effective Time, Potlatch shall assume all the obligations of
Deltic under the Deltic Stock Plan and each Deltic Stock Option Award and
Converted Deltic Restricted Stock Award outstanding at the Effective Time and
the agreements evidencing the grants thereof, in each case, subject to the
adjustments in this Section 6.04. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Potlatch shall deliver to the holders of Deltic Stock Option Awards and
Converted Deltic Restricted Stock Awards appropriate notices 

 



67  setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the Deltic Stock Plan, and
the agreements evidencing the grants of such Deltic Stock Option Awards and
Converted Deltic Restricted Stock Awards and such Deltic Stock Option Awards
and Converted Deltic Restricted Stock Awards shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
6.04 after giving effect to the Merger).

 

(f) Potlatch shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Potlatch Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Deltic Stock Option Awards assumed in accordance with this
Section 6.04. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Potlatch shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Potlatch Common Stock
subject to the Deltic Stock Option Awards and Converted Deltic Restricted
Stock Awards and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein), and to maintain an optionholder broker-assisted cashless exercise
program for the Deltic Stock Option Awards, for so long as such Deltic Stock
Option Awards remain outstanding.

(g) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Deltic shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, no Deltic
Personnel or any other current or former participant in the Deltic Stock Plan,
any Deltic Benefit Plan or any Deltic Benefit Agreement shall have any right
thereunder to acquire any capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, Potlatch, Deltic or their respective Subsidiaries, except
for the right of any holder of Deltic Stock Option Awards, to receive shares
of Potlatch Common Stock upon exercise thereof in accordance with Section
6.04(a).

 

Section 6.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Potlatch shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law (including to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any amendments to applicable Law adopted after the
date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may
indemnify its officers and directors) (and shall promptly advance expenses
actually and reasonably incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law (including to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
amendments to applicable Law adopted after the date of this Agreement that
increase the extent to which a corporation may advance expenses to its
officers and directors)) each former and present director or officer of Deltic
or any Deltic Subsidiary, as the case may be (the "Deltic Indemnified
Parties"), if such Deltic Indemnified Party is or was a party or is threatened
to be made a party, to any actual or threatened suit, action or other
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, with
respect to matters existing or occurring, or acts or omissions occurring, at
or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and the approval of any of
the foregoing), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including

 



68  attorneys fees and disbursements, actually incurred by the Deltic
Indemnifying Party in connection with such suit, action or other proceeding,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising
out of or pertaining to the fact that the Deltic Indemnified Party is or was
an officer or director of Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary or is or was serving
at the request of Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary as a director or officer of
another Person. Any indemnification or other similar agreements of Deltic or
any Deltic Subsidiary, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, a true and complete copy of which has been made available to
Potlatch prior to the date of this Agreement, shall be assumed by Potlatch in
the Merger, without further action as of the Effective Time, and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For the
avoidance of doubt, the indemnification provided for by this Section 6.05(a)
shall not apply to any Deltic Indemnified Party who becomes a director of or
remains an employee of the Combined Company after the Closing, in each case,
to the extent relating to suits, actions or other proceedings to the extent
relating to acts or omissions occurring after the Effective Time; it being
understood that such matters will be subject to the indemnification
arrangements the Combined Company has in place after the Effective Time that
are applicable to similarly situated individuals.

(b) In the event that Potlatch or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, in each case Potlatch shall cause proper provision to be
made so that the successors and assigns of Potlatch assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.05 contemporaneous with the closing of any such
consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance.

(c) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, Potlatch will purchase and provide directors and officers
liability insurance from an insurance carrier or carriers with the same or
better credit rating as Deltics current insurance carriers with respect to
such directors and officers insurance that serves to reimburse the present
and former officers and directors of Deltic or any of its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time, which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less favorable to the Deltic
Indemnified Parties as the coverage currently provided by Deltics current
insurance carriers; provided, that in no event shall Potlatch be required to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof by Deltic for such insurance (the "Premium Cap");
provided, __ further, that if any such annual expense at any time would exceed
the Premium Cap, then Potlatch will cause to be maintained policies of
insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. At the option of Deltic (subject to the proviso
below), or if requested by Potlatch, prior to the Effective Time and in lieu
of the foregoing, Deltic may (and Deltic shall, if requested by Potlatch and
if such policy is available), purchase a tail policy for directors and
officers liability insurance on the terms described in the prior sentence
(including subject to the aggregate Premium Cap for the six-year period) and
fully pay for such policy prior to the Effective Time, in which event
Potlatchs obligations under this

 



69  Section 6.05(c) shall be fully satisfied; _provided_ that Deltic may not
exercise its option to purchase such tail policy if, after providing written
notice to Potlatch of its intention to do so, Potlatch agrees to purchase
such tail policy and does so purchase such tail policy prior to Closing.
References in this Section 6.05(c) to the coverage currently provided by
Deltics current insurance carriers shall also include the employment
practices liability and fiduciary liability coverages provided by Deltics
current insurance carriers.

(d) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the
Deltic Charter or Deltic Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were Deltic Indemnified Parties, unless such modification
shall be required by Law and then only to the extent required by Law.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each Deltic Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his and her
representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that each Deltic Indemnified
Party may have by contract or otherwise, including under the terms of the
respective charters or bylaws or comparable organizational documents of Deltic
and the Deltic Subsidiaries.

 

(f) If any Deltic Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.05 that is denied by Potlatch
and/or the Surviving Company, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines
that the Deltic Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or
advancement of expense, in whole or in part, then Potlatch or the Surviving
Company shall pay such Deltic Indemnified Partys reasonable costs and
expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with
pursuing such claim against Potlatch and/or the Surviving Company.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Deltic or any of its respective subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
directors, officers or other employees.

 

Section 6.06. _Fees and Expenses._

 

(a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
such transactions are consummated.

 



70 (b) Deltic shall pay to Potlatch a fee of $33,000,000 (the "Deltic
Termination Fee") if:

a result of a material breach of Section 5.03 or (y) Section 8.01(e) or (B)
either Potlatch or Deltic terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(iv), in either case, at any time at or after which
Potlatch would have been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(c) as a result of a material breach of Section 5.03 or pursuant
to Section 8.01(e);

 

(ii) (A) prior to the Deltic Stockholders Meeting, a Deltic Takeover Proposal
is made to Deltic or is made directly to the stockholders of Deltic generally
or otherwise becomes publicly known or any Person has publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Deltic Takeover Proposal and,
in any such case, such Deltic Takeover Proposal or intention has not been
withdrawn prior to the Deltic Stockholders Meeting, (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by Deltic or Potlatch pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i)
(if the Deltic Stockholders Meeting has not been held) or by Deltic
or Potlatch pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iv) and (C) within 12 months of such
termination, Deltic either enters into a definitive Contract to consummate a
Deltic Takeover Proposal which is later consummated or a Deltic Takeover
Proposal is consummated. For the purposes of Section 6.06(b)(ii)(C) only, the
term "Deltic Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 5.03(f) except that all references to "25%" therein shall
be deemed to be references to "50%"; or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Deltic pursuant to Section 8.01(h).

Any Deltic Termination Fee due under this Section 6.06(b) shall be paid by
wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the
second Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this
Agreement, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, on the second Business Day
following the consummation of such Deltic Takeover Proposal and (z) in the
case of clause (iii) above, on the date of termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) Potlatch shall pay to Deltic a fee of $66,000,000 (the "Potlatch
Termination Fee") if:

 

(i) (A) Deltic terminates this Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 8.01(d) as a
result of a material breach of Section 5.02 or (y) Section 8.01(f) or (B)
either Potlatch or Deltic terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(iii), in either case, at any time at or after which
Deltic would have been permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d) as a result of a material breach of Section 5.02 or pursuant
to Section 8.01(f);

 



71 (ii) (A) prior to the Potlatch Stockholders Meeting, a Potlatch
Takeover Proposal is made to Potlatch or is made directly to the stockholders
of Potlatch generally or otherwise becomes publicly known or any Person has
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a
Potlatch Takeover Proposal and, in any such case, such Potlatch Takeover

Stockholders Meeting, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Potlatch
or Deltic pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (if the Potlatch Stockholders
Meeting has not been held) or by Potlatch or Deltic pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months of such termination, Potlatch either
enters into a definitive Contract to consummate a Potlatch Takeover Proposal
which is later consummated or a Potlatch Takeover Proposal is consummated. For
the purposes of Section 6.06(c)(ii)(C) only, the term "Potlatch Takeover
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.02(f)
except that all references to "25%" therein shall be deemed to be references
to "50%"; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Potlatch pursuant to Section 8.01(g).

case of clause (iii) above, on the date of termination of this Agreement.

 

(d) Potlatch and Deltic acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
Sections 6.06(b) and 6.06(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
Deltic nor Potlatch would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Potlatch
fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(c) or
Deltic fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(b) (but
subject to Section 6.06(e)), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Person
owed such payment commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results in
a judgment in its favor for such payment, the Person owing such payment shall
pay to the Person owed such payment its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, action
or other proceeding, together with interest on the amount of such payment
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime rate as published by _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made. In no event shall either Potlatch
or Deltic be obligated to pay more than one termination fee pursuant to this
Section 6.06. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
the event that the Potlatch Termination Fee or the Deltic Termination Fee is
payable and actually paid to Potlatch or Deltic in accordance with this
Section 6.06 (or is paid into escrow in accordance with Section 6.06(e)), such
Potlatch Termination Fee or Deltic Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party and its Affiliates
against any other party or such other partys Affiliates and other
Representatives, for any loss or damage based upon, arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



72 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 6.06(e) shall apply with respect to the payment of
the Deltic Termination Fee required to be made hereunder:

 

(i) If Deltic is required to pay Potlatch the Deltic Termination Fee (the
"Deltic Termination Payment") such Deltic Termination Payment shall be paid
into escrow on the date such Deltic Termination Payment is required to be paid
by Deltic pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of same-day funds to an
escrow account in accordance with Section 6.06(e)(ii). In the event that
Deltic is obligated to pay Potlatch the Deltic Termination Payment, the amount
payable to Potlatch in any tax year of Potlatch shall not exceed the lesser of
(A) the Deltic Termination Payment payable to Potlatch (less any amount
previously paid in respect thereof) and (B) the sum of (1) the maximum amount
that can be paid to Potlatch without causing Potlatch to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code for the relevant
tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Section 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code ("Qualifying
Income") and Potlatch has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during
such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as
determined by Potlatchs independent accountants, plus (2) in the event
Potlatch receives either (x) a letter from Potlatchs counsel indicating that
Potlatch has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this Section
6.06(e) or (y) an opinion from Potlatchs outside counsel as described below
in this Section 6.06(e), an amount equal to the excess of the Deltic
Termination Payment (less any amount previously paid in respect thereof) less
the amount payable under clause (1) above.

 

(ii) To secure Deltics obligation to pay these amounts, Deltic shall deposit
into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Deltic Termination Payment with a
nationally recognized escrow agent selected by Deltic on such terms (subject
to this Section 6.06(e)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by Deltic, Potlatch
and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Deltic
Termination Payment pursuant to this Section 6.06(e) shall be made at the time
Deltic is obligated to pay Potlatch such amount pursuant to Section 6.06 by
wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Deltic Termination
Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Potlatch
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A)
a letter from Potlatchs independent accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Potlatch without causing
Potlatch to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
856(c)(2)(3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute Qualifying Income and Potlatch has $1,000,000 of income from
unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition
to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which
case the escrow agent shall release such 

 



73  amount to Potlatch, or (B) a letter from Potlatchs counsel indicating that
(1) Potlatch received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by
Potlatch of the Deltic Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c) (2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (2) Potlatchs outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Potlatch of the
Deltic Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and 856(c)(3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Deltic Termination Payment to Potlatch. Deltic agrees to
amend this Section 6.06(e) at the reasonable request of Potlatch in order to
(x) maximize the portion of the Deltic Termination Payment that may be
distributed to Potlatch hereunder without causing Potlatch to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or (y) assist
Potlatch in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its outside
counsel, in each case, as described in this Section 6.06(e), provided that
Deltic shall not be required to take any action that is prejudicial to it. Any
amount of the Deltic Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of
a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 6.06(e); provided,
however, that any amount that has not been released from the escrow to
Potlatch pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.06(e) as of the fifth
anniversary of the deposit into such escrow shall at that time be released to
Deltic, and Deltic shall have no further obligations to Potlatch with respect
thereto.

 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, if Deltic makes the payment of the Deltic
Termination Fee to the escrow agent as set forth in clause (ii) above it will
have no further obligation to make any payment in respect of the Deltic
Termination Fee (other than from the escrow account) and the Deltic
Termination Fee will be deemed to have been paid for the purposes of the
last sentence of Section 6.06(d).

Section 6.07. _Certain Tax Matters._

 

(a) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, (ii) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement will constitute a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361, and 368 of the
Code, (iii) with respect to the Merger, Potlatch and Deltic will each be a
party to the reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code
and (iv) that Potlatch will maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT
following the Merger (the qualifications and other matters referred to in
clause (iv), the "Intended Potlatch REIT Treatment," and clauses (i) through
(iv), collectively, the "Intended Tax Treatment"). The parties shall cooperate
with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Intended
Tax Treatment to be obtained, including by (A) taking any action, or
refraining from any action that such party knows is reasonably likely to
prevent the Intended Tax Treatment, (B) subject to Section 6.07(b), engaging
in any pre-Closing internal restructuring transactions reasonably requested by
Potlatch, based on the advice of its counsel, for purposes of permitting 

 



74  Potlatch to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT following the
Merger, and providing any access or information reasonably requested by
Potlatch to identify what pre-Closing or post-Closing restructuring or
integration transactions are appropriate for such purpose (C) executing such
amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in order to obtain
the Intended Tax Treatment (it being understood that no party will be
required to agree to any such amendment or engage in any restructuring
transaction described in clause (B) that it determines in good faith
materially adversely affects its rights or obligations or the value of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to such party
or its stockholders, as applicable) and (D) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain the opinions referred to in Sections 7.02(d), 7.02(e), 7.03(d) and
7.03(e), including by executing customary letters of representation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Deltic shall have no responsibility under this
Agreement with respect to the "Intended Potlatch REIT Treatment", except to
the extent that Deltic has Knowledge that (i) the Intended Potlatch REIT
Treatment cannot be obtained but for the taking of any action, or refraining
from any action, by Deltic or (ii) the taking of an action or refraining from
an action would facilitate the Intended Potlatch REIT Treatment and is not
reasonably likely to impose on Deltic any material cost, liability or risk.
For the avoidance of doubt, Deltic shall not be required to set aside or pay
any dividend on, or make any other distribution (in cash or shares of Deltic
Common Stock, or any combination thereof) in respect of shares of Deltic
Common Stock) pursuant to this Section 6.07(a).

 

(b) From the date hereof until the implementation of the Final Deltic
Restructuring Plan (as defined below), Deltic shall keep Potlatch reasonably
apprised, no less often than every two weeks, as to the manner by which it
expects to implement the pre-Closing restructuring transactions to be
undertaken by Deltic and the Deltic Subsidiaries set forth on Section 6.07(b)
of the Deltic Disclosure Letter (the "Deltic Restructuring Plan") and Deltics
proposed Tax treatment thereof, and shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comments provided by Potlatch in connection therewith; provided
that, in the event that Potlatch and Deltic disagree on any such transaction,
Deltic shall make such determination in its reasonable discretion (for this
purpose, any position supported by "substantial authority" under Treas. Reg.
§ 1.6662-4(d) or any similar standard under applicable Law shall be considered
reasonable) unless Potlatch reasonably determines in good faith that such
transaction materially adversely affects its rights or obligations or the
value of the Merger to Potlatch, or the Intended Potlatch REIT Treatment). No
later than December 31, 2017, Deltic shall provide Potlatch with its final
Deltic Restructuring Plan (the "Final Deltic Restructuring Plan"). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.07(b) shall obligate Deltic or
the Deltic Subsidiaries to undertake any pre-Closing restructuring
transactions.

(c) (i) Deltic shall use reasonable best efforts to procure and deliver to
Potlatch as soon as reasonably practicable after January 1, 2018, a study of
KPMG LLP or another nationally recognized independent accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Potlatch, determining the dollar amount of any
accumulated "earnings and profits" for U.S. federal income tax purposes of
Deltic and each Deltic Subsidiary that is a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, in each case as of January 1, 2018 (the "EandP Study"), and
(ii) if, notwithstanding Deltics reasonable best efforts, the EandP

 



75  study has not been completed by the Closing Date, Deltic shall provide to
Potlatch within 10 days before the Closing Date its reasonable estimation
(after consultation with KPMG LLP or such other accounting firm that is
preparing the EandP study, as applicable) of any accumulated "earnings and
profits" for U.S. federal income tax purposes of Deltic and each Deltic
Subsidiary that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in
each case as of January 1, 2018. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of a
completed EandP Study referred to in clause (i) of the preceding sentence shall

_provided_ that such indemnity shall not, as to any indemnitee, be available
to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, obligations, costs and
expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such indemnitee or the material breach in bad faith by
any indemnitee of its contractual obligations to Potlatch.

(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding Deltic or
any Deltic Subsidiary obtained by Potlatch or any of its Affiliates or their

Section 6.16. _Coordination of Dividends._

 

(a) Potlatch and Deltic shall coordinate with each other to designate the same
record and payment dates for any quarterly dividends or distributions
declared in accordance with this Agreement in any calendar quarter in which

of shares of Potlatch Common Stock or shares of Deltic Common Stock
will receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any single
calendar quarter with respect to its shares of Potlatch Common Stock or its
shares of Deltic Common Stock, including shares of Potlatch Common Stock
issued in connection with the Merger, and (ii) the quarterly payments of
dividends to the holders of shares of Potlatch Common Stock (and any necessary
adjustments to Deltics schedule for the quarterly declaration of dividends
and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto) will be made
substantially in accordance with Potlatchs historical quarterly dividend
payment schedule.

(b) If Potlatch determines, after consultation with its nationally recognized
Tax counsel and with Deltic, that it is necessary to declare, set aside or pay
any dividend on, or make any other distribution (in cash or shares of Potlatch
Common Stock, or any combination thereof) in respect of shares of Potlatch
Common Stock in order to meet the distribution requirements set forth in
Section 857(a) of the Code and maintain its qualification as a REIT under the
Code or applicable state Law, to the extent in excess of the distributions
permitted by Section 5.01(a)(i)(A)(x) of this Agreement (any such excess
distribution, a "Special Distribution," and the per share amount of such
distribution, the "Special Distribution Per Share") it shall (i) notify
Deltic as promptly as practicable after such determination, and in any event
no less than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing, including the size and
character of such Special Distribution and the reasons therefor, (ii) to the
maximum extent practicable, make the Special Distribution in the form of
shares of Potlatch Common Stock and (iii) be entitled to declare and pay such
Special Distribution. If any Special Distribution (or portion thereof) has a
record date prior to the Effective Time and is in the form of shares of
Potlatch Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted as provided for in
Section 2.01(b). If any Special Distribution (or portion thereof) has a
record date prior to the Effective Time and is in the form of cash, then
Deltic shall be entitled to declare and pay a dividend to holders of shares of
Deltic Common Stock, in an amount per share of Deltic Common Stock equal to
(A) the Special Distribution Per Share declared by Potlatch with respect to
each share of Potlatch Common Stock multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

 

Section 6.17. _Employee Matters._

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December
31, 2018 (or such shorter period of employment, as the case may be) (the
"Continuation Period"), Potlatch shall provide each individual who is actively

 



79  employed by Deltic or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues employment during such period (each, a
"Deltic Employee") (i) base salary, base wage rate, annual incentive
opportunities and long-term incentive opportunities that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than the base salary, base wage rate, annual incentive
opportunities and such long-term incentive opportunities that were provided
to such Deltic Employee prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other benefits
(other than equity compensation and other long-term incentives, change in
control, retention, transition, stay or similar arrangements) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such other benefits that
were provided to such Deltic Employee under the Deltic Benefit Plans and
Deltic Benefit Agreements immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate and vesting
with respect to the benefit plans maintained by Potlatch or any Potlatch
Subsidiary (including the Potlatch 401(k) Plan) and (ii) level of benefits
under vacation and severance plans and arrangements (and not any other plans
or arrangements) maintained by Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary,
service with Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary (or any predecessor employer of
an employee of Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary, to the extent service with
such predecessor employer is recognized by Deltic or the applicable Deltic
Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement) prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated as service with Potlatch or the Potlatch Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent (A) that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits,
(B) not recognized by Deltic or a Deltic Subsidiary, as applicable, for
similar purposes or (C) that such recognition would apply for the purpose of
any plan, program or arrangement under which similarly situated employees of
Potlatch and the Potlatch Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service
(including prior service with predecessor employers) or that is grandfathered
or frozen, either with respect to eligibility to participate, vesting or
level of benefits (including any pension, retiree health or other retiree
welfare benefits).

(c) During the Continuation Period, with respect to any Deltic Employee whose
employment is terminated by Potlatch or any Potlatch Subsidiary, Potlatch
shall provide, or shall cause such Potlatch Subsidiary to provide, severance
benefits to such Deltic Employee that are no less favorable than the
severance benefits paid by Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary, as applicable, in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and set forth on
Section 6.17(c) of the Deltic Disclosure Letter, taking into account
all service with Deltic, Potlatch or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
determining eligibility for severance benefits and the amount of severance
benefits payable.

 

(d) For purposes of each benefit plan of Potlatch or the Potlatch
Subsidiaries, Potlatch and the Potlatch Subsidiaries shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such plans to be waived for employees of
Deltic and the Deltic Subsidiaries and their covered dependents (other than
limitations, including pre-existing conditions exclusions, or waiting periods
that are already in effect with respect to such employees and dependents
under the benefit plans of Deltic and the Deltic Subsidiaries and that have
not been satisfied as of the date

 



80  such employees and dependents commence participation in such benefit plans
of Potlatch and the Potlatch Subsidiaries) and (ii) give full credit for
all co-payments and deductibles to the extent satisfied in the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs (or the year in which employees of Deltic and
the Deltic Subsidiaries and their dependents commence participation in the
benefit plans of Potlatch and the Potlatch Subsidiaries, if later) as if there
had been a single continuous employer if such co-payments and deductibles are
submitted to the administrator of the benefit plans of the Potlatch and the
Potlatch Subsidiaries within 90 days following the Effective Time, in each
case subject to obtaining any required consent by the insurance carrier or
claims administrator with respect to the applicable benefit plan, which such
consents shall be promptly requested by Potlatch.

(e) Potlatch hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control" of Deltic for purposes of any Deltic Benefit Plan or Deltic Benefit
Agreement that contains a definition of "change in control" or "change of
control," as applicable.

(f) This Section 6.17 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
6.17, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer upon any other person
(including any current or former directors, officers, consultants or employees
of any of Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary or, on or after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries) any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever, (ii) is intended to be, shall constitute or be
construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Potlatch, Deltic, the Surviving
Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof or (iii) obligates Potlatch
or any of the Potlatch Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any
particular employee of Deltic or any Deltic Subsidiary following the Effective
Time.

stockholders of Potlatch without the further approval of such stockholders and
(b) after receipt of the Deltic Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of Deltic
without the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.

on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 shall, in order to be effective,

an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. References to actions "in the
ordinary course of business" shall be deemed to be references to "in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business" whether they include
the words "in all material respects" or not. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation". Any reference herein to any
statute shall also be deemed to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. The words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby", "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
Any reference herein or in the Deltic Disclosure Letter to documents having
been furnished, provided, delivered, made available or disclosed to Potlatch,
Merger Sub or their respective Representatives, or words of similar import,
shall be deemed to refer to such documents as were made available and
accessible to Potlatch and Potlatchs Representatives for their review by
posting to the electronic data rooms titled "Alpine" and "Golden Gate" hosted
by Merrill Corporation on or before 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) as of the
day immediately prior to the date hereof. Any reference herein or in the
Potlatch Disclosure Letter to documents having been furnished, provided,
delivered, made available or disclosed to Deltic or its Representatives, or
words of similar import, shall be deemed to refer to such documents as were

Contract or Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract or Law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise

ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must
be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue
of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 9.05. _Disclosure Letters_. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of either the Deltic Disclosure Letter
or the Potlatch Disclosure Letter shall only be deemed to be an exception to

warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of such party
that are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that
reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably
apparent from the face of the disclosure. The mere inclusion of an item in
either the Deltic Disclosure Letter or the Potlatch Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a representation or warranty (or covenants as applicable) shall
not be

 



93  deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Deltic Material Adverse Effect or Potlatch
Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

Section 9.06. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or by
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this Section 9.06 with respect thereto. Upon any determination that any
term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.07. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

of the parties and delivered (including by facsimile or electronic image
scan) to the other parties.

Representations._

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 3,
Deltic acknowledges that none of Potlatch, the Potlatch Subsidiaries or any
other Person on behalf of Potlatch makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with the transactions contemplated by

any implied representations or warranties to Deltic with respect to (i)
Potlatch or the Potlatch Subsidiaries, their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,
plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the 

 



94  assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects) or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
Potlatch or the Potlatch Subsidiaries or (ii) any material, documents or
information relating to Potlatch or the Potlatch Subsidiaries furnished or
provided to Deltic or its Representatives or made available to Deltic or its
Representatives in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
this Agreement or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
except as expressly and specifically covered by a representation or warranty
set forth in Article 3. Deltic acknowledges that it is not executing or
authorizing the execution of this Agreement in reliance upon any such
representation or warranty not explicitly set forth in Article 3. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in Article 4, Potlatch and
Merger Sub acknowledge that none of Deltic, the Deltic Subsidiaries or any
other Person on behalf of Deltic makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Potlatch
and Merger Sub acknowledge that none of Deltic or the Deltic Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective Representatives or any other Person has made any
express or any implied representations or warranties to Potlatch with respect
to (i) Deltic or the Deltic Subsidiaries, their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
future operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts,
plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Deltic or the Deltic Subsidiaries
or (ii) any material, documents or information relating to Deltic or the
Deltic Subsidiaries furnished or provided to Potlatch or its Representatives
or made available to Potlatch or its Representatives in any "data rooms,"
"virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except as expressly and
specifically covered by a representation or warranty set forth in Article 4.
Potlatch and Merger Sub acknowledge that they are not executing or authorizing
the execution of this Agreement in reliance upon any such representation
or warranty not explicitly set forth in Article 4.

(c) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of the
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of Potlatchs fraudulent
misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation or any willful and material
breach of this Agreement by Potlatch or Merger Sub, damages to Deltic shall
not be limited to the reimbursement of expenses and out of pocket costs and
shall include, to the extent proven, the loss of the benefit of the bargain to
Deltic and Deltics stockholders, which shall be deemed in such event to be
damages of Deltic.

 



95 Section 9.09. _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND

OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF

Section 9.10. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without

preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 

Section 9.11. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction._

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 8, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in clause (i) of the first sentence of Section 9.11(b), without
proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.

(b) Each of the parties (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any federal court located in the
State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of

any Delaware state court or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware.

IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY (a) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR OTHER PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (b) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

BYLAWS AMENDMENT

First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Deltic Timber
Corporation

The Amended and Restated Bylaws of Deltic Timber Corporation (the "Bylaws")
are hereby amended, effective as of October 21, 2017, as set forth below.

Article V of the Bylaws is hereby amended by adding the following section:

Article V

 

General Provisions

 

Section 7\. _Forum for Adjudication of Disputes_. Unless the Corporation
consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (an "Alternative
Forum Consent"), the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other
employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations
stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any
provision of Delaware Law, the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations for any class or
series of preferred stock) or these bylaws, in each case, as amended from time
to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs
doctrine, shall be the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware; _provided_
, that, in the event that the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware lacks
subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and
exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or
federal court located within the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to
the courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named
as defendants. Any person or entity owning, purchasing or otherwise acquiring
any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to
have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 7\. If any
action the subject matter of which is within the scope of this Section 7 of
Article V is filed in a court other than the Court of Chancery in the State of
Delaware (or any other state or federal court located within the State of
Delaware, as applicable) (a "Foreign Action") by or in the name of any
stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or
such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware,
as applicable) in connection with any action brought in any such court to
enforce this Section 7 of Article V and (ii) having service of process made
upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholders
counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder. The existence of
any prior Alternative Forum Consent shall not act as a waiver of the
Corporations ongoing consent right as set forth above in this Section 7 of
Article V with respect to any current or future actions or claims. EXHIBIT B

 

GOVERNANCE MATTERS



   1. | _Name_  Potlatch shall cause itself to be renamed
"PotlatchDeltic Corporation". Its Nasdaq ticker symbol shall remain "PCH". 
---|--- 
 



   2. | _Offices_  The principal executive offices of PotlatchDeltic
shall be in Spokane, Washington. PotlatchDeltics Southern Operational
Headquarters shall be in El Dorado, Arkansas. The specifics of
the organizational structure and roles will be determined as part of the
process to merge and integrate the companies. It is anticipated that this will
result in approximately 23 or more positions located in El Dorado, Arkansas. 
---|--- 
 



   3. | _Executives_  Michael J. Covey shall remain the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of PotlatchDeltic at the Effective Time. John D. Enlow
will become Vice Chairman of PotlatchDeltic at the Effective Time pursuant to
a 2 year consulting contract. 
---|--- 



   4. | _Board of Directors_  Potlatch shall take all necessary action
to cause, effective at the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
PotlatchDeltic to consist of (i) the eight directors of Potlatch as of the
date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) four directors selected by Deltic, each
of whom shall be a director of Deltic as of the date of the Merger Agreement
(the directors designated pursuant to this clause (ii), the
"Deltic Directors"). The classes of the Board of Directors of PotlatchDeltic
will be adjusted so that two Deltic Directors will be in the 2018 class (the
"2018 Deltic Directors"), one Deltic Director will be in the 2019 class
and one Deltic Director will be in the 2020 class. Potlatch will cause the
2018 Deltic Directors to be renominated for election at the 2018 annual
meeting of stockholders for a three year term and will use reasonable best
efforts (including solicitation of proxies) to have the 2018 Deltic Directors
so reelected. The Deltic Directors will be third party beneficiaries of the
preceding sentence and acting by a majority of the Deltic Directors may
enforce Potlatchs obligations under such sentence. 
---|--- 



   5. | _Board Committees_  At the first Annual Meeting after the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors will meet to discuss and approve
changes to the composition and chair positions of the committees of the
Board of Directors with the intent that Deltic Directors will comprise
approximately one-third of each committee.
