AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (as hereinafter amended, modified or changed
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof, this "Agreement"),
dated as of August 21, 2017, is by and among Energy Future Holdings Corp., a
Texas corporation (the "Company"), Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("EFIH"), Sempra Energy, a
California corporation ("Parent"), and Power Play Merger Sub I, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, on April 29, 2014, the Company and certain entities in which it,
directly or indirectly, holds an equity interest, including TCEH and EFCH
(each as defined below) and their respective Subsidiaries (as defined below)
(collectively, the "Debtors") commenced voluntary cases under chapter 11 of
title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et seq. (as amended, the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"), which cases are currently pending before
the Honorable Christopher S. Sontchi and jointly administered for procedural
purposes only under Case No. 14-10979, and any proceedings relating thereto
(collectively, the "Chapter 11 Cases");

WHEREAS, the EFH Debtors and EFIH Debtors (as such terms are defined in the
Plan of Reorganization) (collectively, the "E-Side Debtors") continue to
operate their respective businesses as debtors-in-possession under Sections
1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code;

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, the E-Side Debtors, on the one hand, and
the TCEH Debtors (as such term is defined in the Plan of Reorganization) and
certain other Debtors, on the other, separated from common ownership under the
Company;

WHEREAS, subject to approval of this Agreement by the Bankruptcy Court, the
Company, EFIH, Parent and Merger Sub have determined to engage in a strategic
business combination as more fully set forth below;

WHEREAS, the E-Side Debtors will file a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, as
attached hereto as Exhibit A (as such plan may be further amended, modified or
changed from time to time in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof
and this Agreement, the "Plan of Reorganization");

WHEREAS, under the plan of reorganization approved by the Bankruptcy Court on
August 29, 2016 [D.I. 9421] (the "TCEH Plan"), on October 3, 2016, Texas
Competitive Electric Holdings Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and then a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company ("TCEH"),
and the other TCEH Debtors, together with certain other direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of the Company identified in the TCEH Plan, were restructured in
a transaction intended to qualify as a reorganization under Sections
368(a)(1)(G) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") through a taxable transfer of certain assets to a separate


 

---

|

1 

subsidiary of Reorganized TCEH (the "TCEH Preferred Stock Entity") in the TCEH
Preferred Stock Sale (as defined below) (the steps in this clause,
collectively, the "Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off");

WHEREAS, in connection with the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, TCEH formed a new
wholly-owned subsidiary, then-named TEX Energy LLC (n/k/a Vistra Energy Corp.)
("Reorganized TCEH" or "Vistra Energy"), that (a) was treated as disregarded
from the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the date on which
the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off was consummated (the "TCEH Effective Date") and
(b) was the "controlled corporation" in connection with the Reorganized TCEH
Spin-Off. TCEH New Holdco (as defined below) was treated as disregarded from
the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the TCEH Effective
Date, on which date certain assets of TCEH and the Company were transferred to
TCEH New Holdco in connection with the TCEH Preferred Stock Sale;

WHEREAS, on the TCEH Effective Date, all claims against the TCEH Debtors,
except for liabilities assumed by Reorganized TCEH or a subsidiary thereof
pursuant to the TCEH Plan, were cancelled in connection with the Reorganized
TCEH Spin-Off;

WHEREAS, (a) TCEH transferred all of TCEH's interests in its Subsidiaries
(excluding the stock of TCEH Finance, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TCEH
Finance")) to Reorganized TCEH (the "TCEH Contribution"); and (b) the EFH
Debtors transferred to Reorganized TCEH the equity interests in then-named EFH
Corporate Services Company ("EFH Corporate Services"), then-named EFH
Properties Company and the other Subsidiaries of EFH specified in the TCEH
Plan and the Separation Agreement, and also contributed certain other assets
and liabilities related to the TCEH Debtors' operations, all as provided in
the TCEH Plan and the Separation Agreement (such entities, together with TCEH
and Reorganized TCEH and their respective Subsidiaries, the "Spin-Off
Entities", and such contributions by the EFH Debtors, collectively, the "EFH
Contribution", and the EFH Contribution, together with the TCEH Contribution,
the "Reorganized TCEH Contributions"). In exchange for the Reorganized TCEH
Contributions, TCEH received (a) all of the equity interests of Reorganized
TCEH, (b) the net cash proceeds of the new Reorganized TCEH debt issued for
cash, (c) the right to receive payments under a tax receivables agreement, if
any (such agreement, the "TRA", and such rights, the "TRA Rights"), and (d)
the right to receive the net cash proceeds of the TCEH Preferred Stock Sale;

WHEREAS, immediately following the Reorganized TCEH Contribution but before
the Reorganized TCEH Conversion (defined below), (a) Reorganized TCEH
contributed the equity in certain of its subsidiaries (including one or more
entities contributed to Reorganized TCEH in the EFH Contribution) to an entity
formed before the TCEH Effective Date that elected to be treated as a
corporation immediately following the TCEH Contribution but before the
Reorganized TCEH Conversion ("TCEH New Holdco") in exchange for all of the
equity interests of TCEH New Holdco, including any common stock and preferred
stock issued by TCEH New Holdco; and (b) immediately thereafter, and pursuant
to a prearranged and binding agreement, Reorganized TCEH sold all of the
preferred stock of TCEH New Holdco authorized to be issued by TCEH New Holdco
to third party investors in exchange for cash, and Reorganized TCEH thereafter
distributed the cash consideration attributable thereto to TCEH (the "TCEH
Preferred Stock Sale");

WHEREAS, immediately after the TCEH Preferred Stock Sale, Reorganized TCEH
converted to a Delaware corporation pursuant to applicable Law (as defined
below) (the "Reorganized TCEH Conversion");

such conditions at the Closing). The date on which the Closing actually occurs
is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date." For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Business Day" shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday, or a day on which banks are
required or authorized to close in New York, New York and the term "Person"
shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or

"Effective Time"); and shall be immediately followed by the Accessible Account
Deposit.

all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
reorganized Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the reorganized Company (to the extent
not assumed by Reorganized TCEH or discharged under the Plan of
Reorganization) and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Company.

Section 1.7 Accessible Account Deposit. At the Closing, (a) Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to deliver the Cash Deposit Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the EFH Plan Administrator Board (as defined in the Plan of

available funds, to the EFH/EFIH Cash Distribution Account, and (c) EFIH will
send any cash held by EFIH as of the Closing Date, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to the EFH/EFIH Cash Distribution Account (such
deposits in clause (a), clause (b) and clause (c) herein, the "Accessible
Account Deposit"); provided, however, that in no event shall cash held by the
Company or EFIH to the extent comprising any dividend paid by Oncor in respect
of earnings or income for any period from and after January 1, 2018 be sent to
the EFH/EFIH Cash Contribution Account, but instead shall be retained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries. The EFH Plan Administrator Board shall
distribute the amounts from the Accessible Account Deposit in accordance with
the Plan of Reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, the EFH Plan
Administrator Board shall be entitled to create such sub-accounts in the
EFH/EFIH Cash Distribution Account as necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization. "Cash Deposit Amount" shall mean
$9,450,000,000, less the DIP Repayment; provided, that the Cash Deposit Amount
shall be reduced in accordance with Section 1.8; provided, further, that (i)
it is expected that Oncor will pay a dividend to Oncor Holdings and that Oncor
Holdings will pay such dividend to EFIH in respect of amounts earned by Oncor
during the period starting as of October 1, 2017 and ending on December 31,
2017 (such a dividend, a "2017 Dividend"), (ii) if the Closing occurs prior to
the payment of such 2017 Dividend to EFIH, then the Cash Deposit Amount shall
be increased by an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the actual
2017 Dividend (the "Payable Dividend Amount"), and the Surviving Company shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, such Payable Dividend Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the EFH/EFIH Cash Distribution
Account within five (5) Business Days following receipt by EFIH of such 2017
Dividend, and (iii) if the Closing occurs at any time following the payment of
any 2017 Dividend, then the Cash Deposit Amount shall be reduced by an amount
equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the actual 2017 Dividend (the "Dividend
Reduction Amount"). In no event shall the amount deposited by Merger Sub
pursuant to Section 1.7(a), plus the DIP Repayment, plus the value of the
Trust Certificates issued pursuant to Section 1.8 exceed $9,450,000,000, plus,
if applicable, the Payable Dividend Amount, or minus if applicable, the
Dividend Reduction Amount.

Section 1.8 Adjustments for Equity Issuances.

(a) To the extent that the applicable Stakeholders elect (or are required), in
accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, to receive equity in New HoldCo
(as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) ("New HoldCo Equity Interests") in
lieu of cash for all or a portion of their respective EFH Consideration or
EFIH Consideration, as applicable, then such Stakeholders shall be required to
contribute such New HoldCo Equity Interests to the

Rollover Trust (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) in return for
Rollover Trust Certificates (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) ("Trust
Certificates"), and the Cash Deposit Amount shall, except to the extent
otherwise provided in a Plan Supplement contemplated by Section 1.8(b), be
reduced by an amount equal to the cash amount to which such Stakeholders would
have otherwise been entitled absent such receipt of New HoldCo Equity
Interests.

(b) In the event the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") indicates that it
will not provide one or more of the required Supplemental Rulings unless the
consideration payable to the EFH Stakeholders (the "EFH Consideration") in
accordance with the Plan of Reorganization and/or the consideration payable to
the EFIH Stakeholders in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization (the "EFIH
Consideration") includes some (or an additional) amount of New HoldCo Equity
Interests, then (i) Parent shall cause New HoldCo Equity Interests, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, to be issued to certain Stakeholders
pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, in an amount sufficient to obtain the
Supplemental Rulings, and (ii) such Stakeholders that receive such New HoldCo
Equity Interests shall immediately thereafter contribute such New HoldCo
Equity Interests to the Rollover Trust (as defined in the Plan of
Reorganization) in return for Trust Certificates; provided, however, that in
the event the IRS indicates that (a) the amount of New HoldCo Equity Interests
necessary to obtain the Supplemental Rulings is in an amount greater than the
difference between (x) $2,500,000,000 and (y) the value of Trust Certificates
issued to Rollover Trust Participants (as defined in the Plan of
Reorganization) (the "Maximum Required New HoldCo Issuance"), or (b) the
granting of New HoldCo Equity Interests and the contribution of such New
HoldCo Equity Interests to the Rollover Trust (as defined in the Plan of
Reorganization) in exchange for Trust Certificates is insufficient to obtain
one or more Supplemental Rulings, then the Company, EFIH (to the extent any
such New HoldCo Equity Interests are anticipated to be issued to EFIH
Stakeholders), Merger Sub and Parent shall cooperate, work and negotiate in
good faith to identify an alternative structure or issue such other amount
and/or form of equity consideration necessary to obtain the Supplemental
Rulings; provided, however, the terms and conditions of such alternative
structure, the amount of equity consideration, and/or the terms or conditions
of such equity interest other than Trust Certificates shall be subject to the
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of the final proviso
to the preceding sentence, for the avoidance of doubt it shall not be
unreasonable for Parent to withhold its consent to a proposal or structure
that would require it to issue or cause the issuance of (a) any common stock
or preferred stock or other equity interests of Parent, (b) New HoldCo Equity
Interests in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Required New HoldCo Issuance,
or (c) New HoldCo Equity Interests with terms that are different than as set
forth on Exhibit C. In all cases, the Company, EFIH, and Parent each
understand that any issuance of equity (including New HoldCo Equity Interests)
is not intended to increase or decrease the overall amount of consideration
received by EFH Stakeholders or EFIH Stakeholders or the total amount of
merger consideration payable by Parent (the "Value Condition"). To the extent
New HoldCo Equity Interests must be issued pursuant to this paragraph, the
mechanics implementing this paragraph shall be included in a Plan Supplement
document that is reasonably acceptable to the Company, EFIH, Merger

in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Parent
and Merger Sub have each made available to the Company a complete and correct
copy of the certificate of formation and bylaws or comparable governing
documents of each of Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended through the date

authorized and validly issued, and the owners of such equity securities have
no obligation to make capital contributions or other payments with respect to
such equity securities under the organizational or governing documents of such

by New HoldCo and, assuming all Stakeholders receiving New HoldCo Equity
Interests contribute such New HoldCo Equity Interests to the Rollover Trust as
required by the Plan of Reorganization, all of the outstanding New HoldCo
Equity Interests will be directly owned by Parent, the Rollover Trust and/or

Certificate will be duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with the

necessary to approve this Agreement, the Oncor Letter Agreement, the Closing
Date Transactions, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority
and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Oncor Letter Agreement and
any other agreement contemplated herein to be entered into by Parent or Merger
Sub. This Agreement and the Oncor Letter Agreement have been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub (as applicable) and each

required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents,

Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and Merger
Sub of the Closing Date Transactions and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except those the failure of which to make or obtain has not
had and would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub does not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
certificate of incorporation, certificate of formation or bylaws or comparable
governing documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (B) with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Laws or governmental or non-governmental permit or license
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject; (C) any change in the
rights or obligations of any party under any such Contracts; or (D) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.2(d)(i), a violation of
any Law to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the
case of clause (B), (C) or (D) above, for any breach, violation, termination,
default, creation, acceleration or change that has not had and would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Parent Reports; Financial Statements.

(i) Parent has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and other documents (including
exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto, and other information
incorporated therein) required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or any Contract governing
any indebtedness of Parent requiring such filings to be made since the
Applicable Date (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents
filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished
subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto, the "Parent
Reports"). Each of the Parent Reports, including any financial statements or
schedules included therein, at the time of its filing or being furnished
complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to the Parent Reports. As of their respective
dates (or, if amended prior to, or after, the date hereof, as of the date of
such amendment), the Parent Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC prior
to the date hereof did not, and any Parent Reports filed with or furnished to
the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will


 

--- 
| | 

|

37 

not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments received
from the SEC staff with respect to the Parent Reports. None of the Parent
Reports is, to the knowledge of Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

(ii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports as amended prior to the date hereof
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects, or, in the case of Parent Reports filed after the date hereof, will
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of Parent and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date (and if amended, as of the date
of the last such amendment prior to the date hereof) and each of the
statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and
shareholders' equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
Reports (including any related notes and schedules), as finally amended prior
to the date hereof, fairly presents in all material respects, or in the case
of Parent Reports filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all
material respects the financial position, results of operations and cash
flows, as the case may be, of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
notes and normal year-end adjustments), in each case in accordance with GAAP,
except as may be noted therein.

(iii) Parent maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such
internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, in each
case, in all material respects. Except as has not had, or would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on
the nature or reliability of the information disclosed in Parent's periodic
reports filed under the Exchange Act, (A) Parent maintains disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent is
recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of Parent's filings with the SEC and other public disclosure
documents (including Parent's chief executive officer and chief financial
officer) and (B) Parent has not disclosed, and is not required to disclose,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of Parent's board of
directors, and has not had, (1) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information in any material respect and (2) any
fraud, known to Parent, whether or not material, that involves


 

--- 
| | 

|

38 

management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal
controls over financial reporting.

(iv) Except as has not had and would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has a commitment to become a
party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract or arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Parent Reports or the financial statements included
therein.

(f) Absence of Certain Changes. Since December 31, 2016, there has not
occurred a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than liabilities and
obligations (A) set forth in Parent's consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2016, including the notes thereto, included in the Company
Reports, (B) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since December 31, 2016, (C) incurred in connection with the Closing
Date Transactions or any other transaction or agreement contemplated by this
Agreement, (D) pursuant to any Contract that would be required to be filed by
Parent as a "material contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the Securities Act, except for any such Contract that is a
Benefit Plan) or that was or is material to the business, operations or
financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but not
including any liability for breach thereunder), or (E) that has not had and
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

For purposes of this Agreement "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means (i) any
fact, event, change, effect, development, circumstance or occurrence that,
individually or together with all other facts, events, changes, effects,
developments, circumstances or occurrences, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on, or change in, the financial
condition, business, assets, liabilities or results of operations of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the avoidance of doubt any
reference in any provision hereof to any item that "would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect", or any similar phrase, shall be interpreted as
"individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably expected to
have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect" (and such interpretation shall extend
to the negative expression of such phrase, or any similar phrase, mutatis
mutandis), or (ii) anything that prevents, materially restricts, or materially
impairs Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Closing Date Transactions;
provided, however, that, none of the following


 

--- 
| | 

|

39 

shall constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has
been or is a Parent Material Adverse Effect:

(i) (x) changes or developments in general economic or political conditions or
the securities, credit or financial markets, in general, globally or outside
of or in the U.S. or in the State of Texas or (y) changes that are the result
of acts of war or terrorism or any hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood,
earthquake or other natural disaster or other weather-related event,
circumstance or development (other than such acts of war or terrorism or any
hurricane, tornado, tsunami, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster or
other weather-related event, circumstance or development that cause any
physical damage or destruction to or render physically or operationally
unusable any facility or property of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries);

(ii) any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal, modification,
reinterpretation or proposal of any rule, regulation, ordinance, order,
protocol or any other Law of or by any national, regional, state or local
regulatory Governmental Entity (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
RTOs);

(iii) changes or developments generally affecting electric transmission or
distribution systems (other than changes or developments that render
operationally unusable any facility or property of Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries);

(iv) changes or developments that are the result of factors generally
affecting any industry in which Parent or its Subsidiaries operate;

(v) any loss or threatened loss of, or adverse change or threatened adverse
change in, the relationship of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with its
customers, employees, regulators, financing sources or suppliers to the extent
caused by the pendency or the announcement of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or Plan of Reorganization;

(vi) changes, effects or developments to the extent relating to the entry into
this Agreement, the performance of actions or obligations required to be taken
by a party hereunder or consented to in writing by the Company and EFIH,
including any change in Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' credit ratings to
the extent resulting therefrom;

(vii) changes or developments in GAAP or authoritative interpretation thereof
after the date hereof; and

(viii) any failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to meet any internal
or public projections or forecasts or estimates of revenues or earnings for
any period, in and of itself, provided that the exception in this clause shall
not prevent or otherwise


 

--- 
| | 

|

40 

affect a determination that any change, effect or development underlying such
failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

provided, further, that (x) facts, events, changes, effects, developments,
circumstances or occurrences set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been or is a Parent
Material Adverse Effect to the extent such matters, changes, effects or
developments have a disproportionate and adverse effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other entities engaged in the
relevant business in Texas or other relevant geographic area and (y) any
condition or requirement attached to any order or approval issued by the PUCT,
FERC or FCC that is necessary or was sought in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and/or the Plan of Reorganization
shall not constitute, or be deemed to contribute to, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(g) Litigation. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits,
complaints, enforcement actions, penalty assessments, claims, hearings,
arbitrations, investigations, inquiries, audits or other proceedings (formal
or informal, public or non-public) pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened in writing against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or subject to the provisions of any judgment, settlement, order, writ,
injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity specifically imposed
upon Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses,
assets or properties which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Financing. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company and EFIH true, correct and complete copies of (A) an
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (as
amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after
the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section 6.21, the "Debt
Commitment Letter"), from the lenders and each other Person (including,
without limitation, each agent and arranger and any lenders who become party
thereto by joinder or otherwise) party thereto (collectively, the "Lenders"),
together with their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents, equityholders, advisors and representatives and their respective
successors and assigns involved in the Debt Financing (as defined below) or
other financings in connection with the Debt Financing, including (without
limitation) any commitment letters, engagement letters, credit agreements,
loan agreements or indentures relating thereto (the "Financing Sources")
pursuant to which the Lenders or their respective Affiliates have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide to Merger Sub the
amount of indebtedness set forth therein (the debt financing of Merger Sub
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any debt securities to
be incurred in connection with the Bond Financing (as defined below)),
together with any permitted Alternative Debt Financing (as defined below), is
collectively referred to in this Agreement as, the "Debt Financing"), and (B)
the fee letter referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter (with solely the fee
amounts, pricing caps and other economic "market flex" monetary terms redacted
in a customary manner

41 

(none of which would adversely affect or reduce the amount or availability of
the Debt Financing) (as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended
from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section
6.21, the "Fee Letter"). The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended,
restated, or otherwise modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in
any respect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor, as of
the date hereof, is any such amendment, restatement, modification, withdrawal
or rescission currently contemplated or the subject of current discussions. As
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i) the Debt Commitment
Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (except
as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles), (ii) no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach, or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent,
on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other Person, under
any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter, (iii)
except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or the unredacted portions
of the Fee Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligation of the
Financing Sources to provide the Debt Financing, and (iv) except as set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter or the unredacted portions of the Fee Letter,
there are no contractual contingencies or other provisions under any agreement
(including any side letters or similar arrangements) relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which Parent is a party that
would permit the applicable Debt Financing Sources to reduce the total amount
of the Debt Financing, respectively, or impose any additional fees or
conditions precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing, respectively.
As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the truth and accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company and EFIH contained in this
Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions to be satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment
Letter or the Fee Letter at the time it is required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereunder, nor does Parent have knowledge, as of the
date of this Agreement, that any of the Lenders or their respective Affiliates
or Sponsors will not perform their respective funding obligations under the
Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms and conditions. Parent has
caused any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or
before the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter to be paid in full, and will cause any such amounts due
on or before the Effective Time pursuant to such terms and the terms of this
Agreement to be paid in full. The funds available to Parent, at the Closing,
shall be sufficient to pay the Cash Deposit Amount, the DIP Repayment and all
other amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.7 by any of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Company or EFIH, and Parent shall otherwise have sufficient cash
available to pay all fees and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated hereunder. All of the issued and outstanding
equity interests

42 

of Merger Sub are validly issued and outstanding, and are, and at the
Effective Time will be, directly or indirectly owned by Parent; provided,
however, that immediately prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub and New
HoldCo will be owned directly or indirectly by Parent and one or more Delaware
trusts, as described in the Plan of Reorganization. Except in connection with
its formation, as contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of
Reorganization or otherwise relating to the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereunder, Merger Sub has not, and prior to the Effective Time
will not have, engaged in any business activities of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person.

(j) Brokers. No agent, broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for which the Company could have any
liability prior to the Effective Time.

(k) Taxes. Merger Sub is classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

(l) Regulatory Status. Parent is a public utility holding company under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 ("PUHCA"). Merger Sub is not a
public utility holding company under PUHCA. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is a
public utility under the Federal Power Act.

(m) Oncor Entities. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the ability of the
Company and EFIH to exercise control over the Oncor Entities, or cause the
Oncor Entities to take any action, is limited due to applicable Law (including
the Prior PUCT Order) and the provisions set forth in the Oncor Agreements.

(n) Claims. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries belongs to any Class of
Claims (as such terms are defined in the Plan of Reorganization) against the
E-Side Debtors.

Company shall provide prior written notice to Parent of the submission of any

51 

the Company nor EFIH shall enter into any agreement or commitment which
prohibits the Company or EFIH, as a condition of an Acquisition Proposal or as
a condition to the submission of an Acquisition Proposal, from furnishing the

as the case may be, shall have determined in good faith (in each case, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
and based on advice of such counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, and after such three (3) Business Days the Company Board or
the board of managers of EFIH, as the case may be, may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or Section 8.3(f), as applicable and
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement, if concurrently with such
termination, it determines in its sole discretion after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and based on advice
of such counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and,
that as a result, the failure to terminate this Agreement is inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties. In determining whether to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(e) or Section 8.3(f), the relevant board shall take
into account all changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
after the date hereof in response to such a Company Notice, and any other
information deemed relevant or appropriate by such board. The obligations set
forth in this Section 6.2(e) are in addition to those set forth in the other
provisions of this Section 6.2, including for the avoidance of doubt Section
6.2(f).

(f) Following the entry of the Approval Order, the Company or EFIH shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable (i) and in any event before engaging in, or
continuing, any material discussions with any Person (or its Representatives)
who submits, or has submitted, an Acquisition Proposal, or providing material
information to such Person (or its Representatives), enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person (to the extent an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement is not already in effect with such Person), and
advise Parent in writing of each such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any material
changes to such material terms and conditions promptly after receipt thereof)
and provide to Parent a copy of each Company Acquisition Agreement relating to
such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of such Person and its
Representatives; (ii) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material
information that it or its Representatives make available to each such Person
described in preceding clause (i) or its Representatives which was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub, concurrently with the
making available of such information to such Person or its Representatives;
and (iii) inform Parent and Merger Sub of any material developments with
respect to each Acquisition Proposal described in this sentence. The
obligations set forth in this Section 6.2(f) shall apply with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal submitted before or after the date hereof, and the
Company and EFIH acknowledge and agree that, to the extent an Acquisition
Proposal which meets the requirements for discussions or other actions to
occur as contemplated by this Section 6.2 is submitted by or on behalf of a
Person with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has previously entered
a confidentiality agreement, such obligations set forth in this Section 6.2(f)
may require an amendment to such agreement in order for such Acquisition
Proposal to be pursued by the Company or EFIH. To the extent that Parent or
any of its Affiliates receive the identity of any other potential acquiror
from the Company or EFIH pursuant to


 

--- 
| | 

|

52 

this Section 6.2, the recipient thereof shall maintain the confidentiality of
such identity, and shall only share such identity with its legal advisors for
purposes of receiving legal advice.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during the period
beginning at the date of the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order and
continuing until the earlier of the Termination Date or the Closing Date, the
Company and EFIH and their Representatives shall have the right to: (x)
solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate Backup Plan Proposals,
including by way of providing access to non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; (y) enter into, maintain or continue discussions or
negotiations with respect to Backup Plan Proposals or otherwise cooperate with
or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations; and (z) adopt, approve, recommend, or enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to or propose to adopt, approve,
recommend, or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to (publicly or
otherwise) any such Backup Plan Proposal; provided, however, that the Company
and EFIH shall use commercially reasonable efforts (x) to keep confidential
any solicitation, negotiation, facilitation, and documentation by any Debtor
of a Backup Plan Proposal, and (y) to enter into confidentiality agreements
with any counterparty to any agreement regarding support for and/or financing
of a Backup Plan Proposal, which confidentiality agreement provides that the
existence and terms of such Backup Plan Proposal shall be kept confidential
and shall not be publicly disclosed, except in each case to the extent
required by applicable Law.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement that
contains provisions that are not less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and, solely to
the extent executed after the date of this Agreement, does not prohibit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing information to Parent that
Parent is expressly entitled to receive from the Company in accordance with
this Section 6.2.

"Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from or by a
Person (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective
agents and Representatives) with respect to (i) a merger, acquisition,
consolidation, dissolution, equitization, equity investment, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, plan of reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company and/or one
or more of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any other transaction involving the
Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries which results in the direct or
indirect acquisition of more than 20% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis or in the direct or indirect acquisition
of more than 20% of the equity interests or voting power of the Company, EFIH
or any of the Oncor Entities; provided, however, that a Backup Plan Proposal
(as defined below) shall not constitute an Acquisition Proposal.

|

53 

"Backup Plan Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer that (i) would
constitute an Acquisition Proposal (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a
standalone plan of reorganization negotiated with existing creditors of the
Company or EFIH) and, (ii) by its terms, contemplates consummation or closing
of such Backup Plan Proposal only after termination of this Agreement other
than a termination arising as a result of the adoption, approval,
recommendation, or entry into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Backup Plan Proposal.

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except that
references to 20% shall be changed to 50%) which the Company Board or the
board of managers EFIH, as the case may be, determines in good faith would, if
consummated, result in a superior transaction to the Company or EFIH, as
applicable, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and based on advice of such counsel, and, taking into account (x) the
likelihood and timing of consummation and (y) all material legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), conditionality,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization.

(v) Parent shall, pursuant to the Oncor Letter Agreement or otherwise, and the

contain all of the key terms and undertakings set forth in Exhibit D hereto
(the "Key Regulatory Terms"), and to resolve any investigation or other
inquiry of any Governmental Entity (and the staffs thereof), including the
PUCT, in each case, as may be necessary or reasonably advisable to be made or

all material information that appears in any filing made with, or written

the other hand, agree not to schedule, to the extent reasonably practicable,

reasonable opportunity to

| | 

|

56 

participate in such meeting or communication to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity and to the extent with respect to matters involving any of
the Applications, unless Parent reasonably believes that such participation
would be imprudent provided that Parent may not exclude the Company or EFIH
from any such meeting or communication if a Governmental Entity has requested
that the Company or EFIH participate, and in any event the parties hereto
shall keep each other reasonably apprised of all material substantive
communications with Governmental Entities of which they are aware regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization.
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company and EFIH, on the other

hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates (other than, with respect to the
Company, the Oncor Entities, subject to Section 6.20 and with respect to
Parent, its regulated Subsidiaries and regulated controlled Affiliates),
directors, officers and equityholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing,

or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities subject
to Section 6.20 hereof) to or with any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Applications.

Court or any other Governmental Entity, the Company and EFIH, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization,
including, upon reasonable request, promptly furnishing the other with copies
of notices or other communications received by Parent or Merger Sub or the
Company or EFIH, as the case may be, or any of their Subsidiaries (other than
the Oncor Entities, subject to Section 6.20), from the Bankruptcy Court or any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization. The Company and
EFIH will also keep Parent reasonably and regularly advised of the status and
progress of, and provide to Parent any information reasonably requested by

(d) Regulatory Matters. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant
to this Section 6.3, each of the Company and EFIH and Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, the
following actions:

(i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity (including the FCC, the FERC and the PUCT) with
jurisdiction over any Company Approvals or Parent Approvals of information and
documents reasonably requested by any such court or Governmental Entity or
that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization;

(ii) with respect to the HSR Filing, obtaining the expiration or earlier
termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and with respect to the FCC
Approval, the FERC Approval and the PUCT Approval and all other approvals and
consents of a Governmental Entity, obtaining all such necessary approvals and
avoiding the entry or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law
that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit, or materially impair, restrain or restrict, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization,
including Parent and Merger Sub, subject to the first sentence of the last
paragraph of Section 6.3(e), taking all actions required by, and accepting all
conditions and/or requirements imposed under the terms of any, consent,
registration, order, approval or authorization issued by any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Plan of Reorganization to the extent that any such condition or
requirement is a Key Regulatory Term or is not otherwise a Burdensome
Condition; and

(iii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization unlawful or that would prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit,
or materially impair, restrain or restrict, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization, vacate, modify, reverse,
suspend, prevent, eliminate, avoid, remove or comply with such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, decree or enactment so as to permit prompt consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Acceptable Conditions. Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, (A) Parent and Merger Sub shall
not be required to, and (B) the Company, EFIH and their Subsidiaries (other
than the Oncor Entities, subject to Section 6.20) shall not be permitted to,
without the prior written consent of Parent, take


 

--- 
| | 

|

58 

any action pursuant to this Section 6.3 or otherwise if the taking of such
efforts or action, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a
Burdensome Condition.

"Burdensome Condition" means any term or condition, order, sanction,
requirement, law, rule or regulation that, individually or in the aggregate,
would, or would be reasonably expected to have a material and adverse effect
on, or change in, the condition (financial or otherwise), business, assets,
liabilities or results of operations of (i) Oncor and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as whole; provided
that, for purposes of this clause (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, shall be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities that is the size
and scale of the Oncor Entities; provided, however, that terms or conditions,
orders, sanctions, requirements, laws, rules or regulations that result in
changes or developments generally affecting electric transmission or
distribution systems in the State of Texas shall not be deemed to be, or
contribute to, a Burdensome Condition (except such changes or developments
affecting electric transmission or distribution systems in the State of Texas
shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been or is a
Burdensome Condition to the extent such changes, or developments have a
disproportionate and adverse effect on Oncor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (where Parent and its
Subsidiaries, including the Oncor Entities, are deemed to be a consolidated
group of entities that is the size and scale of the Oncor Entities), as
compared to other entities engaged in the relevant business in the State of
Texas); provided, further, that, the approval of any of the Key Regulatory
Terms, or any comparable condition, requirement or similar item that, in each
case, is substantively the same or results in the same effect as any of the
Key Regulatory Terms, by the PUCT shall not be deemed to be, or contribute to,
a Burdensome Condition, but adverse variations or changes to any of the Key
Regulatory Terms may contribute to, or be, a Burdensome Condition.

Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.3, shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates to agree
to the sale, license, divestiture, hold separate or other disposition of any
assets, categories of assets or businesses or other segments of Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries). In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries are
required to agree to the sale, license, divestiture, hold separate or other
disposition of any assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with obtaining a Company Approval,
then such requirement may contribute to, or be, a Burdensome Condition.

(f) Confidentiality. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
therein, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
execution of this Agreement and shall expire upon the earliest to occur of (i)
the Closing, and (ii) two (2) years from the date hereof. All information
disclosed pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.3 shall require any party (i) to
violate any of its binding obligations with respect to confidentiality, (ii)
to disclose any

59 

privileged information or (iii) to violate any applicable Laws or Orders;
provided, that, as applicable, each of the Company and EFIH, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, provide notice to each other that any information is being
withheld pursuant to this provision and shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to find a mutually agreeable solution to any
such confidentiality and/or privilege concerns, including providing any such
privileged information pursuant to a joint defense agreement.

(g) Bankruptcy Actions. The Company and EFIH, individually and on behalf of
the E-Side Debtors, each agree that:

(i) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file a motion for entry of

avoidance of doubt, shall seek approval of, among other things, the
Termination Fee in favor of Parent pursuant to the terms hereof;

(ii) it shall use good faith efforts to file the Plan of Reorganization and
disclosure statement in connection with Plan of Reorganization (the

mutually agreed to between Parent, on the one hand, and the Company and EFIH,
on the other hand);

(iii) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of the
Approval Order by September 30, 2017; provided that entry of such order shall
be deemed to occur upon an oral indication by the Bankruptcy Court that it is
approving or will approve the E-Side Debtors' entry into and performance and
agreement under this Agreement, including payment and satisfaction of the
Termination Fee pursuant to the terms hereof;

(iv) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of the
Disclosure Statement Order by September 30, 2017; provided, that entry of such

that it is approving or will approve the Disclosure Statement and solicitation
materials as containing "adequate information" as required by section 1125 of
the Bankruptcy Code;

(v) it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of the EFH
Confirmation Order within 30 days of entry of PUCT Approval; provided, that,
entry of such order shall be deemed to occur upon an oral indication by the
Bankruptcy Court that it is approving or will approve confirmation of the Plan
of Reorganization

(vi) it shall use good faith efforts to negotiate and document definitive
documents and agreements governing the Plan of Reorganization and to take such
actions as the E-Side Debtors in good faith deem reasonable and appropriate to
obtain

| | 

|

60 

Bankruptcy Court approval of such documents and agreements as soon as
reasonably practicable;

(vii) it shall not assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease
to which it is a party pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code without
the prior written consent of Parent, except as otherwise required by the Plan
of Reorganization;

(viii) it shall not establish any additional Supplemental Bar Dates (as
defined in the Order (A) Setting a Supplemental Bar Date for Ninety
Subsequently Identified Parties, (B) Approving Notice Thereof, and (C)
Establishing Related Procedures [Docket No. 8507]);

(ix) to the extent any E-Side Debtor has any right to vote or direct the vote
of any claims (as defined in 11 U.S.C. Â§ 101(5)) against any other E-Side
Debtor, the Company or EFIH shall, or shall cause such E-Side Debtor, to vote
or direct such vote in favor of the Plan of Reorganization;

(x) it shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (a) provide to counsel for
Parent draft copies of all material motions, pleadings, and other documents
that any of the E-Side Debtors intend to file with any court or regulatory

relating to this Agreement or the Plan of Reorganization, or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at least three (3) Business Days
before the date on which such E-Side Debtor intends to file any such document;
provided, however, that the Company and EFIH shall provide to counsel for
Parent draft copies of the Disclosure Statement, solicitation materials in
respect of the Plan of Reorganization, Disclosure Statement Order (as defined
below), Approval Order, and EFH Confirmation Order at least five (5) Business
Days before the date on which the E-Side Debtors intend to file any such
document; provided further, however, that Parent acknowledges such three (3)
or five (5) Business Day period, as applicable, may not be reasonably
practicable in all cases and that in such cases the filing party shall provide
as much advance notice as is reasonably practicable; and (b) incorporate all
reasonably requested comments, modifications, or amendments of Parent in any
such motion, pleading, or other document; provided further, however, that the
EFH Confirmation Order and Approval Order shall be in a form and substance
acceptable to Parent, and shall not be, in any respect that is materially
adverse to Parent, altered, amended, modified or supplemented without the
consent of Parent;

(xi) the E-Side Debtors and their Representatives shall use their reasonable
best efforts to (x) consult in advance with Parent to the extent reasonably
practicable, with respect to statements anticipated to be made on the record
in any court (including the Bankruptcy Court) or before any regulatory body
that are related to the Plan of Reorganization or this Agreement; and (y)
consider in good faith all reasonably requested comments, modifications, or
amendments of Parent in any such statement described in clause (x);

|

61 

(xii) in the event that any order of any court (including the Bankruptcy
Court) or regulatory body (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent)
reasonably necessary to consummate the Plan of Reorganization and all other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is appealed or a stay pending
appeal is sought, the E-Side Debtors and Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to oppose the appeal or the stay pending appeal and
seek the dismissal of any appeal; and

(xiii) the Company and EFIH shall not, and shall not cause any E-Side Debtor
to, without the prior written consent of Parent, request or apply for an order
of the Bankruptcy Court (and, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent
prior to the entry of such order by the Bankruptcy Court, each of the Company
and EFIH will use commercially reasonable efforts to challenge any such
request or application before the Bankruptcy Court) ordering the substantive
consolidation of the Chapter 11 estates of any of the E-Side Debtors until the
earlier of, with respect to each E-Side Debtor, (x) such time as the
termination of this Agreement in accordance its terms, and (y) the
consummation of the Plan of Reorganization and all other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.4 Access and Reports. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, the Company and EFIH shall (and each shall cause its Subsidiaries
(other than the Oncor Entities) to) afford Parent's officers and other
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period from the date hereof through the earlier of the Termination Date and
the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books, contracts and records
and, during such period, the Company and EFIH shall (and each shall cause its
Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities) to) furnish to Parent all such
information concerning its business, properties, facilities, operations and
personnel as Parent reasonably requests; provided that, no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall (a) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (b) affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein; and
provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to (i) permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgment of the Company or such Subsidiary would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
or any of its Subsidiaries' obligations with respect to confidentiality if the
Company or such Subsidiary shall have used reasonable best efforts to furnish
such information in a manner that does not result in any such disclosure,
including obtaining the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure, (ii) disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries if the Company or such Subsidiary shall have used reasonable
best efforts to furnish such information in a manner that does not result in
the loss of such privilege or (iii) permit any invasive environmental
investigation or sampling, including a Phase II environmental assessment. All
information requested pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be governed by the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.5 Publicity. The initial press release or press releases regarding

62 

any press releases or otherwise making public announcements (except as
required by Law) with respect to the Closing Date Transactions.

Section 6.6 Employee Benefits.

(a) On or prior to the date of the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off, the Company and
EFIH took, and caused their respective Subsidiaries to take all such actions
within their control as were necessary, appropriate or desirable to transfer
the sponsorship, maintenance and administration of, and all liabilities (and
related contracts or agreements with third parties) in respect of, the
Contributed Plans to Vistra Energy or its Subsidiaries. Vistra Energy shall
transfer the liabilities related to the post-retirement health, life, dental
and vision benefits for participants previously employed by certain
discontinued operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
predecessors, and the participants' beneficiaries previously disclosed to
Parent and the related accrued benefits liabilities (the "DiscOp OPEB
Liabilities") from the EFH Retiree Welfare Plan to a new mirror health and
welfare plan established by Vistra Energy or another plan reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company (the "New DiscOp OPEB Plan") which such
plan shall be transferred to and assumed by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries prior to or on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, upon
the transfer of the New DiscOp OPEB Plan to the Company or its Subsidiary, the
New DiscOp OPEB Plan (including the DiscOp OPEB Liabilities) shall be an
Assumed Plan and the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Vistra Energy and its Subsidiaries from and against any claim,
action, suit, proceeding relating to any modification or termination of the
post-retirement health and life benefits to any DiscOp OPEB Participants on or
after the Closing Date. Parent, the Company and Vistra Energy shall take all
actions necessary to effectuate the transfer of the New DiscOp OPEB Plan from
Vistra Energy to Parent or Company as soon as administratively practicable
following the establishment of such plan, but in any event prior to the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off date and ending
on the date the New DiscOp OPEB Plan is assumed by the Company or its
Subsidiary as set forth in this Section 6.6, the Company, the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries shall reimburse Reorganized TCEH and its
Affiliates for all claims incurred by DiscOp OPEB Participants under the EFH
Retiree Welfare Plan or New DiscOp OPEB Plan, as applicable, plus any
reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by Reorganized TCEH and its
Affiliates in providing such benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except
as otherwise provided herein (including, without limitation, the Assumed
Plans) or in the Split Participant Agreement (as defined below), none of
Parent, any Oncor Entity or any of their Affiliates shall assume or otherwise
incur any liability or obligation under any compensatory, severance or similar
arrangement in respect of any Non-Oncor Employee (as defined below). For
purposes of Section 6.6(a):

"Non-Oncor Employee" means consistent with past practices (i) any individual
employed by the Company, EFIH, TCEH, Reorganized TCEH or any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Oncor Entities) on or immediately
following the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off or (ii) any individual formerly
employed by TCEH or any Affiliate of TCEH or Reorganized TCEH (which for this
purpose would


 

--- 
| | 

|

63 

constitute an Affiliate immediately following the Closing Date), other than an
Oncor Employee;

"Oncor Employee" means consistent with past practices (i) any individual
employed by an Oncor Entity on or immediately following the Closing Date or
(ii) any individual formerly employed by an Oncor Entity or, by any
predecessor regulated electric utility business on a full time basis, who
terminated employment with and did not subsequently become employed by a non-
Oncor Entity; and

"Split Participant Service" means service of Oncor Employees or Non-Oncor
Employees, as applicable, whose employment includes service with both the
Oncor Entities (or a predecessor regulated electric business) and a business
of the Company or its Affiliates other than the Oncor Entities.

(b) EFIH, the Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain unconditional approval of the Bankruptcy Court authorizing the
termination and distribution of all payments and obligations under the
Discharged Plans (other than any such Discharged Plans that are equity based
plans or the Ebasco Services of Canada Limited Pension Plan) prior to the
effective date of the Plan of Reorganization under which the Non-Qualified
Plans are to be discharged; provided, however, if EFIH, the Company and Parent
cannot obtain such unconditional approval of the Bankruptcy Court prior to
such date, such Discharged Plans will be terminated as the effective date of
the Plan of Reorganization under which the Non-Qualified Plans are to be
discharged and paid out and all associated liabilities discharged in
accordance with the terms and procedures of such Plan of Reorganization.

(c) [RESERVED]

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall obligate Parent or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to continue the employment of any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities)
after the Closing Date.

(e) The Company and Parent agree to cooperate in good faith using commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize the risk of any Contributed Plan and Assumed
Plan becoming a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413 of
the Code) or "multiple employer welfare plan" (within the meaning of Section
3(40) of ERISA) following the Closing Date.

(f) The Company and Parent agree to work together in good faith to develop
such timelines, plans, agreements, and communications, and to exchange such
information as is necessary to effectuate the intent of this Section 6.6 in an
orderly manner.

(g) For a period of ninety (90) days immediately following the Closing Date,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall close any facility or lay off
any Employees of the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries, if such closure or
layoff would result in any material obligations or liabilities for Reorganized
TCEH.

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former Employee or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be (i) construed
as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose, or (ii) give any employee
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any
employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any right
to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.6 or (iii) obligate Parent, Merger
Sub, Vistra Energy or any of their respective Affiliates to (A) maintain any
particular benefit plan or refrain from amending or terminating any benefit
plan, except as provided otherwise in the Split Participant Agreement or (B)
retain the employment of any particular employee.

Section 6.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3 and Section
6.21 or any administrative expenses of the Debtors' estates addressed in the
Plan of Reorganization, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Closing Date
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such expense.

Section 6.8 IndemnificationÍ¾ Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time for a period of six (6) years, the
Surviving Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and the Surviving Company shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; provided that, the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former
director, manager and officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
(together, the "Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees and experts' fees), and sums which an
Indemnified Party becomes legally obligated to pay solely as a result of
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, settlements or liabilities
(collectively, "Costs") arising out of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties' service as a manager,
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
services performed by such persons at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the Surviving Company
shall not indemnify any Indemnified Party for any Costs brought about or
contributed to in fact by fraudulent act by such Indemnified Party; and
provided, further, that the Surviving Company shall not be obligated to
reimburse any Indemnified Party for any Costs unless and until such
Indemnified Party has exhausted the limits of recovery from any other Person
obligated to indemnify and reimburse such Indemnified Party (unless the
Company has agreed otherwise in writing prior to the date hereof with any such
other Person, in which case this proviso shall be limited with respect to such
other Person to the extent of such agreement).

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain, effective as of the
Effective Time, and fully pay the premium for a run-off of (i) the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' existing directors', managers' and officers' insurance
policies as of the date hereof, and (ii) the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies as of the date hereof, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim based on alleged acts or omissions
occurring during any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time (it
being understood that, with respect to any claim arising from actual or
alleged acts or omissions of such Persons in their capacity as a current or
former director or officer or other Representative of any of TCEH Companies or
the SpinCo Group (each as defined in the Separation Agreement), such period
shall be limited to the period on or prior to the TCEH Effective Date) from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance")
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
advantageous than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies
with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a current or former director or officer or other Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated
by this Agreement). If the Company, after its good faith efforts to obtain, is
unable to obtain such run-off insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
advantageous than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies
as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date hereofÍ¾ provided, however, that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Company shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) If the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns shall (i)
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.8 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation or formation or bylaws, operating agreement or comparable
governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any
applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of formation,
bylaws, operating agreement or comparable governing documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
continued or be assumed by the Surviving Company following the Merger and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time.

Section 6.9 Resignation of Directors and Officers. Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, except as otherwise may be agreed by Parent in writing, the
Company Board, all officers of the Company and all members of any board of
directors or similar governing body and all officers of any Subsidiary of the
Company (other than the Oncor Entities), in each case who are in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be deemed to have resigned from
such position(s) effective at the Effective Time. In addition, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, EFIH shall cause the Member Directors (as defined
in the Oncor Holdings LLC Agreement) to resign.

Section 6.10 Parent Cooperation. Parent agrees that:

(a) it shall use its good faith efforts to negotiate the documents necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the "Restructuring Documents") in good faith and to take such actions as are
reasonably requested by the E-Side Debtors or as Parent in good faith deems
reasonable and appropriate to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of the
Restructuring Documents as soon as reasonably practicable;

(b) it shall use good faith efforts to assist in obtaining (i) entry of the
Bankruptcy Court order approving the disclosure statement and other
solicitation materials in support of the Plan of Reorganization (the
"Disclosure Statement Order"), the Approval Order, and the EFH Confirmation
Order, and (ii) consummation of the Plan of Reorganization and all other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable
in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and on terms consistent with this
Agreement, including within the timeframes contemplated in this Agreement;

(c) it shall not directly or indirectly, or encourage any other entity to
directly or indirectly: (i) object to, delay, impede, or take any other action
or any inaction to interfere with the acceptance, implementation,
consummation, or amendment (whether before or after confirmation) of the Plan
of Reorganization; or (ii) propose, file, support, vote for, or take

any other action in furtherance of any Acquisition Proposal, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, by making or supporting any filings with the
Bankruptcy Court or any regulatory agency, including the PUCT, the IRS, the
FCC, and the FERC, or by entering into any agreement or making or supporting
any filing, press release, press report or comparable public statement, with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may file with the Bankruptcy Court all documents
necessary to obtain approval of this Agreement and entry of the Approval
Order;

(d) it shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain required
regulatory and/or third-party approvals (including from the PUCT, the IRS, the
FCC, and the FERC, as applicable), and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in obtaining (A) Bankruptcy Court approval of the
Restructuring Documents and entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, and (B) entry
of the Disclosure Statement Order, the Approval Order, and the EFH
Confirmation Order, and any other order of the Bankruptcy Court (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) reasonably necessary to consummate the
Plan of Reorganization and all other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and on terms consistent with
this Agreement; and

(e) If this Agreement is validly terminated (i) in accordance with Section 8.2
or (ii) by the Company/EFIH in accordance with Section 8.3(a) or 8.3(b) of the
Agreement and upon entry of the Approval Order, then neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, or encourage any other entity
to, directly or indirectly, (A) object to, delay, impede, or take any other
action or any inaction to interfere with the acceptance, implementation,
consummation or amendment (whether before or after confirmation; provided that
such amendment was made consistent with this Agreement) of an Acquisition
Proposal; or (B) propose, file, support, or take any other action in
furtherance of any restructuring, workout, plan of arrangement, or plan of
reorganization for the Debtors (including the Plan of Reorganization and the
transactions contemplated therein) other than an Acquisition Proposal,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, making or supporting any filings with
the Bankruptcy Court or any regulatory agency, including the PUCT or the FERC,
or making or supporting any public statements with respect to any
restructuring, workout, plan of arrangement, or plan of reorganization for the
Debtors other than any such plan or restructuring described in clause (A)
above. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be prohibited or
restricted from taking any actions that they determine in their reasonable
discretion are necessary or appropriate, including intervening in any
proceedings before or making or supporting any filings with the PUCT, in order
(x) to preserve and protect their business, operations, goodwill or assets or
(y) based on the advice of counsel, to fulfill the contractual, legal or other
duties and obligations that any such Person has in respect of any such
business, operations, goodwill or assets.

Section 6.14 Tax Matters.

(a) Private Letter Ruling. The Company, on behalf of the Debtors, has received
a private letter ruling (the "Private Letter Ruling") from the IRS in response
to a written request, dated June 10, 2014 (the "Initial Ruling Request," and
together with all related materials and supplements thereto filed with respect
to the Initial Ruling Request, the "Initial IRS Submissions"). The Private
Letter Ruling addresses certain issues related to the qualification of the
Reorganized TCEH Contributions, the Reorganized TCEH Conversion, and the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the Code (collectively, the "Intended Tax-Free
Treatment") and certain other matters. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the Private Letter Ruling is acceptable to the parties hereto with
respect to the Intended Tax-Free Treatment. The transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not conditioned on the receipt of any additional rulings
from the IRS, other than the Supplemental Rulings (defined below).

(b) Supplemental Ruling. The Company has prepared and filed with the IRS a
supplemental ruling request, dated November 3, 2016, that, among other things,
requests rulings that address the effect of the Company's previously
contemplated merger with a direct wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy,
Inc., a Florida Corporation, on certain of the rulings received in the Private
Letter Ruling (the "Prior Supplemental Ruling Request"). The Company shall be
responsible for the preparation and filing with the IRS of one or more
supplemental ruling requests, whether in the form of modifying the Prior
Supplement Ruling Request or in the form of a new request, that, among other
things, request rulings that address the effect of the Merger on certain of
the rulings received in the Private Letter Ruling as reflected on Exhibit E
(such request, the "Supplemental Ruling Request," the rulings to be granted
pursuant thereto, the "Supplemental Rulings," and the materials filed or to be
filed in respect of the Supplemental Ruling Request, the "Supplemental IRS
Submissions" and together with the Initial IRS Submissions, the "IRS
Submissions").

(c) Supplemental IRS Submissions. The Company shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of the Supplemental IRS Submissions. The Company shall
provide tax counsel of Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on drafts of all such IRS Submissions and any pre-filing agreement or
closing agreement that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section
7.1(d) or that could reasonably be determined to affect the treatment of the
restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of
Reorganization to be submitted or entered into on or after the date hereof.
The Company agrees to supplement or modify any Supplemental IRS Submissions
and agreements related to Supplemental IRS Submissions as may be reasonably
requested by Parent; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required
to supplement or modify any Supplemental IRS Submission, request any
additional ruling, or modify any ruling being requested with respect to the
Supplemental Rulings (other than with respect to the effect of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) if the Company determines, in
its reasonable discretion, that making such supplement, modification, or
request could result in any delay in obtaining the Supplemental Rulings or be
otherwise detrimental to the process of obtaining the Supplemental Rulings.
The parties hereto

|

69 

acknowledge and agree that it is anticipated that this Agreement and the facts
related to the contemplated Merger will be disclosed to the IRS pursuant to a
Supplemental IRS Submission. To the extent that the Company, in its good faith
judgment, or upon a reasonable request by any other person, considers any
information included in an IRS Submission or a Supplemental IRS Submission (or
drafts thereof) to be confidential, the Company may redact such documents to
exclude such information before providing such documents to Parent. Subject to
the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent with copies of each
Supplemental IRS Submission promptly following the filing thereof.

(d) IRS Communications and Cooperation. The Company shall notify Parent of any
substantive communications with the IRS regarding the Supplemental IRS
Submissions and restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
by the Plan of Reorganization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a single
Representative from Parent shall be given the opportunity to participate in
all scheduled communications with the IRS concerning the Supplemental Ruling
Requests or any restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
by the Plan of Reorganization, including, (i) all scheduled conference calls
that are expected to address material issues with respect to which there is
sufficient prior notice and the IRS indicates its acceptance of multiple
participants and (ii) all in-person meetings. The Company shall update Parent
in a timely fashion regarding any unscheduled communications from the IRS or
any other communication with respect to which a Representative of Parent does
not participate. The Company and Parent agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to assist in obtaining the rulings requested in the
Supplemental Ruling Requests (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
requested rulings, if any, that are not Supplemental Rulings described on
Exhibit E), including providing such appropriate information and
representations as the IRS shall reasonably require in connection with the
Supplemental Rulings or any restructuring transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and by the Plan of Reorganization. The Company and Parent agree to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide any appropriate
information and additional representations necessary or appropriate in
connection with the Supplemental Rulings. The Company and Parent agree to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to implement any changes to the
restructuring transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the Plan of
Reorganization to the extent such changes would not, unless otherwise agreed
by Parent, result in a material economic detriment to Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries if requested by the IRS in order to issue
reasonably satisfactory Supplemental Rulings; provided, however, that this
sentence shall not apply to any changes to the restructuring transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and by the Plan of Reorganization addressed by
Section 1.8 of this Agreement, with respect to which the terms of Section 1.8
of this Agreement shall govern.

(e) Tax Opinion. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the tax opinion contemplated by Section 7.3(c),
if applicable, and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the tax opinion contemplated by Section 7.2(e), if applicable.

(f) Tax Matters Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) consent to any amendment to
the Tax Matters Agreement or waive any of its or its Affiliates' rights
thereunder or (ii) take or fail to take any action that would constitute a
breach of the Tax Matters Agreement.

(g) Supplemental EandP Ruling. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
Tax Matters Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall, without further
consent of Parent, be permitted, but not required, to file (or join or
otherwise participate in a filing) a request for a supplemental ruling with
the IRS that solely addresses the proper allocation of earnings and profits in
connection with the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off (the "EandP Allocation Ruling
Request"). Parent shall have no consent or participation rights with respect
to such EandP Allocation Ruling Request, provided, however, that the Company
shall provide materials related to the EandP Allocation Ruling Request to Parent
for review and comment, provided, further, that the Company shall not be
required to accept any comments provided by Parent but shall consider any such
comments in good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have the
right to review, comment on and approve any items included in the EandP
Allocation Ruling Request that do not solely address the proper allocation of
earnings and profits in connection with the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off. To the
extent of any inconsistency between the Tax Matters Agreement and any ruling
provided in response to the EandP Allocation Ruling Request, the EandP Allocation
Ruling Request shall control, and Parent hereby consents to any modification
that may be necessary to the Tax Matters Agreement in light of such ruling;
provided, however, that any modification to the Tax Matters Agreement shall
require Parent's consent to the extent such modification does not solely
relate to the proper allocation of earnings and profits in connection with the
Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off.

Section 6.15 RESERVED.

Section 6.16 Transition Services Agreement; Separation Agreement. The Company
and Reorganized TCEH duly executed and delivered a Transition Services
Agreement, dated October 3, 2016 (the "Transition Services Agreement"). The
Company and Reorganized TCEH and OpCo (as defined in the Separation Agreement)
duly executed and delivered the Separation Agreement, dated October 3, 2016
(the "Separation Agreement"), in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.
Following the execution of the Separation Agreement, the Company (i) has used
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with its covenants and
other obligations thereunder, and (ii) has enforced and shall enforce its
rights and remedies thereunder in the event of a material breach by
Reorganized TCEH or OpCo.

Section 6.17 Notice of Current Events. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify each other orally and in writing upon becoming aware of any (i)
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of the other party to effect the Closing not to be satisfied; (ii)
written notice from any third party (other than a notice that has been
previously identified pursuant to the Company Disclosure Letter) alleging that
the consent of such party is or may be required in connection with the Closing
Date Transactions

or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization; and (iii) written notice of any proceeding commenced or, to
the Knowledge of the Company or Parent, threatened against the Company, Parent
or their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities), that has had
or would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that in each
case the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.17 shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to either party, and the failure to deliver any
such notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in Article VII.

Section 6.18 RESERVED.

Section 6.19 RESERVED.

Section 6.20 Oncor Entities.

(a) Each of the Company and EFIH covenants that it will exercise its rights to
consent and vote (if any) under the Oncor Agreements as direct or indirect
equity owners of the Oncor Entities in a manner intended to cause the Oncor
Entities to comply with each of their respective covenants and agreements set
forth in the Oncor Letter Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement and under
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that neither the Company nor EFIH shall be required, in
connection with such party's obligations under this Section 6.20, and their
reasonable best efforts shall not include any obligation, to (A) pay any
amounts to the Oncor Entities or any other Person or incur any liabilities or
other obligation (other than an agreement contemplated hereby or in the Plan
of Reorganization or that confirms or makes effective its obligations
hereunder), (B) execute or enter into or perform any new agreement (other than
an agreement contemplated hereby or in the Plan of Reorganization or that
confirms or makes effective its obligations hereunder), or (C) breach any Law
or commence any Action against any Person, including any of the Oncor Entities
or their respective officers and managers.

(b) Each of the Company and EFIH shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to not permit Oncor Holdings to take, or permit Oncor
to take, any of the actions set forth in the Oncor Holdings LLC Agreement or
the Oncor LLC Agreement, in each case that require the approval or consent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any asset swap for
substantially similar value by Oncor (as reasonably determined by Oncor, the
Company and EFIH) approved by the PUCT.

Section 6.21 Financing.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date and
the Termination Date, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its

on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee
Letter (including, as necessary, "flex" provisions contained in the Fee
Letter) (or replacement financing obtained in compliance with this Section
6.21), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) except as otherwise
permitted in this Section 6.21, maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
and Fee Letter in accordance with their terms, (ii) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "Definitive Agreements")
consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter) or, if available, on other terms that are
acceptable to Parent and would not adversely affect the ability of Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein (and in any event which terms
shall not in any respect expand on the conditions or adversely modify the
conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing at the Closing or reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing available to be funded on the Closing
Date), (iii) satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and the Definitive
Agreements within Parent's control (including payment of all fees and
expenses) and comply with its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letter, and/or Definitive
Agreements in the event of any breach or purported breach thereof. Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take or refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result
in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
or in any Definitive Agreement.

(b) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company and
EFIH (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision
(including any remedy) under, or voluntarily replace (it being understood that
any Alternative Debt Financing (in the event any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable) or any Bond Financing (subject to the limitations set
forth below) shall not be deemed a voluntary replacement for purposes of the
sentence), the Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such amendment,
modification, waiver or voluntary replacement (i) adds new (or adversely
modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing as
compared to those in the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter, each as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, in a manner that would or would
reasonably be expected to make any portion of the Debt Financing less likely
to be timely obtained, (ii) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letter, or
the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, in any material respect, relative to the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against such other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
and Fee Letter, each as in effect on the date hereof or in the Definitive
Agreements, (iii) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (other
than reductions of any amounts thereof constituting increases thereto after
the date hereof), or (iv) could otherwise be expected to prevent, impede or
delay the consummation of any of the Transactions; provided, that for the
avoidance of doubt no consent from the Company or EFIH shall be required: (A)
for any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the Debt
Commitment Letter that is limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter

73 

as of the date of this Agreement, (B) for implementation or exercise of any
"flex" provisions provided in the Fee Letter as in effect as of the date
hereof, (C) for any amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to the
Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements so long as such action would
not be prohibited by the foregoing clauses (i)-(iv) in this Section 6.21(b) or
(D) to add or replace facilities with one or more new facilities or with or
any capital markets debt financing undertaken in replacement of, or in lieu
of, all or any portion of the debt financing (the "Bond Financing") so long as
such replacement facility, new facility or capital markets debt financing does
not adversely affect the conditionality, amount, enforceability, timing,
availability, or termination of the Debt Financing when compared to the Debt
Financing described in Section 5.2(h) on the date hereof and, after giving
effect to such addition or replacement, the representation set forth in the
last sentence of Section 5.2(h) would be correct if made on such date of
replacement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
amendment, modification or replacement of any Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the "Alternative Debt
Financing") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of the
event that renders the Debt Financing unavailable (in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with any then-available Debt Financing pursuant to any
then-existing Debt Commitment Letter, to consummate the Transactions and to
pay related fees and expenses earned, due and payable as of the Effective Time
(such that the representation set forth in the last sentence of Section 5.2(h)
would be correct if made on such date)) on terms not less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Fee Letter that the Alternative Debt Financing would replace (taking into
account any "flex" provisions) from the same or other sources and which do not
include any incremental conditionality to the consummation of such Alternative
Debt Financing that are more onerous to Parent or the Company (in the
aggregate) than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in
effect as of the date of this Agreement or otherwise impede; delay or prevent
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) promptly notify the Company of
such unavailability and the reason therefor. The term "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with
respect to any Alternative Debt Financing arranged in compliance herewith (and
any Debt Commitment Letters remaining in effect at the time in question), (ii)
the term "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any Alternative Debt Financing arranged in
compliance with this Section 6.21(c), and (iii) the term "Financing Sources"
shall be deemed to include any financing sources providing the Alternative
Debt Financing or Bond Financing arranged in compliance herewith.

(d) Parent shall provide the Company with prompt oral and written notice of
any material breach, threatened breach or default by any party to any Debt
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent gains
knowledge and the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Lender, guarantor, or other financing source with respect

to any breach, threatened breach or default or, termination or repudiation by
any party to any Debt Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements or any
provision thereof.

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date and
the Termination Date, the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to
timely provide, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries
(other than Oncor Entities, subject to Section 6.20) and their respective
officers, employees, and representatives to timely provide, reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the
potential equity and debt financing that Parent has previously described to
the Company (the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing"); provided that, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide the Company with notice of any information needed by Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable. The Company's reasonable best efforts contemplated by
this Section 6.21 include the following: (i) assisting with the preparation of
customary materials for rating agencies and rating agency presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing,
together with procuring customary authorization letters authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors (which

or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation which (i) causes any

regard, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and EFIH acknowledge that
their cooperation obligations set forth in Section 6.21(e) include the
obligation to use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with any such
efforts; provided such cooperation obligations are limited to those set forth
in Section 6.21(e).

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives shall be required to take any action that
would subject such Person to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost

payment or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or their performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 6.21 or any information utilized in

therewith (other than arising from information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries). Parent shall, promptly upon request of the Company if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, reimburse the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries (including those of its

goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(h) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the consummation by
Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization is not conditional upon the consummation of, or the receipt by
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates of the proceeds of, the
Financing.

ARTICLE VII

affected by the Company's actions, EFIH, on the one hand, and by Parent, on
the other hand) of the following conditions at or prior to the Closing:

(a) Bankruptcy Orders. The Bankruptcy Court shall have entered (in a form
which is not materially inconsistent, in any substantive legal or economic
respect, with the rights and obligations of the Company or EFIH or Parent or
Merger Sub hereunder or in the Plan of Reorganization) (i) the order of the
Bankruptcy Court approving this Agreement, including, among other things,
approval of the Termination Fee and the Company's and EFIH's entry into and
performance of their obligations under this Agreement and the related
agreements (the "Approval Order") and (ii) an order, in form reasonably
satisfactory to

Parent, confirming the Plan of Reorganization with respect to the E-Side
Debtors and authorizing all of the transactions and agreements contemplated by
this Agreement (the "EFH Confirmation Order"), which in each case shall be in
full force and not subject to any stay.

(b) Orders. No court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains,
enjoins, renders illegal or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Closing
Date Transactions.

(c) Opinion of Counsel with respect to the Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off. The tax
opinion of Kirkland and Ellis LLP obtained by the Company on October 3, 2016 to
the effect that the Reorganized TCEH Contributions, Reorganized TCEH
Conversion and Reorganized TCEH Spin-Off meet the requirements of Sections
368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the Code shall not have been revoked, rescinded
or modified in any respect (except as consented to in writing by Parent).

(d) [RESERVED]

(e) No Liabilities other than Legacy Claims and Limited Real Property Tax
Liens. Assuming the Closing Date Transactions are consummated, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Oncor Entities) will have
any indebtedness for borrowed money immediately following the Effective Time
(other than as contemplated by the Debt Financing). Under the Plan of
Reorganization (and subject to the treatment of Claims provided therein), at
the Effective Time (and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of Reorganization), all
Administrative Claims, DIP Claims and Claims (each as defined in the Plan of
Reorganization), other than the Legacy General Unsecured Claims Against the
EFH Debtors (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization), property tax Claims
secured by liens on real property in an amount not to exceed $100,000 and
other claims that are non-dischargeable under section 1141(d)(6) under the
Bankruptcy Code, will no longer be obligations of the E-Side Debtors and will
be paid only from the Accessible Account Deposit as provided in the Plan of
Reorganization; provided, however, the Company shall pay any such Claims
secured by liens on real property in full from the Accessible Account Deposit
in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.

(f) Private Letter Rulings. The Private Letter Ruling shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not have been revoked, withdrawn or amended and the
Supplemental Rulings shall have been obtained by the Company from the IRS in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided, however, that (A) a
particular ruling that, in the reasonable determination of Parent covers
substantially the same subject matter as any one or more of the Supplemental
Rulings set forth in Exhibit E shall not be grounds for concluding that the
Supplemental Rulings (collectively) are not reasonably satisfactory to Parent
due to its failure to include such ruling, (B) in the event a specific
Supplemental Ruling set forth in Exhibit E is not given because the IRS
communicates that there is no significant issue with respect to the requested
ruling, the absence of such ruling shall not, standing alone (or collectively)

78 

be grounds for concluding the Supplemental Rulings (collectively) are not
reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided that Parent, and unless waived by
Parent, the Company, obtain an opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel,
in form and substance acceptable to Parent, at a "will" level with respect to
the issue that was initially requested pursuant to the Supplemental Ruling
Request, or (C) a pre-filing agreement (including an agreement in accordance
with Revenue Procedure 2016-30) or closing agreement with the IRS shall be
acceptable in lieu of such specific Supplemental Ruling set forth in Exhibit
E; provided that such agreement is both (i) binding on the IRS to the same
degree as a private letter ruling or is otherwise acceptable to Parent in its
reasonable discretion, and (ii) contains, in the reasonable determination of
Parent conclusions that are substantially similar, and have substantially the
same practical effect, to those contained in the specific rulings initially
requested pursuant to the Supplemental Ruling Requests.

and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall, subject to the qualifications
below, be true and correct as of such earlier date) except where any failures
of any such representations and warranties to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not have, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the representations and warranties of the

representations and warranties of Oncor and Oncor Holdings in the Oncor Letter
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects on the date hereof and as

effect. Each of Oncor and Oncor Holdings shall have performed in all material
respects all obligations required to be performed by it under the Oncor Letter
Agreement at or prior to the Closing (other than the obligations in Section 2

notwithstanding anything to the contrary included elsewhere in this Agreement,
no such consent or approval shall, individually or in the aggregate, impose a
Burdensome Condition; and provided further that this condition shall not be
deemed to be satisfied if the Vermont Insurance Approval shall impose any
material, adverse term or condition, order, sanction, or requirement that,
individually or in the aggregate, would, or would be reasonably expected to
have a material and adverse effect on, or change in, the condition (financial
or otherwise), business, assets, liabilities or results of operations (i) of
Oncor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as whole; provided that, for purposes of this clause (ii)

however in the event White and Case LLP is unwilling or unable to provide the
relevant opinion with the requisite degree of certainty set forth in this

degree of certainty from Miller and Chevalier Chartered. In rendering such
opinion, such tax counsel providing the opinion shall be permitted to rely
upon reasonable representations, including a representation that the Company

ARTICLE VIII 
Termination

Section 8.1 Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing, whether before or after the Bankruptcy Court
shall have entered the EFH Confirmation Order, by mutual written consent of
the Company, EFIH, Parent and Merger Sub by action of each of their respective
boards of directors or managers.

Section 8.2 Termination by Either Parent or the Company/EFIH. This Agreement
may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by action of either (x)
Parent, on the one hand, or (y) the Company and EFIH (acting together), on the
other hand:

(a) if the Closing (including the Closing Date Transactions) shall not have
been consummated within two hundred forty (240) days of the date of this
Agreement (including as extended pursuant to this Section 8.2(a), the "Initial
Termination Date"), provided, that, if as of such date any of the FERC
Approval, the PUCT Approval or the Supplemental Rulings shall not have been
obtained (and such approval or the Supplemental Rulings is still capable of
being obtained within ninety (90) days), the Initial Termination Date shall be
extended for ninety (90) days for the purpose of continuing to pursue such
approval or the Supplemental Rulings, unless the Company and EFIH (acting
together) and Parent agree otherwise in writing (the Initial Termination Date
(as extended pursuant to this Section 8.2(a), as applicable) being, the
"Termination Date"), provided, further, that, the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (a) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of (directly or indirectly), or resulted in, the failure of the Closing
to occur on or before the Termination Date;

(b) if any order of any court or other Governmental Entity permanently
restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting, directly
or indirectly, consummation of the Closing Date Transactions shall have become
final and non-appealable; provided, however, that the termination right in
this clause (b) shall not be available if the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (b) shall not have used its reasonable best
efforts (and caused each of its Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates (other
than the Oncor Entities) to use its reasonable best efforts) to contest such
order prior to its becoming permanent if such party (or Subsidiary or
controlled Affiliate) had the right to contest such order; or

(c) if the PUCT issues an order either denying the approval sought in the PUCT
Filing or imposing a Burdensome Condition (which has not been accepted by
Parent) and, within 30 days following the issuance of such order, such order
has not been vacated or materially modified such that upon such vacation or
modification, the PUCT Approval has been obtained.

Section 8.3 Termination by the Company and/or EFIH. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing:


 

--- 
| | 

|

84 

(a) by the Company and EFIH (acting together) if there has been a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent or Merger
Sub in this Agreement, or any such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue after the date of this Agreement, as if, in each such case, such
representation or warranty were required by the Agreement to be true on and as
of each such date between the date hereof and the Closing Date, which breach
or failure of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to be true or
to be performed (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in any
provision of Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 (which for the purpose of such clauses
it shall be assumed such breach is continuing as of the Closing) and (ii)
cannot be, or has not been, cured within thirty (30) Business Days after
Parent's receipt of written notice thereof from the Company or EFIH; provided,
however, that the termination right in this clause (a) shall not apply if
either the Company or EFIH is then in breach of this Agreement in a manner
that would result or has resulted in any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 not being satisfied;

(b) by the Company and EFIH (acting together) if Parent and Merger Sub have
failed to consummate the Closing no later than the date required by Section
1.4; provided, however, that the termination right in this clause (b) shall
not apply if either the Company or EFIH is then in breach of this Agreement in
a manner that would result or has resulted in any of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 not being satisfied;

(c) by the Company and EFIH (acting together) if the Bankruptcy Court enters
an order approving a plan of reorganization not proposed or supported by the
Company or EFIH (and which the Company and EFIH, to the extent requested by
Parent, used commercially reasonable efforts to challenge before the
Bankruptcy Court) that is inconsistent with this Agreement or the Plan of
Reorganization;

(d) by the Company and EFIH (acting together) if the Chapter 11 Cases are
dismissed or converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and
neither such dismissal or conversion contemplates the Closing Date
Transactions; provided, that such dismissal or conversion was not proposed or
supported by the Company or EFIH (and which the Company and EFIH, to the
extent requested by Parent, used commercially reasonable efforts to challenge
before the Bankruptcy Court);

(e) until the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, by the Company if
concurrently with such termination, the Company Board determines in its sole
discretion after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and based on the advice of such counsel, that the
failure to terminate this Agreement is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
provided that a material breach of the Company's or EFIH's obligations under
Section 6.2 has not provided the basis for such determination; or

(f) until the entry of the EFH Confirmation Order, by EFIH if concurrently
with such termination, the board of managers of EFIH determines in its sole
discretion after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and based on the advice of such counsel, that the
failure to terminate this Agreement is inconsistent with

85 

its fiduciary duties; provided that a material breach of the Company's or
EFIH's obligations under Section 6.2 has not provided the basis for such
determination.

Section 8.4 Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing by Parent:

(a) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company and/or EFIH in this Agreement, or any such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, as if, in each such case, such representation or warranty were
required by the Agreement to be true on and as of each such date between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, which breach or failure of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement to be true or to be performed (i) would result
in a failure of a condition set forth in any provision of Section 7.1 or
Section 7.2 (which for the purpose of such clauses it shall be assumed such
breach is continuing as of the Closing), and (ii) cannot be or has not been
cured within thirty (30) Business Days after the Company's or EFIH's receipt
of written notice thereof from Parent; provided, however, that the termination
right in this clause (a) shall not apply if either Parent or Merger Sub is
then in breach of this Agreement or the Oncor Letter Agreement in a manner
that would result or has resulted in any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 not being satisfied;

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Oncor or Oncor Holdings under the Oncor Letter Agreement, or
any such representation or warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, as if, in each such case, such representation or warranty were
required by the Agreement to be true on and as of each such date between the
date hereof and the Closing Date, which breach or failure of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement to be true or to be performed (i) would result
in a failure of a condition set forth in any provision of Section 7.1 or
Section 7.2 (which for the purpose of such clauses it shall be assumed such
breach is continuing as of the Closing) and (ii) cannot be or has not been
cured within thirty (30) Business Days after the Company's, EFIH's, Oncor's
and Oncor Holdings' receipt of written notice thereof from Parent; provided,
however, that the termination right in this clause (b) shall not apply if
either Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of this Agreement or the Oncor
Letter Agreement in a manner that would result or has resulted in any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 not being satisfied;

(c) if the Company and/or EFIH fail to consummate the Closing on or prior to
the date required by Section 1.4; provided, however, that the termination
right in this clause (c) shall not apply if either Parent or Merger Sub is
then in breach of this Agreement or the Oncor Letter Agreement in a manner
that would result or has resulted in the failure to consummate the Closing;

(d) if the Company or EFIH files or expressly supports in the Bankruptcy Court
a plan of reorganization that is inconsistent in any substantive legal or
economic respect with this Agreement and the Plan of Reorganization and such
inconsistency cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) Business Days
after the Company's or EFIH's receipt

86 

of written notice thereof from Parent (which notice must occur within five (5)
Business Days of the filing of such Plan);

(e) if the Bankruptcy Court enters an order, or if the Company or EFIH files a
motion seeking entry of an order, approving any sale or other disposition
(other than a sale or other disposition permitted by this Agreement) of (i)
any material portion of the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii)
any equity interests in EFIH or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Oncor

respective Affiliates;

(f) if a trustee is appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to Section 1104

(g) if any Chapter 11 Case, other than the cases relating to (i) LSGT Gas

is not filed with the Bankruptcy Court by August 28, 2017;

(ii) the Bankruptcy Court does not enter the Approval Order by September 30,

indication by the Bankruptcy Court that it is approving or will approve the
E-Side Debtors' entry into and performance and agreement under this Agreement,
including but not limited to payment and satisfaction of the Termination Fee
pursuant to the terms hereof (such entry or deemed entry of the Approval
Order, the "Approval Order Entry");

(iii) the Bankruptcy Court does not enter the Disclosure Statement Order by
September 30, 2017; provided, that, entry of such order shall be deemed to

87 

(i) if Parent, Merger Sub, Oncor and Oncor Holdings fail to enter into the
Oncor Letter Agreement within five (5) days following the date hereof;
provided, however, that if Parent has not terminated this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.4(i) within ten (10) days following the end of such five (5)
day period, this Section 8.4(i) shall be of no further force and effect and
Parent shall have no such right to terminate this Agreement.

Section 8.5 Effect of Termination and Abandonment.

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article
VIII, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect and
no party shall have any liability to any other party hereto (or of any of its
Representatives or Affiliates) with respect hereto; provided, however, and
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that, (i) this
Section 8.5 and the provisions set forth in the second sentence of Section 9.1
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the parties hereto may
have further liability with respect thereto, and (ii) liability may exist for
willful or intentional breaches of this Agreement (where willful or
intentional breach means a breach of this Agreement by a party that has actual
knowledge that its action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to
breach this Agreement) by a party prior to the time of such termination and,
in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, any failure to have sufficient
immediately available funds at the Closing for the consummation of the Closing
Date Transactions (which liability the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs).

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.3(e), Section
8.3(f), Section 8.4(a), Section 8.4(d) or Section 8.4(e), and any alternative
transaction is consummated (including pursuant to any Chapter 7 proceedings or
any transaction or proceeding that permits the E-Side Debtors that are the
direct or indirect owners of Oncor Holdings to emerge from the Chapter 11
Cases) pursuant to which none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates will obtain direct or indirect ownership of 100% of Oncor Holdings
and Oncor Holdings' approximately 80% equity interest in Oncor, then, if the
Approval Order has been entered, no later than five (5) days following the
consummation of such alternative transaction, the Company and EFIH shall pay
to Parent the Termination Fee (as defined below), by wire transfer, as
directed by Parent, in immediately available funds. In the event the Company
and EFIH pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), such payment
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company, EFIH and their respective Affiliates, Representatives, creditors or
shareholders with respect to any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. If the Approval Order has been entered, the Company's and EFIH's
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. If the Approval Order has been
entered, the Termination Fee shall constitute an administrative expense of the
Company and EFIH under the Bankruptcy Code. "Termination Fee" shall mean an
amount equal to $190,000,000, inclusive of all expense reimbursements,
including reasonable and documented professional fees of Parent and Merger
Sub; provided that, in no event shall such claim be senior or pari passu with
the superpriority administrative

claims granted to the secured parties pursuant to the DIP Facility (as in
effect on the date hereof).

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
enter into this Agreement.

consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section

Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

Section 9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including any exhibits or
schedules hereto including as actually executed), the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Oncor Letter Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
August 10, 2017, by and among Parent, the Company and EFIH (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") and the other agreements named herein constitute
the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and cancel, merge and supersede all other prior or contemporaneous
oral or written agreements, understandings, representations and warranties
both written and oral, among the parties hereto, with respect to the subject
matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ONCOR LETTER AGREEMENT,
NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MAKES ANY
OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR
COMPLETENESS

OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION, MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY, ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE
OTHER'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

Section 9.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.8,
Parent, Merger Sub, EFIH and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein, except for the rights of the Financing Sources pursuant to
this Section 9.8, Section 9.2, Section 9.5 and Section 9.16 (who are intended
third party beneficiaries thereunder and are intended to be the only third
party beneficiaries thereunder). The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.8 shall not arise unless
and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.9 Obligations of Parent. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of Parent, including Merger Sub, to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to
cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

Section 9.10 Remedies. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed by
the Company, EFIH, Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with the terms hereof
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. As a result, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII, each party shall be entitled to specific performance to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and of the terms hereof (including the obligation
to consummate the Closing Date Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated herein, subject to the terms and conditions hereof), without
proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy) in addition to
any other remedy at law or equity. The parties hereto further agree not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach. The parties acknowledge the Company's right to (i) seek
specific performance and (ii) to cause Parent and Merger Sub to sue and
enforce against the Financing Sources, but with respect to clause (ii), only
to the extent Parent or Merger Sub have such a right under the Debt Commitment
Letter.

Section 9.11 Transfer Taxes. To the extent payable under applicable Law
(notwithstanding section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code), all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and
fees (including penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger
shall be paid by the Surviving Company when due.

Section 9.12 Definitions. Each term set forth in the Table of Defined Terms is
defined on the page of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

Section 9.13 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.14 Interpretation; Construction.

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a section or exhibit, such reference shall be to a
section of or exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Such
exhibits are an integral part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The term "made available" and words of similar import means that the relevant
documents, instruments or materials were either (i) posted and made available
to the other party or its designated Representatives on the Intralinks due
diligence data site maintained by the Company for purposes of the
transaction(s) contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) sent to the other party or
its representatives directly, or (iii) publicly available by virtue of the
relevant party's filing of a publicly available final registration statement,
prospectus, report, form, schedule or definitive proxy statement filed with
the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, in each case, at
least five (5) Business Days prior to the date hereof or such prior date with
respect to which such documents, instruments or materials were represented by
a party to have been made available to the other party. The words "shall" and
"will" have the same meaning; provided, that this sentence shall not apply to
the portions of Section 7.1(c), Section 7.2(e), Section 7.3(c) and Exhibit E
describing the levels of comfort required with respect to the various tax
opinions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises,

|

94 

this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto,
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

(c) Subject to the first paragraphs of Sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively,
each of the Company, EFIH, Parent and Merger Sub has, or may have, set forth
information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement.

Section 9.15 Assignment; Successors. This Agreement shall not be assignable by
operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the non-
assigning parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Any purported assignment in violation of this
Agreement is void. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns
(including any Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 trustee, any successor trustee, and the
estates of any or all of the Debtors).

Section 9.16 Financing Sources Arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) Company and its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members, stockholders or representatives shall not have any rights or claims
against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or the Debt Financing (whether directly
or by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Parent against any Financing
Source) or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing, or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, (b) no Financing Source shall
have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company,
and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members, stockholders or representatives for any
obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or the
Debt Financing or for any claim (whether directly or by or through a claim by
or on behalf of the Parent against any Financing Source) based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise and (c) the Company and its Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents partners, managers, members,
stockholders and representatives agree not to commence (and if commenced agree
to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to assist) any Action against any
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
provided, however, that claims or causes of action related to an act or
omission that is determined by a court of competition jurisdiction to have
constituted fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence shall not be waived
by this Section 9.16. The provisions of this Section 9.16 shall inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, each Financing Source, its Affiliates and
their respective successors and permitted

95 

assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third party
beneficiary of this Section 9.16.

Re: Oncor Letter Agreement

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated August
21, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among (i) Energy Future Holdings
Corp., a Texas corporation (the "Company"), (ii) Energy Future Intermediate
Holding Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("EFIH"), (iii)
Sempra Energy ("Parent") and (iv) Power Play Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Merger Sub" and, together with Parent, "Purchasers"), which
agreement has been approved by the board of directors of the Company, the
board of managers of EFIH, the board of directors of Parent and the board of
directors of Merger Sub and will be submitted for approval by the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court").
In addition, reference is made to the amended Plan of Reorganization (the
"Plan of Reorganization") attached to the Merger Agreement and filed or to be
filed with the Bankruptcy Court on or about the date hereof by Purchasers, the
Company, EFIH and other Debtors (as defined below) in connection with the
Chapter 11 Cases (as defined below), which, among other things, provided for
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Upon the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, among other things, Purchasers plan to
acquire, pursuant to certain transactions described therein (the "Purchase"),
direct or indirect equity interests in the Company and EFIH that indirectly
represent all of the outstanding equity interests in Oncor Electric Delivery
Holdings Company LLC ("Oncor Holdings") and at least 80.03% of the outstanding
equity interests in Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC ("Oncor" and, together
with Oncor Holdings and their respective Subsidiaries, the "Oncor Entities").
A full and complete copy of the Merger Agreement (including the Plan of
Reorganization, which is attached as an exhibit thereto) has been provided to
Oncor Holdings and Oncor.

WHEREAS, the Oncor Entities are "ring-fenced" from the Company and EFIH and
their respective Affiliates (as defined below), as a result of which, among
other things, (i) the boards of directors of Oncor Holdings and Oncor are
comprised of a majority of independent directors and (ii) certain arrangements
are in place to maintain the separateness of the business and operations of
the Company and EFIH from the business and operations of the Oncor Entities
(such limitations collectively, the "Ring-Fence");

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the Purchase and in light of the Ring-Fence, the
Order on Rehearing entered in PUCT Docket No. 34077, the limited liability
company agreements (as amended) of Oncor Holdings and Oncor (the "LLC
Agreements"), the 2007 Separation Agreement (as defined below) and the
Investor Rights Agreement (as defined below), the Company and EFIH have
requested that Oncor Holdings and Oncor enter into this letter agreement
("Letter Agreement") and have provided their prior written consent

transactions or commitments proposed by the Purchasers, (ii) are not parties
to or bound by the Merger Agreement and (iii) have not approved and are not

WHEREAS, Oncor and Purchasers will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate
with Purchasers in the preparation of any filings and in appearances made
before the PUCT, as appropriate, in support of Purchasers' proposal to acquire
Oncor and Oncor Holdings, and Purchasers, Oncor and Oncor Holdings agree to
use reasonable best efforts to make a single filing by the parties seeking
prior approval by the PUCT of the Purchase Transaction;

WHEREAS, Oncor Holdings and Oncor have agreed to operate in the ordinary
course of business and materially consistent with the 2017-2018 Plan upon

WHEREAS, in exchange for the agreements of Oncor Holdings and Oncor in this
Letter Agreement, Purchasers have agreed to certain commitments set forth
herein with respect to the implications of the Purchase Transaction for Oncor
Holdings, Oncor and their employees;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties,

or Oncor to perform the actions contemplated by, and to fulfill its
obligations under, this Letter Agreement.

(b) Corporate Authority. Oncor Holdings and Oncor have each approved by all
necessary limited liability company action the execution and delivery of this

(c) No Conflicts. As of the date hereof, the execution, delivery and
performance by Oncor Holdings and Oncor of this Letter Agreement does not and

under, or otherwise contravene or conflict with, the certificate of formation
of Oncor or Oncor Holdings, the LLC Agreements or the comparable governing
documents of any other Oncor Entity (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time

or knowingly induce, the submission of, any Alternative Proposal; provided,
however, that an Oncor Entity may interact with its equityholders in order to
satisfy its fiduciary obligations and its obligations pursuant to the LLC
Agreements and the Investor Rights Agreement and may, in response to
communications from (without otherwise limiting the provisions of this Section
4) any of its direct equityholders or any third party who makes or seeks to
make an unsolicited Alternative Proposal, make available public and non-public
information (but only if such equityholder or third party has executed a
confidentially agreement with Oncor on terms no less favorable in the
aggregate to the Oncor Entities than terms of the Confidentiality Agreement)

to the Purchasers), (ii) enter into, maintain or continue negotiations with
any Person with respect to, any Alternative Proposal, or (iii) enter into any

and Oncor shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status and material details (including material modifications) of any
Alternative Proposal. During the Interim Period, neither Oncor Holdings nor
Oncor shall enter into any agreement with any Person which prohibits any Oncor
Entity from providing information to the Purchasers that they are expressly
entitled to receive from Oncor Holdings or Oncor in accordance with this
Section 4(a); provided, that for all purposes of this Letter Agreement, the
reasonable best efforts of Oncor Holdings and Oncor shall not include the
expenditure of any fees or expenses or the undertaking of, or response to, any
action, suit, claim, cause of action or other form of litigation.

(b) As of the date the Bankruptcy Court has entered an order approving entry
into the Merger Agreement, Oncor Holdings and Oncor represent that as of such
date, they are not in negotiations with any Person with respect to any
Alternative Proposal and that there is no agreement that would prevent Oncor
Holdings or Oncor from complying with their respective obligations under
Section 4(a).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4(a), any of
Oncor Holdings and Oncor and their Subsidiaries may, but only upon the request
of the Company or EFIH, (i) negotiate with stakeholders of the Debtors,

regarding support for and/or financing of such Permitted Alternative Proposal;
provided, however, that other than any required disclosure to the Purchasers

confidential any solicitation, negotiation, facilitation, and documentation by
the applicable Oncor Entities of a Permitted Alternative Proposal and (y) to
enter into confidentiality agreements with any counterparty to any agreement
regarding support for and/or financing of a Permitted Alternative Proposal,
which confidentiality agreement provides that the existence and terms of such
Alternative Proposal shall be kept confidential and shall not be publicly
disclosed, except in each case to the extent required by applicable Law or
pursuant to such

| | 

|

6 

confidentiality agreements (including any "cleansing" provisions set forth in
such confidentiality agreements) as determined by the applicable Oncor
Entities in their sole and absolute discretion.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4(c), such
provisions shall not be construed to permit, and Oncor Holdings and Oncor and
their Subsidiaries shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives
not to, make or support any filings with or submissions or inquiries to any
Governmental Entity, including the PUCT, the FCC and the FERC, or make or
support any public statements with respect to any Alternative Proposal or any
Permitted Alternative Proposal at any time during the Interim Period;
provided, however, that the Oncor Entities and their Representatives may (i)

Permitted Alternative Proposal. The Oncor Entities shall, unless otherwise
prohibited by Law, provide prompt notice to the Purchasers of any requests,
communications or directives received by them of the type described in clause

prompt basis of material developments in connection therewith to the extent
not prohibited by applicable Law or confidentiality agreements with third
parties.

(e) For purposes of this Letter Agreement:

(i) "Alternative Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal, expression of interest
or offer from or by a Person other than the Purchasers or their respective

or negotiations with one or more third parties and (ii) certifying that, in

the Merger Agreement.

to comply with any requirement, or reasonable request without solicitation, in
a Governmental Request or Order; provided, that, as applicable, each party

shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent information in its control
concerning its business, properties, facilities, operations and personnel as
Parent reasonably requests, in each case solely to the extent reasonably
necessary to effect the Purchase Transaction; provided that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6 shall (a) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of any Oncor Entity or (b) affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by an Oncor Entity herein; and provided,
further, that the foregoing shall not require any Oncor Entity to (i) permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of such Oncor Entity would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets or other confidential information of third parties or violate any of
its or any of its Subsidiaries' obligations with respect to confidentiality if
such Oncor Entity shall have used reasonable best efforts to furnish such
information in a manner that does not result in any such disclosure or
violation, including obtaining the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure, (ii) disclose any privileged information of the
Oncor Entities if such Oncor Entity shall have used reasonable best efforts to
furnish such information in a manner that does not result in the loss of such

Applications to be mutually agreed and executed between the applicable
parties), (iii) permit any invasive environmental investigation or sampling,
including a Phase II environmental assessment or (iv) require disclosure of

with such retirement or termination, treating such retirement or termination
as a resignation with "good reason," a termination "without cause," or a

Purchase Closing Date and is subsequently hired, such service will only be
credited to the extent such service would have been credited and/or restored

the Purchase Closing Date, or (ii) to the extent that it would result in (A) a
duplication of benefits, (B) benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan (other than utilizing such years of service in order to satisfy
any requirements for future benefit accrual only under any defined benefit
pension plan), or (C) service accrual for any purpose under any post-
retirement welfare benefit plan).

(g) The provisions of this Section 8 are solely for the benefit of the parties
to this Letter Agreement, and no Oncor Employee or former Oncor Employee or
any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as
a third party beneficiary of this Letter Agreement, and nothing herein shall
(i) be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any purpose, (ii)
give any Oncor Employee or former Oncor Employee or any other individual
associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any
other third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 8 or
(iii) obligate the Surviving Company, EFIH, Oncor Holdings or Oncor or any of
their respective Affiliates (A) to, subject to Section 8(a)(iii), and as
provided in the Split Participant Agreement (as defined below), maintain any
particular benefit plan, (B) to retain the

Section 10.Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) Nothing herein shall impair or restrict the ability of any Oncor Entity to
honor and perform any of its indemnification obligations to any Representative
under any Contract.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor
shall, and the Surviving Company and EFIH shall exercise all rights as a
direct or indirect equityholder of Oncor Holdings and Oncor to cause Oncor
Holdings and Oncor to comply with (i) any indemnification agreement between
any Indemnified Party and an Oncor Entity and (ii) the indemnification
obligations and exculpation provisions in the LLC Agreements as in effect as
of the date hereof.

(c) Nothing contained in this Letter Agreement shall be construed to prohibit
the Oncor Entities from obtaining, with the approval of their respective
boards of directors, and fully paying the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Oncor Entities' existing
directors', managers' and officers' insurance policies, and (ii) Oncor's
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Purchase Closing Date with respect to any claim related to any period of time
at or prior to the Purchase Closing Date, which policies may be issued by an
insurance carrier selected by the Oncor Entities and may contain terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are acceptable to the
Oncor Entities in their sole discretion with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of any of the Oncor
Entities by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Purchase Closing Date (including in connection
with this Letter Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); provided, that, the premiums for the extension of such insurance
policies shall not exceed 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Oncor Entities for such insurance policies.

(d) If, within six (6) years of the Purchase Closing Date, the Surviving
Company, EFIH or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Company, EFIH or their successors or assigns shall make, to the
extent not provided for under applicable Law, proper provisions so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Company or EFIH, as the case may be,
assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Company or EFIH set forth in
this Section 10.

(e) The provisions of this Section 10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 10 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of formation, operating agreement or comparable governing documents of any
Oncor Entity, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or

prior to the Purchase Closing Date and rights to advancement of expenses
relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in
the certificate of formation, operating agreement or comparable governing
documents of any Oncor Entity or the Company or any existing indemnification
agreement between such Indemnified Party and any of the foregoing shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Purchase Closing Date.

(g) To the extent that any Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
under both this Letter Agreement and any other contract, agreement or
instrument (including the certificate of formation, operating agreement or
comparable governing documents of any Oncor Entity or the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and any of the
foregoing) in respect of any services performed by such Indemnified Party as a
director, manager, or officer of any of the Oncor Entities, the fact that any
such contract, agreement or instrument also provides for indemnification of
such Indemnified Parties shall not (i) be construed to diminish or otherwise
limit any right or remedy granted to such Indemnified Parties hereunder or
(ii) require that any other sources of indemnification or available insurance
be primary over the indemnification obligations set forth in this Letter
Agreement, any indemnification agreement previously entered with the
Indemnified Parties or in the organizational documents of any Oncor Entity.

any indemnity in connection with the Financing or their performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 12 or any information utilized in
connection therewith. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Oncor
Entities and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
Costs suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and the performance of their respective obligations under this

interruption duration index ("SAIDI") and system average interruption
frequency index ("SAIFI") standards should be calculated for Oncor's current

employed on the closing date will be provided; (a) a base salary or wage rate
no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such employee
immediately prior to the closing date; (b) aggregate incentive compensation
opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those

governed by the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, as
may be modified from time to time. 

|

37.

|

with its existing code of conduct. 

|

38.

|

Commission Jurisdiction. Oncor and Oncor Holdings will not own, operate, or
construct capital assets outside of ERCOT without prior approval from the
Commission or take any other action that would impair the Commission's
regulatory jurisdiction. Neither Oncor, Oncor Holdings, Parent nor their
respective affiliates will take any action that would subject ERCOT assets to
the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC");
provided, however, that FERC continues to have jurisdiction under sections
210, 211, and 212 of the Federal Power Act ("FPA") and may direct transmission
and interconnection services over certain existing facilities outside of
ERCOT; provided further that the existing reliability and critical
infrastructure standards administered by the North American Electric

|

Goodwill. Any costs of goodwill of Parent or its affiliates (including the
pre-existing goodwill recognized by Oncor) will not be included in rate base,
cost of capital, or operating expenses in future Oncor ratemaking proceedings.
Write-downs or write-offs of goodwill will not be included in the calculation
of net income for dividend payment purposes. 

| 
---|--- 

41.

|

Pushdown Accounting. Parent will not elect to apply pushdown accounting for
the merger, i.e., the merger will have no impact on Oncor's assets being
acquired; and any incremental goodwill will not be allocated to, or recognized
within, Oncor's balance sheet. 

| 
---|--- 

42.

|

Tangible and Quantifiable Benefits. At a minimum, Oncor will provide the
following tangible and quantifiable benefits associated with the merger. Oncor
will provide monthly bill credits to electric delivery rates for ultimate
credits to customers in an amount equal to 90% of any interest rate savings
achieved until: final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate case after the
Oncor base rate case currently filed. Savings will not be included in credits
if already realized in rates. Interest Rate Savings refers to the improvement
in Oncor's borrowing costs post-close relative to those costs as of June 30,
2017 due to improvement in credit ratings and/or improvement in market
spreads. Until final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate case after the
Oncor base rate case that is currently filed, Oncor will file a report with
the Commission every six months detailing any interest rate savings determined
by the amount of debt issued by Oncor by at least 0.15% (amounts above 0.15%
being based on actual interest rate savings by Oncor) and demonstrating a
calculation of the credit. Parent and Oncor agree to work in good faith with
interested parties, including TXU Energy Retail Company LLC, Texas Energy
Association for Marketers, Alliance for Retail Markets, and NRG Companies, to
determine an acceptable method for implementation of any bill credit to
effectuate this commitment, as approved by the Commission. At a minimum, Oncor
shall provide retail electric providers 45-day notice of the amount of any
customer credits (e.g., for each customer class, the amount per kwh or per-
customer credit that would apply) prior to the effective date of the credits
and shall implement updated bill credits simultaneously with other changes in
Oncor's rates. In addition, one year after closing, Oncor will present a
merger synergy savings analysis to the Commission and provide monthly bill
credits to electric rates for inclusion in customer bills in an 

amount equal to 90% of any synergy savings until final rates are set in the
next Oncor base rate proceeding, in which any total synergy savings shall be
reflected in Oncor's rates.

| 
---|--- 

43.

|

LLC Agreements. The Oncor Holdings and Oncor LLC Agreements shall be amended
to the extent necessary to effect all of the commitments herein. 

| 
---|--- 

44.

|

Competitive Shopping Platforms. Parent agrees that neither Oncor nor Oncor\'s
subsidiaries will host or allow the Oncor name, trademark, brand, logo, or
other identifying brand features to be used to promote a competitive retail
electric shopping website.

provided, however, that FERC continues to have jurisdiction under sections
210, 211, and 212 of the Federal Power Act ("FPA") and may direct transmission
and interconnection services over certain existing facilities outside of

of net income for dividend payment purposes. 

| 
---|---

Tangible and Quantifiable Benefits. At a minimum, Oncor will provide the
following tangible and quantifiable benefits associated with the merger. Oncor
will provide monthly bill credits to electric delivery rates for ultimate
credits to customers in an amount equal to 90% of any interest rate savings
achieved until: final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate case after the
Oncor base rate case currently filed. Savings will not be included in credits
if already realized in rates. Interest Rate Savings refers to the improvement
in Oncor's borrowing costs post-close relative to those costs as of June 30,
2017 due to improvement in credit ratings and/or improvement in market
spreads. Until final rates are set in the next Oncor base rate case after the
Oncor base rate case that is currently filed, Oncor will file a report with
the Commission every six months detailing any interest rate savings determined
by the amount of debt issued by Oncor by at least 0.15% (amounts above 0.15%
being based on actual interest rate savings by Oncor) and demonstrating a
calculation of the credit. Parent 

 

and Oncor agree to work in good faith with interested parties, including TXU
Energy Retail Company LLC, Texas Energy Association for Marketers, Alliance
for Retail Markets, and NRG Companies, to determine an acceptable method for
implementation of any bill credit to effectuate this commitment, as approved
by the Commission. At a minimum, Oncor shall provide retail electric providers
45-day notice of the amount of any customer credits (e.g., for each customer
class, the amount per kwh or per-customer credit that would apply) prior to
the effective date of the credits and shall implement updated bill credits
simultaneously with other changes in Oncor's rates. In addition, one year
after closing, Oncor will present a merger synergy savings analysis to the
Commission and provide monthly bill credits to electric rates for inclusion in
customer bills in an amount equal to 90% of any synergy savings until final
rates are set in the next Oncor base rate proceeding, in which any total
synergy savings shall be reflected in Oncor's rates.

other identifying brand features to be used to promote a competitive retail
electric shopping website.

|

Equity Commitment. Parent agrees to work in good faith with the other
beneficial owners of Power Play BidCo LLC and Oncor's other members so that,
as promptly as practicable and in no event later than 180 days after closing

achieve an equity to debt ratio to enable Oncor to achieve a capital structure

Approval of Stipulation, Proposed Final Order, and Tariffs (Aug. 2, 2017).
