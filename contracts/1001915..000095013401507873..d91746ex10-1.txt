<PAGE>


             (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.1(b), (c) and (d)
requiring the Subsequent Payments to be paid in cash, with regard to any
Subsequent Payments due prior to the completion of a Qualified Financing, ILEX
may, at its option, make up to (x) fifty percent (50%) of the Subsequent Payment
required under Section 3.1(b) and (y) sixty-three percent (63%) (inclusive of
the amounts set forth in Section 3.2(c)) of any such Subsequent Payment required
under Sections 3.1(c) and (d) in shares of ILEX Stock in lieu of cash (the
"Stock Consideration"); provided that (i) the resale of such ILEX Stock must be
registered under an effective registration statement on Form S-3 under the
Securities Act as of the date of such issuance; (ii) as of the time of such
issuance, the ILEX Stock shall continue to be listed on Nasdaq; (iii) on the
date of issuance, trading in ILEX Stock shall not have been suspended, other
than a temporary suspension of trading to provide for an orderly market; (iv)
ILEX shall be current in its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act; (v)
such issuance would not cause the MLNM Parties and their Affiliates to hold in
excess of 19.9% of the ILEX Stock then outstanding; and (vi) no action, suit or
proceeding shall be pending or threatened before any court or quasi-judicial or
administrative agency of any federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction or
before any arbitrator wherein an unfavorable injunction, judgment, order,

(B) cause any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be rescinded
following consummation (and no such injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling
or charge shall be in effect); (vii) ILEX shall have delivered to Seller a

waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the HSR Act shall have
expired or otherwise been terminated and the Parties shall have received all
other authorizations, consents and approvals of any Governmental Authority
required in connection with the issuance of the ILEX Stock. The number of shares
of ILEX Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 3.2(b) in lieu of a cash portion
of a Subsequent Payment shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the
cash amount of such portion of a Subsequent Payment by the Market Price of ILEX
Stock on the date such Subsequent Payment is to be paid. ILEX shall provide
Seller with forty-five (45) days' advance notice of its intent to pay any
portion of a Subsequent Payment in shares of ILEX Stock and the amount of such
portion to be paid in ILEX stock and shall issue such shares of ILEX Stock in
the name of the Trust or a designee named by Seller provided any such designee
shall deliver an officer's certificate to ILEX setting forth equivalent
representations and warranties as set forth in Section 4.7 hereof.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event ILEX merges with or into another entity,
sells all or substantially all of its assets or, directly or indirectly, sells
or assigns, all or substantially all of its rights to the Product or all or
substantially all of its right to receive revenues or profits based on sales of
the Product, then ILEX shall lose the ability provided in Sections 3.2(b) or
3.2(c) to make any portion of any Subsequent Payment in equity.

ILEX, up to 25% of the payments due in Section 3.1(c) can be made by ILEX, at
its option, in shares of ILEX Stock in lieu of cash. Notwithstanding the
completion of a Qualified Financing by ILEX, up to 25% of the payments due in
Section 3.1(d) can be made by ILEX, at its option, in shares of ILEX Stock in
lieu of cash; provided, that all the conditions precedent to the issuance of
Stock Consideration set forth in Section 3.2(b) shall have been met. The number
of shares of ILEX Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 3.2(c) in lieu of a
cash portion of a Subsequent Payment shall be equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing the cash amount of such portion of a


                                      -8-
<PAGE>


Subsequent Payment by the Market Price of ILEX Stock on the date such Subsequent
Payment is to be paid.

         3.3 Sales Reports; Payments. Within sixty (60) days after the end of

applicable payment under Section 3.1(e). Concurrently with such report ILEX
shall pay to the Seller all payments payable by it under Section 3.1(e) as
indicated in the report.

         3.4 Audits. The ILEX Parties shall keep complete and accurate records
of the underlying Net Sales data relating to the reports and payments required
by Sections 3.1, and 3.3. The Seller shall have the right once annually at its

Seller, review any such records of the ILEX Parties and the Partnership in the
location(s) where such records are maintained by the ILEX Parties and the
Partnership upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours and subject
to the obligations of confidence provided in Article 11, for the sole purpose of
verifying the basis and accuracy of payments made under Sections 3.1 and 3.2, in
each case within the prior three (3) year period. If the review of such records
reveals that the ILEX Parties have failed to accurately report information
pursuant to Sections 3.2 or 3.3, then the ILEX Parties shall promptly pay to the
Seller any resulting amounts due under Sections 3.1 or 3.2, together with
interest calculated in the manner provided in Section 3.6. If any amounts due
under Sections 3.1 or 3.2 as a result of such audit are greater than five
percent (5%) of the amounts actually due for a calendar year under Section 3.1
or 3.2, as applicable, the ILEX Parties shall pay the reasonable costs of such
review.

         3.5 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.1 or
3.2, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of ILEX Stock shall
be issued to the Trust. In the event that the Trust shall be entitled to any
fractional share interest, then any fractional amount shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole share.

         3.6 Late Payments. The Purchaser shall pay interest to the Seller on
the aggregate amount of any payments that are not paid on or before the date
such payments are due under this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the
lesser of the prime rate of interest plus two percent (2%), as reported by The
Wall Street Journal, or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, calculated
on the number of days such payments are paid after the date such payments are
due.

decrees of all Governmental Authorities applicable to it that relate to its
respective business, and none of the ILEX Parties has received any notice

to permit it to issue the number of shares of ILEX Stock which may be issued

irrevocable, fully paid up license to use any Intellectual Property to make,
have made, use, sell, have sold or import Product. In the event Seller becomes
aware of any new Intellectual Property at any time during the seven (7) year
period following the Closing Date, Seller shall inform ILEX in writing of the
scope and nature of the new Intellectual Property, in sufficient detail to give
ILEX full technical understanding of the same; and if ILEX desires access to the

             (b) all records and documents in its possession or control relating

         10. REGISTRATION RIGHTS.


                                      -20-
<PAGE>


         10.1 Registration. Prior to issuing any Stock Consideration to Seller,
ILEX will file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor to Form
S-3) with the Commission and such applications or other filings as required
under applicable state securities or blue sky laws sufficient to permit the
resale of the Stock Consideration to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act, and shall cause such registration statement
to be declared effective so that the resale of the Stock Consideration will be
registered for the offering on such Form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ILEX
shall not be obligated to effect a registration (a) in any particular
jurisdiction in which ILEX would be required to execute a general consent to
service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance
unless ILEX is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may
be required by the Securities Act; or (b) if ILEX shall furnish to Seller a
certificate signed by the President of ILEX stating that in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of ILEX the filing of a registration
statement would require the disclosure of material information that ILEX has a
bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential and that is not then
otherwise required to be disclosed, then ILEX's obligation to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement shall be
deferred for a period not to exceed 180 days from the date of such notice;
provided, however, that the right not to effect a registration of the Stock
Consideration pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall not be exercised by ILEX more
than once.

         10.2 Registration Procedures and Expenses. As provided in Section 10.1
hereof, ILEX shall, use its commercially reasonable efforts to do each of the
following:

             (a) subject to the limitations under Section 10.1 hereof, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to remain
effective for two years as provided herein;

             (b) cooperate with Seller and any underwriter who shall sell the
Stock Consideration in connection with their review of ILEX made in connection
with such registration, and in the case of any underwritten offering of the
Stock Consideration, enter into and perform its obligations under an indemnity
agreement in usual and customary form;

             (c) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements
to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith
as may be necessary to keep such registration statement effective until the
earlier to occur of the sale of all of the Stock Consideration by Seller or the
second anniversary of the effectiveness of the registration statement, and to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, with
respect to the disposition of all the Stock Consideration covered by such
registration statement for such period;

             (d) furnish to Seller such number of copies of the prospectus
forming a part of such registration statement (including each preliminary
prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such
other documents as Seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Stock Consideration;

             (e) notify Seller, at any time when the registration statement or
any amendment thereto or any prospectus relating to the Stock Consideration is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event
as a result of which such registration statement or prospectus forming a part of
such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state any material fact required


                                      -21-
<PAGE>


to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
in the light of the circumstances then existing, as promptly as practicable
prepare and file with the Commission, and furnish to Seller a reasonable number
of copies of, such supplement to or amendment of such registration statement or
prospectus that may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of the Stock Consideration, such registration statement or prospectus
shall not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing;

             (f) notify Seller (i) when such registration statement, or any
post-effective amendment to such registration statement, shall have become
effective, or any amendment of or supplement to the prospectus used in
connection therewith shall have been filed, (ii) of any request by the SEC to
amend such registration statement or to amend or supplement such prospectus or
for additional information, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or of any order
preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation
or threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes and (iv) of the
suspension of the qualification of such securities for the offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or of the institution of any proceedings for any such
purposes; and

             (g) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the lifting
of any stop order that might be issued suspending the effectiveness of such
registration statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of any
preliminary prospectus.

         10.3 Agreement by Seller. In the event that Seller participates,
pursuant to this Article 10, in the offering of the Stock Consideration, such
Seller shall:

             (a) furnish ILEX all material information reasonably requested by
ILEX concerning Seller and the proposed method of sale or other disposition of
the Stock Consideration and such other information and undertakings as shall be
reasonably required in connection with the preparation and filing of the
registration statement covering the Stock Consideration in order to ensure full
compliance with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder; and

             (b) make no further sales or other dispositions, or offers
therefor, of the Stock Consideration under such registration statement if,
during the effectiveness of such registration statement, ILEX shall have
notified Seller that an intervening event has occurred which, in the opinion of
counsel to ILEX, makes the prospectus included in such registration statement no
longer comply with the Securities Act, until such time as Seller has received
from ILEX copies of a new, amended or supplemented prospectus complying with the
Securities Act, which prospectus shall be delivered to Seller by ILEX as soon as
practicable after the filing of such new, amended or supplemented prospectus.

         10.4 Allocation of Expenses. ILEX shall pay the costs and expenses in
connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to this
Article 10, including, without limitation, all registration, listing and
qualifications fees, printers and accounting fees; provided, however, that
Seller shall pay its own attorneys' fees, all underwriting discounts, selling
commissions and stock transfer taxes attributable to the Stock Consideration
under such registration statement.

         10.5 Indemnification.

              (a) Upon the registration of any of the Stock Consideration under
the Securities Act pursuant to Article 10 hereof, Seller shall indemnify and
hold harmless ILEX, each director and officer of ILEX, each underwriter, if any,
and any Person who controls ILEX or such underwriter within the meaning of
Section 5 of the Securities Act, and ILEX's accountants and legal counsel,
against all expenses, claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof) including any of the foregoing incurred in
settlement of any commenced or threatened litigation, arising out of or based
upon any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of any material fact, or
omission (or alleged omission) of any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (a "Violation"), if such
statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to ILEX or its underwriter by or on behalf of
Seller specifically for use therein, provided that the indemnity agreement
contained in this Section 10.5(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement
of any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is
effected without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and provided further that in no event shall the amounts payable in
indemnity by Seller under this Section 10.5(a) exceed the net proceeds received
by Seller in the registered offering out of which such Violation arises.

              (b) Upon the registration of any of the Stock Consideration under
the Securities Act pursuant to Article 10 hereof, ILEX will indemnify Seller and
each underwriter, if any, and each person who controls any underwriter within
the meaning of Section 5 of the Securities Act, against all expenses, claims,
losses, damages and liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof),
including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of any commenced or
threatened litigation, arising out of or based upon any Violation, provided that
ILEX will not be liable to indemnify Seller or an underwriter in any such case
to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out
of or is based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement
or omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
in writing to ILEX by or on behalf of Seller or an underwriter specifically for
use therein, provided that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section
10.5(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim, loss,
damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the consent
of ILEX, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

              (c) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 10.5
(the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the Indemnifying
Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation shall be
approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be
withheld). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party may withhold its consent to any such counsel who also acts as counsel to
the Indemnifying Party (with respect to such claim or otherwise) if the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes that there exists a conflict of interest
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, with respect to such
claim or litigation. In such event, the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
expense of another counsel who


                                      -23-
<PAGE>


shall represent the Indemnified Party and any other persons or entities who have
indemnification rights from the Indemnifying Party hereunder, with respect to
such claim or litigation, and shall be selected as provided in the first
sentence of this Section 10.5(c). The Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at such party's expense (except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is required to pay the expense of such counsel pursuant to this Section
10.5(c), and provided further that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give
notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this Agreement, unless such failure causes material harm to
the Indemnifying Party's defense such claim or litigation. No Indemnifying
Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability with respect to such claim or litigation.

             (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10.5 is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified
Party with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to
therein, then the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified
Party hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, liability, claim damage or expense
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the
Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by or on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission.

             (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in any underwriting
agreement entered into by Seller in connection with an underwritten public
offering of the Stock Consideration are in conflict with the foregoing
provisions, the provisions in such underwriting agreement shall control.

         11. NONDISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Each of the Parties
recognizes and acknowledges that it has had access to certain confidential
information of the Partnership, the General Partner and the other Parties and
that after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will be
valuable, special and unique property of Purchaser. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will, and will cause its affiliates and representatives, to keep
confidential and not disclose to any other Person or use for its own benefit or
for the benefit of any other Person, and it will use the efforts it uses with
regard to its own confidential information to prevent disclosure by any other
Person of, any such confidential information to any Person for any purpose or
reason whatsoever, except to authorized representatives of such Party, and
except as required in Purchaser's reasonable judgment to be necessary for
development or commercialization of the Product Business; provided, however,
such limitation shall not apply to any information which (a) is then generally
known to the public; (b) become or becomes generally known to the public through
no fault of such Party, its Affiliates and representatives, and (c) is disclosed
in accordance with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or applicable
law. Seller may have entered into certain confidentiality agreements with third
parties regarding


                                      -24-
<PAGE>


the Product and shall promptly provide ILEX copies of all such confidentiality
agreements. Prior to the Effective Date, Seller will request that all such third
parties return to Seller such confidential information provided to such parties
by or on behalf of Seller or that such information be destroyed. On the
Effective Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assign all
of its rights in and to any such confidentiality agreements to Purchaser. Each
party acknowledges that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by a Party
of any of the provisions contained in this Section 11, the other Parties will
suffer irreparable damage or injury not fully compensable by money damages, or
the exact amount of which may be impossible to ascertain, and therefore, the
other parties will not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each Party
shall be entitled to such injunctive relief or other equitable relief, without
the necessity of posting bond therefor, from any court of competent jurisdiction
as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or curtail any such actual or
threatened breach. The foregoing shall be in addition to and without prejudice
to any other rights that each party may have under this Agreement, at law or in
equity, including, without limitation, the right to sue for and recover money
damages.

         12. INDEMNIFICATION.

             (a) ILEX shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the MLNM Parties
against any losses, expenses, liabilities or other damages, including reasonable
costs of investigation, interest, penalties and attorneys' fees arising out of
claims of third parties (collectively, "Losses") incurred by the MLNM Parties or
any of their affiliates or their officers, directors, agents or employees
(collectively, the "MLNM Group"), to the extent relating to or resulting from
(i) any inaccuracy of a representation or breach of a covenant or warranty made
by the ILEX Parties in this Agreement; (ii) any liabilities, obligations or
commitments of, or claims against any member of the MLNM Group based on the
manufacture, use or sale of any Product by or on behalf of the Partnership, ILEX
or any third party other than a member of the MLNM Group with respect to such
Products sold on or after the Closing Date, except to the extent such Product
was manufactured by or for the Partnership prior to Closing and such claim is
attributable to defective Product resulting from such manufacture; provided,
however, that ILEX shall not have any obligations under this Section for Losses
to the MLNM Group to the extent that such Losses are subject to indemnification
by Seller; and (iii) up to fifty percent (50%) of all Losses incurred by the
Partnership resulting from the manufacture, use or sale of any Product on or
before the Closing Date by the Partnership.

             (b) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the ILEX
Parties against (i) all Losses incurred by the ILEX Parties or any of its
affiliates or their officers, directors, agents or employees (collectively, the
"ILEX Group") to the extent relating to or resulting from any inaccuracy of a
representation or breach of a covenant or warranty made by any of the MLNM
Parties in this Agreement; and (ii) fifty percent (50%) of all Losses incurred
by the Partnership resulting from the manufacture, use or sale of any Product on
or before the Closing Date by the Partnership.

         13. CONTRACT COVENANTS.

             (a) ILEX and Seller agree, and agree to cause the Partnership to
negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to execute prior
to Closing (i) subject to the terms and conditions of the BTG License and the
BTG Sublicense, an amendment (the "BTG


                                      -25-
<PAGE>


Amendment") to the BTG Sublicense to incorporate the terms and conditions of the
Deed of Variation dated May 19, 1998 between BTG and Seller, as successor in
interest to LKS; and (ii) subject to the terms and conditions of the MRC
License, a sublicense of Seller's rights under the MRC License to the
Partnership with respect to the Product (the "MRC Sublicense").

             (b) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts subject to the
terms and conditions of the BTG Agreement, to assign, transfer and convey to
ILEX or its designee, and ILEX or such designee shall assume, Seller's right,
title and interest in and to the BTG Agreements, on the Closing Date. Seller and
ILEX shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third
party consents or authorizations that may be required in connection therewith.
In the event that despite Seller's and ILEX's commercially reasonable efforts
the written approval of or consent to the assignment of the BTG License is not
obtained on or prior to the Closing, Seller agrees to continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from BTG, said assignment and, if such
consent cannot ultimately be obtained, Seller shall, in lieu of such consent,
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from BTG a commitment that in the
event the BTG License is prematurely terminated, BTG will exclusively license to
the Partnership the rights licensed to Seller under the BTG License on the same
terms and subject to the same conditions as set forth in the BTG License. In the
event that despite Seller's and ILEX's commercially reasonable efforts the
written approval of or consent to the assignment of the Wellcome Agreement is
not obtained on or prior to the Closing, Seller agrees, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Wellcome Agreement, to continue to use commercially reasonable
efforts to sublicense its rights under the Wellcome Agreement to ILEX or ILEX's
designee (such sublicense, the "Wellcome Sublicense").

             (c) ILEX and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall cause the Partnership to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Almedica Agreement, to negotiate and execute an
agreement between the Partnership and Almedica Europe Limited and Almedica
Services Corp. (collectively, "Almedica") with respect to the distribution and
packaging of certain clinical trial material with respect to the Product
Business on or before the Closing Date. If such an agreement has not been
executed by the Closing, promptly after the Closing Seller and the Partnership
will send to Almedica a joint instruction letter or packaging summary
instructing Almedica to perform services with respect to the Product under the
Almedica Agreement for the account of the Partnership and to take instruction
with respect to the Product from representatives of the Partnership or the ILEX
parties and not from Seller.

             (d) Seller agrees that subject to the terms and conditions of the
license agreement or agreement to which a Sublicense Agreement relates (each
such license agreement is hereinafter referred to as a "License Agreement"),
Seller shall not terminate such Sublicense Agreement except in the event that
the applicable Sublicensee breaches or fails to perform any of its obligations
under such Sublicense Agreement or in the event that Seller has a right under
such Sublicense Agreement to terminate such Sublicense Agreement as a result of
the actual or potential bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, winding up or other
similar condition or status of the Sublicensee, including but not limited to the
appointment of a receiver or an official with an analogous function with respect
to the Sublicensee, in either of which cases Seller may terminate the Sublicense
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Seller further agrees that any royalties
or other fees in respect of a Sublicense Agreement that are required to be paid
by Seller to third party licensors under a License Agreement may be paid
directly by the Sublicensee to the


                                      -26-
<PAGE>


applicable third party licensor; provided that Sublicensee provides Seller with
a written confirmation of such payment together with a copy of any accompanying
report or statement. Seller further agrees that it will comply with all the
terms and conditions within its control of the License Agreement to which each
Sublicense Agreement relates and will take no action, nor omit to take any
action in each case within its control, that would constitute a breach or cause
a termination of the License Agreements. It is understood and agreed that Seller
will require no additional payments of fees or royalties to Seller in connection
with the execution of the BTG Amendment, the Wellcome Sublicense, or the MRC
Sublicense.

             (e) Within five (5) business days after execution of this
Agreement, Seller shall provide ILEX with copies of the Miscellaneous Contracts.
Prior to the Closing Date Seller may amend Exhibit A-3 to include any additional
contract or agreement directly related to the Product Business discovered by
Seller after the date hereof, and provide ILEX with a copy of same. Within
fifteen (15) business days after receipt of such copies of the Miscellaneous
Contracts, ILEX shall identify those Miscellaneous Contracts (or portions of the
Miscellaneous Contracts) that ILEX would like the Seller to seek to assign, or
grant a sublicense, to the Partnership. Subject to the terms and conditions of
such Miscellaneous Contract, Seller and ILEX shall assign ownership or grant an
exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up sublicense to the Partnership,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents
and authorizations required to effect such assignment or sublicense on or before
the Closing. Any such sublicense shall be on an irrevocable and royalty-free
basis (other than pass through royalties or fees owed by Seller to any third
party licensor and subject to the Partnership's obligation and ability to
perform under such sublicense), with Seller committing to do all acts within
Seller's control to maintain any license under which a sublicense is granted. To
the extent after the Closing Date Seller discovers any additional contract or
agreement of Seller which is in existence as of the Closing Date and is directly
related to the Product Business, Seller shall promptly provide ILEX with a copy
of such contract or agreement and the provisions of this paragraph shall apply
to each such contract or agreement.

             (f) Effective as of the Closing Date, ILEX hereby guarantees in
full the payment and performance of each of (i) Sublicensee's obligations under
the Sublicense Agreements and (ii) the Partnership's obligations under the
Almedica Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will Seller be
required to bear any material out-of-pocket expenses or costs in order to comply
with the provisions of this Article 13. Material out-of-pocket expenses or costs
means more than $25,000 of fees and expenses for professional (i.e., legal and
accounting) services incurred by Seller pursuant to this Article 13.

         14. NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands and other communications

         15.2 Effect of Termination. If the Parties terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Article 15 above, all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other Party
(except for any liability of any Party then in breach of this Agreement) and
except for the provisions of Sections 11 and 16.

         16. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

         16.1 Governing Law; Interpretation; Section Headings. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware without regard to conflict-of-laws rules as applied in
Delaware. The section headings contained herein are for purposes of convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part of this Agreement or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement in any way.

         16.2 Severability. Should any provision of this Agreement be held
unenforceable or invalid under the laws of the United States of America or the
State of Delaware, or under any other applicable laws of any other jurisdiction,
then the parties hereto agree that such provision shall be deemed modified for
purposes of performance of this Agreement in such jurisdiction to the extent
necessary to render it lawful and enforceable, or if such a modification is not
possible without materially altering the intention of the parties hereto, then
such provision shall be severed herefrom for purposes of performance of this
Agreement in such jurisdiction. The validity of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall not be affected by any such modification or severance, except
that if any severance materially alters the intentions of the parties hereto as
expressed herein (a modification being permitted only if there is no material
alteration).

         16.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Letter Agreement between
Seller and ILEX to be delivered at Closing by the parties thereto set forth the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes all prior agreements,
arrangements and understandings related to the subject matter hereof, including
but not limited to the Confidential Disclosure Agreement between Seller and
Purchaser dated August 10, 2001. No representation, promise, inducement or
statement of intention has been made by any party hereto which is not embodied
or referenced in this Agreement or the documents or agreements referenced
herein, and no party hereto shall be bound by or liable for any alleged
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not so set forth.

         16.4 Binding Effect. All the terms, provisions, covenants and
conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

         16.5 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
Parties hereto shall not be assigned or delegated by any party hereto without
the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto except if such assignment
occurs in connection with the sale or transfer (by merger or otherwise) of all
or substantially all of the business and assets of such Party, provided that the
acquirer confirms to the other Parties in writing its agreement to be bound by
all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate, provided that
such Party shall guarantee the performance of such Affiliate, and provided
further that any party may assign its rights (but not its obligations)


                                      -29-
<PAGE>


pursuant to this Agreement in whole or in part to an Affiliate of such Party
that is controlled by such Party.

         16.6 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled, and any of the terms, provisions, representations,
warranties, covenants or conditions hereof may be waived, only by a written
instrument executed by all parties hereto, or, in the case of a waiver, by the
party waiving compliance. The failure of any party at any time or times to
require performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right
to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of any condition contained in this
Agreement, or of the breach of any term, provision, representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be
deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach, or as a waiver of any other condition or of the breach of
any other term, provision, representation, warranty or covenant.

         16.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement
shall be binding when one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken
together, shall bear the signatures of the parties reflected hereon as
signatories.

         16.8 Facsimile Execution and Delivery. A facsimile reproduction of this
Agreement may be executed by one or more parties hereto, and an executed copy of
this Agreement may be delivered by one or more parties hereto by facsimile or
similar instantaneous electronic transmission device pursuant to which the
signature of or on behalf of such party can be seen, and such execution and
delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all purposes. At
the request of any party hereto, all parties hereto agree to execute an original
of this Agreement as well as any facsimile hereof.

         16.9 Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each of the parties will pay all costs and expenses of its
performance of and compliance with this Agreement.

         16.10 Effect of Due Diligence. Each of the MLMN Parties, on the one
hand, and the ILEX Parties, on the other hand, agree that to the extent that any
representation or warranty of either is, to the actual knowledge of the other's
officers, incorrect, then such party shall not have any rights under Article 12
by reason of such inaccuracy.

         16.11 Press Releases and Public Announcements. No Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement prior to the Closing without the prior approval of the other
Parties; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by applicable law (in which case the
disclosing Party will use its reasonable commercially reasonable efforts to
advise the other Parties prior to making the disclosure).

         16.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.


                                      -30-

         16.13 Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or
foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
word "including" shall mean including without limitation. The Parties intend
that each representation, warranty and covenant contained herein shall have
independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation, warranty
or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter
(regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party has not
breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach
of the first representation, warranty or covenant.

         16.14 Incorporation of Exhibits. The Exhibits identified in this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

         16.15 Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that
the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
Parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled, at law or in equity.

         16.16 Remedies Cumulative. All rights, powers and remedies provided
under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in
equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning of
the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or
later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party.
