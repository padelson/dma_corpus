Company or any shares of common stock of Merger Sub:

  

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub

Common Shares issuable upon redemption of each such OP Unit in accordance
with the OP Agreement as if such OP Units were redeemed for an equal number
of Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time.

  

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) **_Exchange Agent_**. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent

payment or exchange in accordance with this Article II of the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration, any Other
Payments, any amounts to be paid in cash pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof and

representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to
deliver, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the

timely pay such amounts and such cash in lieu of fractional shares, in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall make payments of the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Partnership Merger
Consideration, the Other Payments and any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement, the
Maryland Articles of Merger and the Delaware Merger Certificate.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all
interest earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to
Parent.

  

(b) **_Stock Transfer Books_**. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing ownership
of the Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time,
any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Company or
the transfer agent for any reason shall be converted into the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Article II, any Other Payments
deliverable hereunder and any dividends or distributions in respect of Parent
Common Stock.

  

(c) **_Exchange Procedures_**. Promptly after the Effective Time and, in
any event, not later than the second Business Day following the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, any
Other Payments deliverable hereunder and any dividends or distributions in
respect of Parent Common Stock: (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration, the Other Payments, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(j) and any dividends
or distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.2(k) to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required

        
   

  

by the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement, (y) a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.3) equal to the Cash Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement plus any cash such holder is
entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and
any cash dividends or distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock,
payable in respect of the Company Common Shares previously represented by
such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(c), Section 2.2(j)
and Section 2.2(k) and (z) without duplication, any Other Payments, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed and accompanied by appropriate
stock powers or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and accompanied by
all documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent to evidence and
effect such transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or
is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, the Other Payments, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends or distributions in respect of Parent
Common Stock, as contemplated by this Section 2.2. No interest shall be paid
or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time and, in any event, not later than the
second Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of OP Units registered on the transfer
books of the Operating Partnership immediately prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time (A) a letter of transmittal (a " _Unitholder Letter of
Transmittal_ ") which shall certify to Parent and to the Exchange Agent the
number of OP Units held by such holder and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as the Surviving Company may reasonably specify and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the delivery of the Unitholder Letter of
Transmittal in order to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration together

of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(k) and fractional

(ii) Upon delivery of a Unitholder Letter of Transmittal, duly executed, and
any other documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or the
Surviving Company, the holder of the OP Units identified in such Unitholder
Letter of Transmittal shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement, (y) a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.3) equal to the amount of the Cash Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement plus any cash
such holder is entitled to receive in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.2(j) and Section 2.2(k) and (z) without duplication,
any Other Payments.

        
   

  

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of OP Units which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Operating Partnership, the
Partnership Merger Consideration shall be paid to a transferee if (A) such
transferee delivers a Unitholder Letter of Transmittal in accordance with
Section 2.2(d)(i) and (B) such transferee shall pay any transfer or other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person (as defined herein) other
than the registered holder of the OP Unit or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Partnership that such Tax has been paid
or is not applicable.

  

(e) **_No Further Ownership Rights In Company Common Shares; Share
Transfers_**.

  

(i) At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Shares shall cease to
be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company other than the
right to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Other
Payments, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or
distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock provided under this Article
II. The Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Other Payments, cash
in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions in
respect of Parent Common Stock paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates representing Company Common Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Common Shares exchanged
theretofore represented by such Certificates.

  

(ii) At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, holders of OP Units shall
cease to be, and shall have no rights as, holders of units of limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership other than the right to
receive the Partnership Merger Consideration, the Other Payments, cash in
lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions in respect of
Parent Common Stock provided under this Article II. The Partnership
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
or distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock, as paid with respect to
the OP Units in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such OP Units and,
after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Partnership
of the OP Units.

  

(f) **_Termination of Exchange Fund_**. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or the OP
Units which were converted into the right to receive the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration or Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable, the
Other Payments, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any dividends
or distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock for six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and any holders
of Company Common Shares or OP Units who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration or Partnership
Merger Consideration, as applicable (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Law).

  

(g) **_No Liability for Certain Funds_**. None of the Purchaser Parties, the
Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership, the Company, the Operating
Partnership or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director,
trustee, partner, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person
in respect of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration or Partnership
Merger Consideration, as applicable, and the Other Payments from the Exchange

        
   

  

Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(h) **_Investment of Exchange Fund_**. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent; **_provided_**
**,** ** _however_** , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments, shall be placed in the Exchange Fund and be
payable to Parent pursuant to Section 2.2(f) hereof. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Partnership Merger
Consideration, the Other Payments, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any dividends or distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock, as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of
the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments.

  

(i) **_Lost Certificates_**. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent, the Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, the Other Payments, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends or distributions in respect of Parent
Common Stock into which the Company Common Shares theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(j) **_Fractional Shares_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or OP Units, no dividend or distribution with
respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.  In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each
former stockholder of the Company and each former holder of OP Units who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount
in cash (rounded to the nearest cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying (i) the Parent Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share
(after taking into account all Company Common Shares held by such holder at
the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1. " ** _Parent Closing Price_** "
shall mean the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of the
closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Transaction Reporting System during the ten consecutive trading
days ending two days prior to the Effective Time.

  

(k) **_Dividends and Distributions on Parent Common Stock_**. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or OP Unit until the surrender of such

        
   

  

Certificate or OP Unit in accordance with this Article II. Following
surrender of any Certificate or OP Unit there shall be paid to the holder of
such Certificate or OP Unit in addition to the other amounts payable
hereunder (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

(l) **_Uncertificated Shares or Interests_**. Appropriate adjustments shall be
made to the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2 to permit the payment of
the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Partnership
Merger Consideration, the Other Payments and other amounts payable under
this Section 2.2 in the case of any uncertificated Company Common Shares or
OP Units as if such shares or units were represented by certificates.

  

Section 2.3. _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Company, the Surviving
Partnership, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Company Common Share Merger Consideration,
the Partnership Merger Consideration and other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld by the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made. Any withholding Tax deducted
and withheld pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall first reduce the Cash
Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration or
the Partnership Merger Consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company
Common Shares or OP Units, as applicable (or any cash otherwise payable to
any Person, in the case of amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement), and, to the extent the withholding Tax exceeds the aggregate Cash
Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration or
the Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable, otherwise payable to
such holder (or cash otherwise payable to such Person), the excess of the
withholding Tax over the aggregate Cash Consideration payable to such holder
(or cash otherwise payable to such Person) shall be applied to reduce the
Stock Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration or the Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable,
otherwise payable to such holder based on the average, rounded to the nearest
one ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Reporting System during the ten
consecutive trading days ending two days prior to the Effective Time.

  

Section 2.4. _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 2.5. _Company Share Options; Restricted Company Common Shares_.

  

(a) At least 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall permit
the holders of the outstanding options to purchase Company Common
Stock (collectively, the " ** _Company Share Options_** ") granted under the
Companys equity compensation plans (collectively, the " ** _Company Share
Plans_** "), whether or not such options are then vested or exercisable, to
exercise such options to the extent determined by the holders, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Company Share
Option, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be

        
   

  

cancelled and of no further force and effect and converted into the right to
receive promptly following the Effective Time, an amount, payable in the
proportion of Parent Common Stock and cash contemplated by the Company Common
Share Merger Consideration, equal to the product of (i) the number of Company
Common Shares purchasable under such Company Share Option had such Company
Share Option been fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and
such holder exercised such Company Share Option in full immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Share
Option, less any applicable withholding Tax (the " ** _Option
Consideration_** ").

  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted
Company Common Share (" ** _Restricted Share_** ") shall vest, the
restrictions thereon shall lapse, and each Restricted Share shall
be converted into the right to receive the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(c). All payments under this
Section 2.5(b) shall be subject to any applicable withholding Tax.

  

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding and unsettled
unit representing a right to receive a Company Common Share or
restricted Company Common Share granted under the Company Share Plans (the "
** _Units_** ") shall vest (in the case of any such Units subject to
performance goals, such Units shall vest at the level specified in the
Company Share Plans and the applicable award agreements for a Change of
Control (as defined therein)), the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and,
each Unit shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to a Company
Common Share, shall be cancelled and of no further force and effect and shall
be converted into the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration per Unit as provided in Section 2.1(a). ** **All payments
under this Section 2.5(c) shall be subject to any applicable withholding Tax.

  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall
take all actions necessary to facilitate the implementation of the provisions
contained in this Section 2.5. The Company covenants and agrees that it shall
cause the Company Share Plans to terminate as of the Effective Time
and (subject to compliance with Section 2.5) all awards issued under
such Company Share Plans to be terminated and the provisions of any other
plan, program, arrangement or agreement providing for the issuance or grant
of any other interest in respect of equity interests of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to be of no further force and effect and to be deemed to
be terminated as of the Effective Time and so that (subject to compliance
with Section 2.5) no holder of Company Share Options, Restricted Shares or
any participation in any Company Share Plan shall have any right thereunder
to (i) acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving Company or
any Subsidiary thereof or (ii) receive any payment or benefit with respect
to any award previously granted under the Company Share Plans except as
provided in this Section 2.5.

  

(e) On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Company or,
if directed by the Company, the Exchange Agent an amount in cash and other
securities sufficient to satisfy the obligations described in this Section
2.5.

  

Section 2.6. _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur (other than as a result of
a transaction permitted by Article V hereof) as a result of any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution, merger or other
similar transaction, the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the
Partnership Merger

        
   

  

Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_
 that nothing in this Section 2.6 shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number
or kind of shares or securities or other consideration as a result of a
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution, merger or other
similar transaction, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the Stock Consideration component of the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration; _provided_
that nothing in this Section 2.6 shall be construed to permit Parent to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement. In the event that either the Company or Parent
shall declare or pay any dividend or distribution (other than the regular
quarterly cash dividends otherwise permitted hereunder and other than Other
Payments) including for the purpose of maintaining its status as a REIT or of
eliminating any U.S. federal income or excise Taxes otherwise payable, the
Cash Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration
and the Partnership Merger Consideration shall be adjusted as described
below. In the event of such a dividend or distribution by the Company, the
Cash Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration
per share and the Partnership Merger Consideration per OP Unit shall be
reduced by the per share amount of such dividend or distribution. In
the event of such a dividend or distribution by Parent, the Cash
Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration per
share and the Partnership Merger Consideration per OP Unit shall be increased
by the product of the Exchange Ratio and the amount of such dividend or
distribution. For purposes of clarification, this adjustment shall apply to
the special dividend referred to on Section 5.2 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule.

  

Section 2.7. _Tax Characterization_. The parties intend that, for U.S.
federal and state income Tax purposes, the Merger shall be treated as a
taxable purchase of the Company Common Shares by Parent OP, and the
Partnership Merger shall be treated as a taxable purchase of interests in the
Operating Partnership to the extent such interests are exchanged for
the Partnership Merger Consideration, and as a recapitalization of any
remaining interests in the Operating Partnership.

  

Section 2.8. _Direct Purchase of Assets_.  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent may elect to purchase one or more of the
Company Properties (the " _Designated_ _Properties_ "), immediately prior to,
and conditioned upon, the Effective Time at a purchase price to be determined
by Parent either (A) for Parent Common Stock (a " _Stock Acquisition_ ") or
(B) for cash pursuant to one or more separate agreements of sale of such
Designated Properties that provide that Parent has the right to execute and
assign to an exchange facilitator, qualified intermediary, exchange
accommodation titleholder or similar entity its interest therein to
facilitate a like-kind exchange of the Designated Properties in a transaction
or transactions which are intended to qualify for treatment by Parent as a
tax-deferred like-kind exchange pursuant to the provisions of Section 1031 of
the Code (a " _1031 Exchange_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
aggregate of the cash purchase price for the Designated Properties pursuant
to this Section 2.8 and the cash proceeds from the sale of the Deeded
Properties (defined below) pursuant to Section 2.9 shall not exceed the
aggregate Cash Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration, and (ii) the
aggregate of the purchase price for the Designated Properties paid in Parent
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall not exceed the aggregate
Stock Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration. If Parent elects to
acquire one or more Designated Properties prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and the applicable Company Subsidiary shall reasonably cooperate in
effectuating the Stock Acquisition or 1031 Exchange of the Designated
Properties and in implementing any such assignment and/or execution of any
documentation, and the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary shall
sell the Designated

        
   

  

Properties directly to Parent (or its assignees) immediately prior to, and
conditioned upon, the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Companys and the applicable Company Subsidiarys obligation to take any
actions required by this Section 2.8 shall be subject to the condition that
all conditions to the Closing have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions which may only be satisfied or waived at the Effective Time, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) and Parent
irrevocably commits in writing to consummate the Closing on the date such
actions are required; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no event shall the
Company or any Company Subsidiary be obligated to take any action pursuant to
this Section 2.8 in violation of Law, that would be reasonably expected to
result in any entity failing to be Solvent or that would cause a breach of
any indenture, organizational document or other contract or agreement, or
that could reasonably be expected to cause the Company to fail to qualify as
a REIT; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may not take or direct the
Company to take any such action if such purchase of any Company Property
would reasonably be expected to result in adverse tax consequences to the
holders of Company Common Shares or OP Units. Parent shall notify the Company
of any such transfer and identify the related Designated Properties and
transferee no later than five Business Days prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to the foregoing requirements, any cash or Parent Common Stock
received in connection with the sale of the Designated Properties shall be
distributed by the Operating Partnership to its partners and the Company to
its stockholders immediately prior to, and conditioned upon, the Effective
Time. If any Designated Properties are acquired by Parent (or its assignees)
for cash, on the one hand, or for Parent Common Stock, on the other hand,
then the Cash Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration or the Stock
Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and
the Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable, will be reduced ratably
by the aggregate amount distributed by the Operating Partnership to its
partners and by the Company to its stockholders in respect of such Designated
Properties. Parent will prepare at its expense all documents and other
instruments referred to in this Section 2.8, and Parent will pay all transfer
Taxes, recording fees and other costs in connection with any transfer of
Designated Properties. Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, partners, members, employees, agents and representatives
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments, penalties and Taxes arising or
resulting from, or suffered or incurred by any of them, in connection with
any actions taken in connection with this Section 2.8 (which indemnification
shall survive the Closing). The Company shall be entitled to enforce the
provisions of the foregoing sentence on behalf of each Person referred to
therein that is not a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, there shall be no reduction in the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration, or in the amounts
to be paid to holders of any Company Share Option, Restricted Share or Unit
by virtue of this Section 2.8, except to the extent such holder actually
receives a distribution pursuant to this Section 2.8.  The right of Parent
to utilize shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall
be subject to the ability of Parent to register such shares on the Form S-4.

  

Section 2.9. _Transfer of Company Properties_.  Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall, or shall cause the
applicable Company Subsidiary to, transfer (each a " _Transfer_
"), immediately prior to, and conditioned upon, the Effective Time, by deed
or by transfer of ownership interests in an entity that directly or
indirectly owns one or more of the Company Properties (the " _Deeded
Properties_ "), one or more of the Company Properties, as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Companys and the applicable Company
Subsidiarys obligation to take any actions required by this Section 2.9
shall be subject to the condition that all conditions to the Closing have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which may only be
satisfied or waived at the Effective Time, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions) and Parent irrevocably commits in writing to
consummate the Closing on the date such actions are required; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary be
obligated to take any action pursuant to this Section 2.9 in violation of
Law, that would be reasonably expected to result in any entity failing to

        
   

  

be Solvent, that would cause a breach of any indenture, other organizational
document or other contract or agreement, or that could reasonably be expected
to cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Parent may not take or direct the Company to take any such action if
such Transfer of any Deeded Property would reasonably be expected to result
in adverse tax consequences to the holders of Company Common Shares or
OP Units. Parent shall notify the Company of any such transfer and identify
the related Deeded Property and transferee no later than five Business Days
prior to the Effective Time. Parent may direct the transferee of such Deeded
Property to deliver a portion of the Cash Consideration; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent shall be liable for any failure of the transferee to
deliver such Cash Consideration.  Subject to the foregoing, requirements, any
cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of the Deeded Properties
shall be distributed by the Operating Partnership to its partners and the
Company to its stockholders immediately prior to, and conditioned upon, the
Effective Time. If any Deeded Properties are purchased for cash, the
aggregate of the cash proceeds from the sale of the Deeded
Properties pursuant to this Section 2.9 and the cash purchase price for
the Designated Properties pursuant to Section 2.8 shall not exceed
the aggregate Cash Consideration component of the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration, and ****
the Cash Consideration component of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration will be reduced
ratably by the aggregate amount distributed by the Operating Partnership to
its partners and by the Company to its stockholders in respect of such
Designated Properties. Any transfer Taxes, recording fees and other costs
incurred by the Company or the relevant Company Subsidiary in connection with
such transfer of a Deeded Property shall be the responsibility of Parent.
Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, partners, members,
employees, agents and representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties and Taxes arising or resulting from, or suffered or
incurred by any of them, in connection with any actions taken in connection
with this Section 2.9 (which indemnification shall survive the Closing). The
Company shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of the foregoing sentence
on behalf of each Person referred to therein that is not a party to this
Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, there shall be
no reduction in the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the
Partnership Merger Consideration, or in the amounts to be paid to holders of
any Company Share Option, Restricted Share or Unit by virtue of this Section
2.9, except to the extent such holder actually receives a distribution
pursuant to this Section 2.9.

statute, ordinance, requirement, rule or regulation applicable to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or any of its respective properties or assets
(collectively, " _Laws_ "), excluding from the foregoing clauses (i) (other
than in the case of the Company), (ii), (iii) and (iv) any of the foregoing
which, would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect and any of the foregoing arising in
connection with the Financing or arising as a result of any circumstances or
requirements applicable to Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  

Section 3.7. _SEC Reports_.

  

(a) The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents required to be filed with the SEC since January 1, 2004
(collectively, the " ** _Company SEC Reports_** "), all of which, at the time
of filing thereof (except as and to the extent such Company SEC Report has
been modified or superseded in any subsequent Company SEC Report filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement) complied in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" ** _SOX_** ") and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " ** _Securities Laws_** ")
applicable to such Company SEC Reports. As of their respective dates (except
as and to the extent modified or superseded in any subsequent Company SEC
Report filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, in
the case of Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, or prior to
the Effective Time, in the case of subsequently-filed Company SEC Reports),
none of the Company SEC Reports at the time of filing contained, nor will any
report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed by the Company
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time contain, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Reports complied, or
will comply if filed after the date hereof, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been, or will be if filed after the date
hereof, prepared in

        
   

  

accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and subject to
normal year end audit adjustments which would not be material in amount or
effect) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented, or will fairly
present if filed after the date hereof, in accordance with the applicable
requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the
assets, liabilities and the consolidated financial position of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the dates thereof and
the consolidated results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows
for the periods then ended (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, which are subject to normal,
recurring adjustments, none of which are material). As of the date hereof, no
Company Subsidiary (including the Operating Partnership) is subject to the
periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

  

(b) There are no liabilities of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and
whether or not contingent or absolute or determined other than (i)
liabilities disclosed in or reserved against or provided for on the face of
the audited balance sheet (or disclosed in the notes thereto) in the most
recent consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (the " ** _Balance
Sheet_** "), (ii) liabilities incurred on behalf of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since the date of the Balance Sheet
and as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) The management of the Company has (i) implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including the consolidated Company Subsidiaries, is made known to the
management of the Company, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and (B) any fraud or allegation of fraud whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys or any of the Companys Subsidiaries internal controls
over financial reporting.

  

(d) The Company has not identified any material weaknesses in the design or
operation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. To the
knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX when next due.

  

Section 3.8. _Litigation and Regulatory Matters; Compliance with Laws_.

  

(a) There is no litigation, suit, arbitration, claim, investigation, action
or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective property or
assets that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect,
nor is there any such litigation, suit, arbitration, claim, investigation,
action or proceeding pending against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any of their respective properties or assets which in any manner challenges
or seeks to prevent or enjoin, alter or materially delay the

        
   

  

Mergers that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not subject to any judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority that
prohibits or would reasonably be expected to prohibit the consummation of the
Mergers.

  

(c) Since January 1, 2004, each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
has been operated at all times in compliance with all Laws applicable to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or by which any property, business
or asset of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is bound or
affected, except for such failures as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written
notification of violation of, and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has knowledge of any claim alleging the violation of, any
applicable Law of any Governmental Entity, except for violations and notices
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.9. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the date of the Balance
Sheet, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, except as permitted under Section 5.1, and during such period there
has not been:

  

(a) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to
equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (other than the
declaration and payment of regular quarterly dividends on the Company Common
Shares and corresponding distributions to the limited partners of the
Operating Partnership);

  

(b) any amendment of any term of any outstanding equity security of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any amendment of any

other than changes after the date of this Agreement expressly permitted by
Section 5.1;

  

(e) any split, combination or reclassification of any of the Companys shares
of beneficial interest or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance
of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for, or
giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise, shares of its beneficial
interests or any issuance of an ownership interest in, any
Company Subsidiary;

  

(f) any incurrence, assumption or guarantee by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary of any Indebtedness other than incurrences, assumptions
or guarantees that would be permitted if incurred subsequent to the date of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.1(e);

         
 

  



  

(g) any authorization of, or commitment or agreement to take any of, the
foregoing actions.

  

Since the date of the Balance Sheet, there has not been any event
or occurrence of any condition that has had or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.10. _Taxes_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect:

  

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed (or
had filed on their behalf) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of
them (after giving effect to extensions) and all such Tax Returns were, at
the time filed, true, correct and complete and (ii) has paid (or had paid on
their behalf) all Taxes that are required to be paid by it (whether or not
shown on a Tax Return) or that it is required to withhold from amounts owing
to any employee, creditor or third party, in each case, other than with
respect to matters contested in good faith or adequately reserved against or
provided for (in accordance with GAAP) in the Companys financial statements.

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has executed or
filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority any agreement, waiver
or other document or arrangement extending the period for assessment or
collection of Taxes that remains in effect.

  

(c) The Company, (i) for all taxable years commencing with the Companys
taxable year ending December 31, 2002 through December 31, 2006 has been

within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated since
January 1, 2007 to the date hereof in a manner consistent with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT, and (iii) intends to
continue to operate in such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify
as a REIT for the taxable year of the Company that includes the Merger (and
if the Merger is not consummated prior to January 1, 2008, for the taxable
year that will end on December 31, 2007). No claim has been asserted by
a Tax authority that the Company is not, or has not been, taxable as a

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has engaged at any time in
any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the

to those set forth in Section 1374 of the Code.  The Company has incurred no
liability for any Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code,

(f) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has since the date it became a Subsidiary been treated for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as
the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a
corporation. Each Company Subsidiary that is a corporation qualifies as a
"qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the
Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of Section 856(l)
of the Code.

  



        
   

  



  

(g) As of the date hereof, there are no audits, examination or
other proceedings relating to any Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing and all deficiencies asserted or assessments made with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of any examination by the IRS
or any taxing authority have been paid in full.

  

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has received a written claim by any taxing authority in
a jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file
income Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to income taxation by that
jurisdiction.

(k) There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable)
upon any of the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

(l) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in a

"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying
for the Tax treatment set forth in Section 355 of the Code in the two years
prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

For purposes of this Section 3.10, " _Tax Protection Agreement_ " shall mean
any agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party and
pursuant to which: (a) any liability to holders of OP Units may arise
relating to Taxes, whether or not as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) in connection with the
deferral of income Taxes of a holder of OP Units, the Company or any of the

and collectively the " ** _Company Properties_** "), which are all of the
real estate properties owned by them or in which any of them own a direct or
indirect equity interest.

  

(b) Section 3.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of all real property leased (including ground leased) or
subleased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as tenant (collectively,
the " ** _Leased Properties_** "), and the address of the premises leased
thereunder.  Complete and correct copies of all leases and other agreements
pursuant to which each Leased Property is demised to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary,

  



        
   

  



  

including all amendments or modifications thereof and all side letters or
other instruments materially affecting the obligations of any party
thereunder (collectively the " ** _Leases_** "), have been made available to
the Purchaser Parties to the extent that such leases and other agreements are
in the Companys possession or control, except for omissions that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the phrase "made
available to the Purchaser Parties" with respect to documents relating to the
Company means documents that are either (i) posted on the Companys due
diligence data site for this transaction as of the date prior to the date
hereof, or (ii) made available for review at the Companys offices as of the
date prior to the date hereof. Each Lease is in full force and effect and
is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms against the
lessee thereunder, and, to the Companys knowledge, against the lessor and/or
the other parties thereto, except as would not constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor to the Companys knowledge, any lessor,
is in monetary default or other material default under any Lease (beyond any
applicable notice and cure period), except for such defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) The Company has made available to the Purchaser Parties (i) all policies
of title insurance obtained by the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary insuring title to any of the Company Properties, to the extent
that such title insurance policies are in the possession or control of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary, and (ii) all existing surveys of the Company
Properties in the Companys or the applicable Company Subsidiaries
possession or control.  Except as listed in Schedule 3.11(c) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule, such title policies for the Company Properties do not
contain exceptions or encumbrances and such surveys do not reveal
encroachments or other defects other than (A) Permitted Liens, and (B) such
other exceptions, encumbrances, title defects and other title matters which
would, individually or in the aggregate, not be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no
material claim has been made against any of such title policies and each such
title policy is in full force and effect as of the date hereof and will be in
effect as of the Closing Date.  As used herein, the term " ** _Permitted
Liens_** " means (i) Liens for Taxes not yet due or delinquent, (ii)
inchoate mechanics and materialmens Liens for construction in progress,
(iii) mechanics, materialmens, workmens, repairmens, warehousemens and
carriers Liens arising in the ordinary course of business of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, (iv) zoning restrictions, survey exceptions,
utility easements, rights of way and similar Liens that are imposed by any

disclosed in any title insurance policy or legible survey for the Company
Properties made available to the Purchaser Parties, (vi) Liens and
obligations arising under or in connection with the Material Contracts, (vii)
any Lien securing mortgage debt disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
(viii) rights of tenants in possession, or under any Company Leases, (ix)
Liens being contested in good faith in the ordinary course of business, and
(x) any other Lien that does not materially interfere with the current use of
the applicable property or materially adversely affect the value of such
property.

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice from any Governmental Entity that any of the Company Properties are in
violation of any existing Laws, rules, regulations, ordinances or orders of
applicable federal, state, city or other governmental authorities in
effect as of the date hereof, which would, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written
notice to the effect that any condemnation or rezoning proceedings
are pending or threatened in writing with respect to any of the Company
Properties which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(f) To the Companys knowledge, with respect to those Company Properties or
Leased Properties used and occupied by tenants for the purpose of conducting
retail banking operations, (i) such tenants are conducting normal retail
banking operations at such Company Properties, and (ii) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notice that any such tenant
has notified any applicable Governmental Entity of such tenants intention to
cease retail banking operations at any Company Property or Leased Property
occupied by such tenant, except (in the case of each of the preceding clauses
(i) and (ii)) as would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(g) Section 3.11(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists as of the date
hereof each "ground lease" under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is party, as lessor. Each such ground lease is in full force and effect and
is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms against the
lessor or lessee thereunder, as applicable, and, to the Companys knowledge,
against the other parties thereto, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, nor, to the Companys knowledge, any
other party, on the other hand, is in monetary default or material non-
monetary default under any such ground lease or in default which is
reasonably likely to result in a termination of such ground lease (beyond any
applicable notice and cure period).  No purchase option has been exercised
under any of such ground leases, except purchase options whose exercise has
been evidenced by a written document as described in Section 3.11(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has made available to the Purchaser
Parties a true, correct and complete copy of each such ground lease and all
amendments thereto.

  

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to
any agreement relating to the management of any of the Company Properties by
a party other than the Company or any wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries,
except as disclosed in Section 3.11(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
copies of which have been made available to the Purchaser Parties.

at any location that is listed or proposed for listing on the

CERCLIS, or any equivalent list of sites for cleanup under any analogous
state program;

  

(c) No Environmental Claims are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have not, and to the knowledge of the Company no
other person has, caused any Release, threatened Release, or disposal of any
Hazardous Material at a Company Property, including Releases resulting in
exposure of any person to any Hazardous Material, that could reasonably be
expected to result in any Environmental Claim against the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, and no Company Property is listed or proposed for listing
on the NPL, CERCLIS, or any equivalent list of sites for cleanup under any
analogous state program; to the knowledge of the Company, the Company Real
Property is not adversely affected by any Release, threatened Release, or
disposal of a Hazardous Substance originating or emanating from any other
property.

  

(d) True and correct copies of all Phase 1 and Phase 2 environmental
assessment reports performed in the past 5 years, in the possession or
control of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, relating to environmental

have any obligation to contribute, none of the Company, any Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate would incur a withdrawal liability that would reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.  There is no unfair
labor practice

  



        
   

  



  

or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries relating to
their business that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. To the Companys knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a
collective bargaining unit presently being made or threatened involving
employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

  

Section 3.15. _No Brokers_. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding with
any Person or firm which may result in the obligation of such entity or the
Purchaser Parties to pay any finders fees, brokerage or agents commissions
or other like payments in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that the Company has retained Greenhill and Co., LLC and
Bank of America Securities LLC (the " _Company Financial Advisors_ ") as its
financial advisors in connection with the Mergers. Prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Company has delivered to the Purchaser Parties a true, correct
and complete copy of all agreements between the Company and the Company
Financial Advisors under which the Company Financial Advisors could be
entitled to any payment relating to the Mergers or such other transactions.

  

Section 3.16. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company Board has received
an opinion of Greenhill and Co., LLC to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of the
Company Common Shares is fair to such holders from a financial point of view.

  

Section 3.17. _Required Approvals_.

  

(a) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Company Common
Shares entitled to be cast on the matter (the " ** _Company Shareholder
Approval_** ") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of
beneficial interest of the Company necessary or required to approve the
Merger.

  

(b) The Required Limited Partners Approval is the only vote or consent
required of the holders of any class or series of the OP Units or other
securities of or equity interests in the Operating Partnership required to

Section 3.18. _Material Contracts_.

  

(a) Except for agreements set forth in the exhibit index in a Covered Company
SEC Disclosure, Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a list of all Material Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement.
The Company has made available to the Purchaser Parties true and complete
copies of all Material Contracts. The Material Contracts are legal, valid,
binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and in full
force and effect with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, with
respect to each other party to any of such Material Contracts, except, in
each case, where such failure to be so legal, valid, binding and enforceable
and in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and except to
the extent that enforcement of rights and remedies created by any Material
Contracts are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general application related to
or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles. Except as
set forth in Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under
(nor does there exist any condition which upon

  



        
   

  



  

the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default under) any Material Contract to which it is a party
or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound and, (ii) to the
knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, there are no such violations
or defaults (nor does there exist any condition which upon the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a violation or default)
with respect to any third party to any Material Contract, except in either
the case of clause (i) or (ii) for those violations or defaults that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Section 3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
respective principal amounts outstanding under each item listed in clause
(iii) of the definition of Material Contracts as of September 30, 2007.

notice of termination of a Material Contract or any part thereof.

  

Section 3.19. _Insurance_. The Company or the Operating Partnership maintains
insurance coverage with reputable insurers, or maintains self-insurance

judgment are reasonable for the business of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (taking into account the cost and availability of such
insurance). There is no claim by the Company or any Company Subsidiary

insurer and (b) would constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 3.20. _Definition of the Company s Knowledge_. As used in this

therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading at the time and in light of the circumstances under which such
statement is made, except that no representation is made (or omitted to be

of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

  

Section 3.22. _Intellectual Property_.

does not have knowledge of any valid grounds for any bona fide claims: (i) to
the effect that the manufacture, sale, licensing

any copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, trade

validity or effectiveness of any of the Company Intellectual Property Rights
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; or (iv) challenging the license
or legally enforceable right to use of the Third-Party Intellectual Property
Rights by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be likely to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each Company Subsidiary
owns, or is licensed to use (in each case free and clear of any
encumbrances), all Intellectual Property currently used in its business as
currently conducted.

  

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " ** _Intellectual Property_** "

any applications therefor, technology, know-how, computer software programs
or applications, and other proprietary information or materials, trademarks,

Intellectual Property Rights_** " means any rights to Company Intellectual
Property owned by any third party, and (iii) " ** _Company Intellectual

 **ARTICLE IV** 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER PARTIES

  

Except (i) as set forth in Parents Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006 (except for the forward looking statements contained in the

contained in the forward-looking statement disclaimer and the risk factors
thereof), (ii) as expressly and specifically disclosed in any Parent SEC
Reports filed or furnished since the date of filing of such Form 10-K and
prior to the date hereof (except, in each case, for the forward-looking
statements therein contained in the forward-looking statement disclaimer and
the risk factors thereof, as applicable) (items (i) and (ii) collectively
being referred to herein as the " _Covered Parent SEC Disclosure_ ") or (iii)
in the disclosure schedules delivered at or prior to the execution hereof to
the Company (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), which schedule
shall identify any exceptions to the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement (with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection to which such information relates; provided
that an item disclosed in any Section or subsection shall be deemed to have
been disclosed for each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the
extent the relevance is readily apparent on the face of such disclosure),
each of the Purchaser Parties, jointly and severally, hereby represents and
warrants to the Company and the Operating Partnership as follows:

  

Section 4.1. _Existence; Good Standing_. Each of the Purchaser Parties is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of their respective jurisdictions of

  



        
   

  



  

organization. Except as set forth in Section 4.1 of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Purchaser Parties is duly qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign entity and is in good standing under the laws of any
other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Purchaser
Parties has all requisite power and authority to own, operate, lease and
encumber its properties and carry on its business in all material respects as
now conducted. True, complete and correct copies of the Articles of
Incorporation of Parent (the " _Parent Articles_ "), the bylaws of Parent
(the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), and the organizational documents of the other
Purchaser Parties, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available to the Company.

  

Section 4.2. _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_.  Each of
the Purchaser Parties has all requisite organizational power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and perform its obligations hereunder,
including the consummation of the Financing by Parent.  The Parent Board at
a duly held meeting has, by unanimous vote, resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of Parent vote in favor of issuance of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Mergers and to include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Purchaser
Parties of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing, have been duly authorized by
all necessary organizational action on behalf of each of the Purchaser
Parties, subject only to approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock by
the holders of a majority of votes entitled to be cast at a meeting of
Parents stockholders duly called and held for such purpose (the " _Parent
Shareholder Approval_ "). This Agreement, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery hereof by the Company and the Operating Partnership,
constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Purchaser
Parties, enforceable against each of the Purchaser Parties in accordance with
its terms.

  

Section 4.3. _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of
Parent consists of an aggregate of 100,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock,

Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the " _Parent Series A
Preferred_ "), and 75,000,000 shares of Excess Stock, $0.001 par value per
share. As of September 30, 2007, 30,902,304 shares of Parent Common Stock are
issued and outstanding and 4,600,000 shares of Parent Series A Preferred are
issued and outstanding and since that date and prior to the date hereof no

Parent Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance, except for shares of
Parent Common Stock reserved for issuance (i) upon exercise of options issued
pursuant to employee and director stock plans of Parent in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (the " _Parent Stock Plans_ ") or (ii) upon the
exchange of units of limited partnership in the Parent OP (" _Parent OP
Units_ "), including Parent OP Units issuable upon exchange of LTIP Units (as
defined in the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of
the Parent OP (the " _Parent OP Partnership Agreement_ ")). All of the
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been, and
all shares of Parent Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Parent
Stock Plans or the Parent OP Partnership Agreement will be, when issued in
accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.  Except as set
forth in Section 4.3 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations or securities the
holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of Parent on any matter (whether together with such stockholders
or as a separate class).  Except with respect to the Parent Stock Plans and
as set forth in Section 4.3 of the Parent Disclosure

  



        
   

  



  

Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no existing options, warrants,
calls, subscription rights, preemptive rights, convertible securities or
other rights, agreements or commitments (contingent or otherwise)
which obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell
any shares of common stock (or similar ownership interest) of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or any investment which is convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for any such shares or similar ownership interest. The shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Mergers have been duly
authorized and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of

free of preemptive rights, purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, subscription or any other similar right.

Parents voting rights, charges or other encumbrances, other than
restrictions and encumbrances imposed under the Securities Act or other
applicable law and except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, or

prevent or materially delay consummation of the Mergers, (B) otherwise
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay performance by the
Purchaser Parties of any of its material obligations under this Agreement or
(C) reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 4.6. _SEC Reports_.

  

(a) Parent has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents required to be filed with the SEC since January 1, 2004
(collectively, the " ** _Parent SEC Reports_** "), all of which, at the time
of filing thereof (except as and to the extent such Parent SEC Report has
been modified or superseded in any subsequent Parent SEC Report filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement) complied in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities
Laws applicable to such Parent SEC Reports.  As of their respective dates
(except as and to the extent modified or superseded in any subsequent Parent
SEC Report filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement,
in the case of Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, or prior to
the Effective Time, in the case of subsequently-filed Parent SEC Reports),
none of Parent SEC Reports at the time of filing contained, nor will any
report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed by Parent after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each
of the consolidated financial statements of Parent included or incorporated
by reference in Parent SEC Reports complied, or will comply if filed after
the date hereof, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been, or will be if filed after the date hereof, prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and subject to
normal year end audit adjustments which would not be material in amount or
effect) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented, or will fairly
present if filed after the date hereof, in accordance with the applicable
requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the
assets, liabilities and the consolidated financial position of Parent and the
Subsidiaries of Parent taken as a whole, as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for
the periods then ended (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, which are subject to normal,
recurring adjustments, none of which are material).

  

(b) There are no liabilities of Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent of any
kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent
or absolute or determined, other than (i) liabilities disclosed or
reserved against or provided for on the face of the audited balance sheet (or
as disclosed in the notes thereto) in the most recent consolidated
financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof (the " ** _Parent Balance Sheet_** "), (ii)
liabilities incurred on behalf of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet and as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) The management of Parent has (i) implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to Parent, including the
consolidated Subsidiaries of Parent, is made known to the management
of Parent, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation,
to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
data and (B) any fraud or allegation of fraud whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who

  



        
   

  



  

have a significant role in Parents or any Subsidiary of Parents internal
controls over financial reporting.

  

(d) Parent has not identified any material weaknesses in the design
or operation of Parents internal control over financial reporting. To the
knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and its
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX when next due.

  

Section 4.7. _Litigation and Regulatory Matters; Compliance with Laws_.

  

(a) There is no litigation, suit, arbitration, claim, investigation, action
or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent or any of their respective
property or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
nor is there any such litigation, suit, arbitration, claim, investigation,
action or proceeding pending against Parent or the Subsidiaries of Parent or
any of their respective properties or assets which in any manner challenges
or seeks to prevent or enjoin, alter or materially delay the Mergers that,
individually or in the aggregate, constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b) Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent is subject to any order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award that
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent is not subject to any judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority that
prohibits or would reasonably be expected to prohibit the consummation of the
Mergers.

  

(c) Since January 1, 2004, each of Parent and the Subsidiaries of Parent has
been operated at all times in compliance with all Laws applicable to Parent
or any of the Subsidiaries of Parent or by which any property, business or
asset of Parent or any of the Subsidiaries of Parent is bound or
affected, except for such failures as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has received written notification
of violation of, and neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has
knowledge of any claim alleging the violation of, any applicable Law of any
Governmental Entity, except for violations and notices that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.  Parent and the Subsidiaries of Parent have obtained
all certificates, permits, licenses, variances (including building permits
and certificates of occupancy), exemptions, orders, franchises and other
authorizations necessary to conduct their respective businesses as they are
now being conducted, except where the failure to obtain any such
certificates, permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises or
authorizations, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

Section 4.8. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the date of the Parent
Balance Sheet, Parent and the Subsidiaries of Parent have conducted their
businesses only in the ordinary course of business, and during such period
there has not been:

consistent with past practice, or (ii) in connection with the use of Parent
Common Stock to pay the exercise price or Tax withholding obligation upon the
exercise of an option issued by Parent);

  

(d) any material change in Parents accounting practices or methods, other
than any change mandated by changes in GAAP or any change after the date of
this Agreement permitted by Section 5.2;

  

(e) any split, combination or reclassification of any of Parents shares of
beneficial interest or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of
any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for, or
giving the right to acquire by exchange or exercise, shares of its beneficial
interests or any issuance of an ownership interest in, any Parent Subsidiary;
or

  

(f) any authorization of, or commitment or agreement to take any of, the
foregoing actions.

Purchaser Parties is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with
the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.  For the

Section 4.13. _Transactions with Affiliates_. Except as set forth in
Parents last annual meeting proxy statement filed with the SEC, no event has
occurred that would be required to be reported by Parent pursuant to Item 404
and 407 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

  

Section 4.14. _Available Funds_. Parent has provided to the Company a true,
complete and correct copy of each fully executed commitment letter, dated as

_Lenders_ ") have committed, subject to the terms thereof, to provide the
Financing. Parent has available to it all financing necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letters
are in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters other than as set
forth therein. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Purchaser Parties
under the Debt Commitment Letters, and none of the Purchaser Parties have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that the Financing will
not be made available to the Purchaser Parties at the Closing.

correct in all material respects without giving effect to any knowledge,
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception)
and (c) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided by the Company to Parent have been prepared in good
faith based upon reasonable assumptions, immediately after giving effect to
all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the
aggregate all amounts required to be paid in connection with the Mergers,
including in respect of Company Common Shares and the OP Units and
the consideration in respect of the Company Share Options and other equity-
based awards hereunder and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that
may be contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters or otherwise required in
connection with the

  



        
   

  



  

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and payment
of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.
For purposes of this Section 4.14, the term " _Solvent_ " with respect to a
Person means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
fair saleable value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (i) the value of all
liabilities of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including
contingent and other liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with the applicable federal Laws governing
determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as
such debts become absolute and matured; (b) such Person will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
business in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent following
such date; and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

  

Section 4.16. _Definition of Parent s Knowledge_. As used in this
Agreement, the phrase "to the knowledge of Parent" or any similar
phrase means the actual knowledge of those individuals identified in Section
4.16 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule after due inquiry.

Meeting, except to the extent necessary to ensure that any amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement required by applicable Law is provided to

Shareholders Meeting. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take all
such other actions necessary or desirable to obtain the Parent Shareholder
Approval, including, without limitation, soliciting proxies in favor of the
Mergers.

  

(e) If, on the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Common Shares to
approve the Merger, the Company shall adjourn the Company Shareholders
Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and
Parent, which date shall not be less than 5 days nor more than

  



        
   

  



  

10 days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use its reasonable best
efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of
proxies from stockholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval. In
addition, in such event, the Company shall be entitled to adjourn or postpone
the Company Shareholder Meeting to the extent required by Law and in any
event up to 10 days from the date it would otherwise be convened.

  

(f) If, on the date of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, Parent has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares to
approve the Merger, Parent shall adjourn the Parent Shareholders
Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and
Parent, which date shall not be less than 5 days nor more than 10 days after

Agreement Parent shall continue to use its reasonable best efforts, together
with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from
stockholders relating to the Parent Shareholder Approval.  In addition, in
such event, the Parent shall be entitled to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Shareholders Meeting to the extent required by Law and in any event up to 10
days from the date it would otherwise be convened.

  

(g) Approval of this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are the only matters that the Company will propose to be
acted on by the holders of Company Common Shares at the Company Shareholders
Meeting.

  

(h) Approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Mergers is the
only matter that Parent will propose to be acted on by its stockholders at
the Parent Shareholders Meeting.

  

Section 6.2. _Other Filings_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement shall properly
prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act or any
other federal, state or foreign Laws relating to the Mergers or as may be
necessary to obtain the consent or approval of any Governmental Entity
requiring in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). The Company and Parent shall
cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all
such Other Filings, including by providing copies of all relevant documents
to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to the filing.  Neither the
Company nor Parent shall consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory
deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each of the parties to this
Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties of the receipt of any
comments on, or any request for amendments or supplements to, any of the

each of the parties to this Agreement shall supply the other parties with
copies of all correspondence between it and each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the members of its staff or
any other appropriate governmental official, on the other hand, with respect
to any of the Other Filings.  Each of the parties hereto shall promptly
obtain and furnish the other parties with (a) the information which may be
reasonably required in order to make such Other Filings and (b) any
additional information which may be requested by a Governmental Entity and

reasonable requests for estoppels; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company
will not be required to seek any estoppels in a form different from the form
attached to the applicable lease, if any; _provided_   _further_ that the
failure to obtain any such estoppels shall not be considered to be a breach
of this Agreement.

  

(b) The Company and the Operating Partnership shall give prompt notice to the
Purchaser Parties and the Purchaser Parties shall give prompt notice to the
Company and the Operating Partnership, if (i) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality

parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

  

(c) If, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Parent undertakes an underwritten public offering of Parent Common Stock that

Company and the Company Subsidiaries in the related registration statement
and prospectus, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its independent auditor to provide to Parent the consents necessary to
include such financial statements in such registration statement and
prospectus. In addition, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its independent
auditor to, cooperate with Parent as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with such offering.

  

Section 6.4. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in Section 8.2,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions

costs and expenses of agents, Representatives, counsel and accountants shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees, costs or expenses.

  

Section 6.5. _No Solicitations_.

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and
the Operating Partnership shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of
the Company Subsidiaries, or any of its or their officers, trustees,
directors, partners, Affiliates or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant, agent or other
representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
** _Company Representatives_** "), directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way

  



        
   

  



  

of furnishing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers or any other
efforts or attempts that constitute or that reasonably may be expected to
lead to, a Competing Proposal or (ii) initiate or participate in any
discussions or negotiations (other than to seek clarifications with respect
to the Competing Proposal) regarding, or that reasonably may be expected to
lead to, a Competing Proposal or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal or enter into any merger
agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement relating to a Competing Proposal, or
enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company
or the Operating Partnership to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder
or resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing, except as
contemplated in Section 6.5(d). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall be responsible for any failure on the part of its Company
Representatives to comply with this Section 6.5.

  

(b) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, at any time prior
to the receipt of the Company **** Shareholder Approval, if the Company
receives a _bona fide_  written Competing Proposal from a third party (which
was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in violation of
Section 6.5(a)) after the date hereof, the Company (x) may furnish, or cause
to be furnished, non-public information with respect to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Competing Proposal and to
its financing sources and Persons or entities working in concert with it
(collectively, a " ** _Third Party_** "), and (y) may participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Competing Proposal, if, in the
case of either clause (x) or (y): (A) prior to taking such action, the
Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with the Person who made such
Competing Proposal with respect to such Competing Proposal that is
substantially similar (except for the absence of standstill provisions) to
the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of July 5, 2007 between the Company
and Parent (the " ** _Confidentiality Agreement_** "), and (B) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal is,
or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal.

  

(c) The Company and the Operating Partnership shall provide prompt (within
twenty-four (24) hours following receipt thereof) oral and written notice to
Parent of (i) the receipt of any Competing Proposal, or any material
modification or amendment to any Competing Proposal, by the Company, the
Operating Partnership, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative,
(ii) a copy of any documents or agreements provided in contemplation of such
Competing Proposal (including any amendments, supplements or modifications
thereto but excluding any financing documents or agreements it is not
permitted to deliver as a result of confidentiality restrictions), and (iii)
the identity of such Person or entity making any such Competing Proposal. The
Company and the Operating Partnership shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a current basis, to the extent reasonably practicable, but in any event as
promptly as practicable, of the status and material details (including any
change to the material terms and conditions) of any such Competing Proposal.
 The Company and the Operating Partnership shall not, and shall cause each
of the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the
Company or the Operating Partnership from providing such information to
Parent.

  

(d) Subject to this paragraph (d) and to Section 8.1(e), neither the Company
Board nor any committee of the Company Board may (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, or the approval or
recommendation of any committee of the Company Board of the Merger or of any
other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve, recommend or

  



        
   

  



  

endorse, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or endorse, a Competing
Proposal (any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) being referred to as an
" ** _Adverse Recommendation Change_** ", it being agreed that the taking of
any of the actions contemplated by Section 6.5(b), (c) or (f) shall not
constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an Adverse Recommendation Change) or
(iii) authorize or permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding (each, an " **
_Acquisition Agreement_** ") contemplating, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement in compliance with Section 6.5(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board or a committee of the Company Board may (1) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change for reasons not related to the receipt of a Competing
Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors duties
to the Company or its stockholders under applicable Law or (2) in response to
a _bona fide_ written Competing Proposal (which was not solicited, initiated,
encouraged or facilitated in violation of Section 6.5(a)) made after the date
hereof take an action referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above and, in
the case of clause (iii), terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
8.1(e) if, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that such
Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (a " ** _Subsequent
Determination_** "); **_provided_** **,** ** _however_** , that such actions
may only be taken at a time that is after (I) the third (3rd) Business
Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the Company that the
Company Board is prepared to take such action, and (II) at the end of such
period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after taking into account
all amendments or revisions committed to by Parent and after consultation
with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Competing Proposal remains a Superior Proposal relative to the Merger, as
supplemented by any Counterproposal. Any such written notice shall specify
the material terms and conditions of such applicable Competing Proposal,
include the most current version of any Acquisition Agreement (including any
amendments, supplements or modifications thereto), identify the person making
such Competing Proposal and state that the Company Board otherwise intends to
make a Subsequent Determination (subject to compliance with this subsection
(d)). During any such three Business Day period, Parent shall be entitled to
deliver to the Company a counterproposal to such Competing Proposal (a " **
_Counterproposal_** "). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material amendment to any material term of a Competing Proposal
which amendment affects the determination of whether the Competing Proposal
is a Superior Proposal to any Counterproposal shall be treated as a new
Competing Proposal for the purposes of this Section 6.5(d) (requiring a new
written notice by the Company and a new three Business Day period). For
purposes of clarification, the statement by the Company that it has received
a Competing Proposal, that its Board will consider such Competing Proposal
and that its Board continues to recommend this Agreement pending such
consideration shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

(e) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company, the Operating Partnership
and the Company Subsidiaries shall cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions, solicitations
or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to a
Competing Proposal by or on behalf of the Company, the Operating Partnership
or any of the Company Representatives. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause (including by written request) each Person with whom it
has executed a confidentiality agreement within the twelve months prior to
the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Competing
Proposal to return or destroy all confidential or other non-
public information

  



        
   

  



  

heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company, the
Operating Partnership or any of the Company Representatives.

  

(f) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, the Company Board
may at any time take and disclose to its holders of Company Common Shares a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, may issue a stop, look and listen announcement and may make any
disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A; **_provided_** **,** ** _however_** , that neither
the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted to recommend a Competing
Proposal which is not a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, any public statements by the Company commenting
on the merits of a Competing Proposal shall be an Adverse Recommendation
Change other than (A) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (B) an
express rejection of a Competing Proposal or (C) an express reaffirmation of
the Company Recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Mergers.

  

(g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent or any of its Affiliates and other than in connection with
an Acquisition Agreement following a Subsequent Determination) from
the restrictions on "control share acquisitions" contained in the Maryland
Control Share Acquisition Act, as amended (or any similar provisions of the
MRL) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply.

  

Section 6.6. _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_.

  

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation existing
in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present
and former director, partner, trustee and officer of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries provided for in the respective declarations of
trust, charters or bylaws (or other applicable organizational documents)
shall survive the Mergers (and, with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that is not the surviving entity of the Mergers, shall be
reflected in the applicable organizational documents of each such entity) and
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time and all other indemnification agreements and arrangements in
effect as of the date hereof shall remain in effect in accordance with their
terms; **_provided_** **,** ** _however_** , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any claims (each a " ** _Claim_** ")
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Claim.

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in
respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former trustee, partner,
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together
with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " ** _Indemnified
Party_** ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred
whether before or at the Effective Time (including without limitation the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in connection with such persons
serving as an officer, trustee, partner, director or other fiduciary of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any entity if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of the Company.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Subject to Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to, and shall, purchase a
"tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the
Mergers), of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the directors and officers of the
Company as the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries existing policy or
policies, and from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, for the
benefit of the current and former officers and directors of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary with a claims period of six years from the
Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
for claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time. If the Company is unable to obtain the "tail" insurance
described in the first sentence of this Section 6.6(c) for an amount equal to
or less than the maximum premium set forth in Section 6.6(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company shall be entitled to obtain as much
comparable "tail" insurance as possible for an amount equal to such maximum
premium.

  

(d) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall survive the Mergers and
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 6.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.6 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

  

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company or such transferees, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

  

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may
have under any organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification
agreement or arrangement, applicable Law or otherwise. The agreements and
covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other
rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.6 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

  

Section 6.7. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.  From the date hereof
until the Effective Time, each party hereto and its respective Subsidiaries
shall afford to the other and such other partys directors, trustees,
officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors, lenders, agents and other
representatives of the other party (collectively, the " _Representatives_
") reasonable access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours without undue interruption (and will request the same from the
other partys auditors, attorneys, financial advisors and lenders) to (a)
the properties, offices, books, records and contracts of the other party and
the other partys Subsidiaries and (b) the officers and employees of the
other party and the other partys Subsidiaries.  Each party shall furnish
reasonably promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (ii) all
other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business as the
other party may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party
shall be required by this Section 6.7 to provide any of

  



        
   

  



  

the Company, Parent or their respective Representatives, as the case may be,
with (x) access to physical properties for the purpose of invasive physical
testing **** or (y) any information such party reasonably believes it may not
provide to any other party by reason of applicable law, rules or regulations,
which constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or
which such party is required to keep confidential by reason of contract or
agreement with third parties. Such other party shall, in the exercise of the
rights described in this Section 6.7, not unduly interfere with the operation
of the businesses of the party providing the access and information. No
investigation conducted under this Section 6.7 will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made in this Agreement. Prior to the
Effective Time, each party shall cause each of its Representatives to hold in
confidence all such information on the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

Section 6.8. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Mergers and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or
make such public statement as may be required by Law or the applicable rules
of any national securities exchange on which the Company Common Shares are
listed if the party issuing such press release or making such public
statement has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the
other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do
so prior to the time such press release or public statement or filing is
required to be released or furnished pursuant to such Law or rules. In this
regard, the parties shall make a joint public announcement of the Mergers
contemplated hereby no later than the opening of trading on the NYSE on the
Business Day immediately following the time at which this Agreement is signed
and such joint public announcement shall be in form and substance mutually
satisfactory to the parties hereto.

  

Section 6.9. _Employee Benefit Arrangements_.

  

(a) For the one-year period immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Company shall provide each employee of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries who remain employed by Parent, the Surviving Company or
the Subsidiaries of Parent after the Effective Time (each, a " ** _Covered
Employee_** ") compensation and employee benefits in the aggregate that are
substantially similar to the compensation and employee benefits provided to
such Covered Employee immediately before the Effective Time, excluding equity
and equity based plans and awards of interests in the Operating Partnership
provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to
each such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
**_provided_** **,** ** _however_** , that nothing contained in this Section
6.9 (subject to Section 6.9(c)) or elsewhere in the Agreement (including
Section 9.9 hereof) shall be construed to prevent, from and after the
Effective Time, the termination of employment of any Covered Employee or the
amendment or termination of any particular Employee Program in accordance
with its terms.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
following the Effective Time, the employment of the Covered Employees who are
covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall in all events be in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreements.

  

(b) All service credited to each Covered Employee under the Employee Programs
by the Company through the Effective Time shall be recognized by Parent and
the Surviving Company for all purposes, including for purposes
of eligibility, vesting, benefit accruals (but excluding benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan) and level of benefits under any
employee benefit plan provided by Parent and the Surviving Company. With
respect to any welfare benefit plan established or maintained by Parent or
the Surviving Company for the benefit of Covered

  



        
   

  



  

Employees and their eligible dependants, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusions, eligibility waiting
periods, and evidence of insurability requirements (to the same extent such
limitations, waiting periods, or evidence of insurability requirements would
not have applied under the relevant Employee Program) and provide that any
covered expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time in respect of the
current plan year by Covered Employees (or any covered dependent of such an
employee) shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, offset, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions (or
similar payment or limitations) after the Effective Time in respect of such
current plan year.

  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.9 to the contrary, for
the one year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each Company Subsidiary to maintain in effect the
severance plans applicable to Company Employees as set forth in Section
5.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule without any amendment thereto that
would be adverse to participants.

  

(d) No provision of this Section 6.9 shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) with Parent, the Surviving
Company or the Subsidiaries of Parent and no provision of this Section 6.9
shall create such rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that
may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Employee Program or any
plan or arrangement which may be established by Parent, the Surviving Company
or any of the Subsidiaries of Parent.

  

Section 6.10. _Financing_.

  

(a) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to provide, all reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent ( ** _provided_** that such requested co-operation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and
due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be
reasonably requested by Parent of a type and form customarily included in
private placements pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (iii)
assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) an
offering document for any debt raised to complete the Mergers and (B)
materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with
the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any debt raised
by Parent to complete the Mergers, (v) forming new direct or indirect
Subsidiaries, and (vi) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent; **_provided_** that without the Companys consent, in no
event, whether in connection with the financings contemplated by the
Financing Agreements or otherwise, shall any property-level due
diligence involve environmental tests or assessments; **_provided_** **,** **
_further_** that the foregoing shall not be deemed to require the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, prior to the Effective Time, to consummate any
tender offer or consent solicitation with respect to, or enter into any
supplemental indenture with respect to or otherwise amend the terms of any
instruments governing, any existing outstanding Indebtedness of the Company
or its Subsidiaries. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them prior to the
Effective Time in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries

  



        
   

  



  

and information provided by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the
Company Representatives) (it being agreed that this sentence shall survive
termination of this Agreement).

  

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment
Letters, and to satisfy the conditions to obtaining the Financing set forth
therein, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to
the Financing as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (collectively,
the " ** _Financing Agreements_** "), so that the Financing Agreements are in
effect as promptly as practicable, and (iii) consummate the financings
contemplated by the Financing Agreements at or prior to the Closing. Parent
shall keep the Company informed of the status of the financing process
relating thereto. If, notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable
efforts by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.10, any of
the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements expire, are terminated or
otherwise become unavailable prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for
any reason, Parent shall (i) immediately notify the Company of such
expiration, termination or other unavailability and the reasons therefor and
(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts promptly to arrange for
alternative financing to replace the financing contemplated by such expired,
terminated or otherwise unavailable commitments or agreements in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
such event, the term "Debt Commitment Letters" and similar terms shall refer
to such replacement financing. Parent agrees that the matters set forth on
Section 6.10 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute
conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding
the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to
paragraph (a) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

Section 6.11. _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Parent and the Company shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Common Shares to be de-
listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act promptly
following the Effective Time.

  

Section 6.12. _Transfer and Gains Taxes_. Parent and the Company will
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and
stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any
similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related interests,
penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer and Gains Taxes_ "), and shall
cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer and Gains Taxes.
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and Gains Taxes (other than
such Transfer and Gains Taxes that are solely the responsibility of the
holders of Company Common Shares or OP Units under applicable Law), without
any deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Shares.

  

Section 6.13. _Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the Mergers to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

and acknowledge that Parent and its Affiliates shall be permitted to
market, solicit and cause the sale of one (1) or more of the Company
Properties or other assets of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
between the date hereof and the Closing Date (the " _Asset Sales_ "), with
such Asset Sales to be consummated, at the election of Parent, immediately
prior to (and conditioned upon the Mergers) or simultaneously with the

  



        
   

  



  

Mergers; _provided_ , that Parent shall cause any potential buyers in
connection with such Asset Sales to enter into a confidentiality agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Company and that in no event shall the Company
or any Company Subsidiary be obligated to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such marketing or solicitation shall be (i)
reasonably acceptable to the Company, (ii) implemented in a manner that does
not disrupt the operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (iii)
paid for at Parents sole cost and expense and that the sales price of any
such Company Property being sold in an Asset Sale shall be at or above the
then fair market value for such Company Property. The Company agrees that
subject to the foregoing, in the case of any Company Properties referenced as
"Special Sales Properties" in Section 5.1(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, an Asset Sale so arranged by Parent may be consummated at the
election of Parent prior to the Mergers if such Asset Sale would be for cash
consideration at or above the applicable amount set forth on such Schedule
and if such Asset Sale is otherwise on customary commercial terms.  Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Company informed on a
current basis as to Parents efforts to market one or more Company Properties
and arrange for Asset Sales, including furnishing copies of any written
inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation with respect thereto.
Parent shall provide the Company with at least twenty-four (24) hours prior
written notice before any of Parents Representatives conducts marketing or
solicitation activities at any of the Company Properties and, if the Company
requests, Parents Representative(s) shall be accompanied by one or more
Representatives of the Company while conducting marketing or solicitation
activities at such Company Property. The Company shall, and shall cause each
of the Company Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Parent to effect such Asset Sales; _provided_ , that
the Company shall not have any obligation to incur any expense in so doing,
unless Parent undertakes in writing to promptly reimburse all such expenses
and provides reasonable assurance of performance.

  

Section 6.15. _Consents and Modifications_. The Company shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary to, fully cooperate with all reasonable requests by
the Purchaser Parties in connection with obtaining all consents, approvals
or amendments to, or other modifications of, any or all Indebtedness and
Major Leases of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that the Purchaser
Parties may deem (and the terms of which the Purchaser Parties may deem), in
their sole discretion, advisable to obtain (the " _Consents or Modifications_
"), including, but not limited to, providing access to tenants, sub-
tenants, lenders, servicers, special servicers, rating agencies and their
respective counsel and other advisers and other relevant parties
(collectively, the " _Company Major Agreement Parties_ ") with respect to any
Indebtedness and Major Leases and executing all documents or agreements in
connection with obtaining the Consents and Modifications (the " _Modification
Documents)_. In addition to, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company (a) hereby grants consent, and shall cause each
Company Subsidiary to grant consent, concurrently herewith, to the Purchaser
Parties (and their respective agents and counsel) to, in coordination and
consultation with the Company, to enter into discussions with the Company
Major Agreements Parties for the purpose of obtaining the Consents or
Modifications and the Modification Documents. The Purchaser Parties agree
that (i) except with the consent of the Company, no Consent or Modification
or Modification Document will be effective prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
the Purchaser Parties will pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with
obtaining the Consents or Modifications (provided, however, with respect to
Major Leases, the Purchaser Parties will only be required to pay the
Companys out-of-pocket costs and expenses paid to counterparties), and (iii)
the Purchaser Parties shall keep the Company informed on a current basis to
the extent reasonably practicable of all material contacts with the Company
Major Agreements Parties and material developments with respect thereto.

Closing Date:

  

(a) **_Representations and Warranties_**. The representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in (i) Section 3.3(a) shall be true and correct in

Share Merger Consideration payable as a result of such untruth, breach or

where the failure of any such representation and warranty to be so true and
correct would not have, and would not reasonably be likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, in each
case as of the date of this Agreement and as of Closing as though made on the
Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties

qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with the Companys
taxable year ended December 31, 2002, through its taxable year ending
December 31, 2007, and (ii) the ownership and current and proposed method of
operations of the Company as represented by the Company will enable the
Company to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Code during its taxable
year beginning January 1, 2008 through the Closing (determined without taking
into account, or giving effect to, any transactions undertaken pursuant to
Sections 2.8, 2.9 or 6.14 of this Agreement, and assuming that, until the
later of the Closing and the end of the Companys taxable year in which the
Closing occurs, the Companys ownership and current and proposed method of
operations as represented by the Company will enable the Company to continue
to satisfy the requirements for such qualification and taxation as a REIT
under the Code).  In rendering the opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to
make assumptions and receive and rely on customary representations from the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Such opinion shall contain a Circular
230 legend.

  

Section 7.3. _Additional Conditions to Obligations of the Company and the

respects; (ii) the last sentence of Section 4.8 (Absence of Certain Changes)
shall be true and correct in all respects; and (iii) all other sections of

therein), except where the failure of any such representation or warranty to
be so true and correct would not have, and would not reasonably be likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, in
each case, as of the date of this Agreement and as

  



        
   

  



  

of Closing as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which
case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct only on
and as of such earlier date).

Sheet, except as set forth in (i) any Covered Parent SEC Disclosure or (ii)
in any Section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there has not been a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

(d) **_Certificate_**. The Company shall have received a certificate signed

rendering the opinion, such counsel shall be entitled to receive and rely on
customary representations from the Parent and its Subsidiaries.

applicable materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifications set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b)) then the Company shall pay
to Parent, or as directed by Parent, promptly, but in no event later than two
(2) Business Days after such termination, an amount equal to the Parent
Expense Amount; or

  

(iv) (A) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any Qualifying Competing
Proposal or the _bona fide_ intention of any Person to make a
Qualifying Competing Proposal is publicly proposed or publicly disclosed, and

equal to the Parent Expense Amount.

  

For purposes of this Agreement, (I) the " _Break-Up Fee_ " shall be an amount

$18.0 million and (III) the " _Company Expense Amount_ " shall be $14.0
million.

  

(c) Parent agrees (i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections
8.1(b)(ii) or 8.1(g), then Parent shall, promptly after such termination (but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days following such termination), pay
to the Company the Company Expense Amount and (ii) if this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d), and in the case of a termination
pursuant to Section 8.1(d), such termination was a result of a failure of a
representation and warranty to be true and correct when made as of the date
hereof or as a result of a breach of a covenant contained in this Agreement
(in each case subject to applicable materiality or Parent Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualifications set forth in Section 7.3(a) or (b)) then
Parent shall pay to the Company, or as directed by the Company, promptly, but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days after such termination, an
amount equal to the Company Expense Amount.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
the Company and the Operating Partnership (if applicable) fail to pay to

Parent fails to pay to the Company any amounts due under this Section 8.2,
Parent shall reimburse the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal
fees and expenses) in connection with any successful action, including the
filing of any lawsuit or other legal action taken to collect payment and
shall pay interest thereon at the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum accruing from
the date such amount should have been paid until payment thereof.

  

(f) The Company and the Operating Partnership acknowledge that the agreements
contained in Section 8.2(b) are an integral part of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement.  Parent acknowledges that the agreements
contained in Section 8.2(c) are an integral part of this transaction
contemplated by the Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
Company and the Operating Partnership would not enter into this Agreement.
Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that the Break-Up Fee is not a penalty, but rather
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such amount is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision.

  

Section 8.3. _Escrow of Break-Up Fee_.

  

(a) In the event that the Company and the Operating Partnership
(if applicable) are obligated to pay the Break-Up Fee set forth in Section
8.2(b), the Company and the Operating Partnership (if applicable) shall pay
to Parent from the amounts deposited into escrow in accordance with the next
sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Break-Up Fee and (ii) the
sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing
Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" **
_Qualifying Income_** "), as determined by Parents independent certified
public accountants, plus (2) in the event Parent receives a letter from
Parents counsel indicating that Parent has received either a ruling from the
IRS or an opinion of outside counsel, in each case, described in Section
8.3(b), an amount equal to the Break-Up Fee less the amount payable under
clause (1) above. To secure the Companys and the Operating Partnerships (if
applicable) obligation to pay these amounts, the Company shall deposit into
escrow an amount in cash equal to the Break-Up Fee with an escrow agent
selected by the Company and on such terms (subject to Section 8.3(b)) as
shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent.
The payment or deposit into escrow of the Break-Up Fee pursuant to
this Section 8.3(a) shall be made at the time the Company is obligated
to pay Parent such amount pursuant to Section 8.2(b) of this Agreement
by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Break-Up Fee in escrow or any
portion thereof shall not be released to Parent unless the escrow
agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from
Parents independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum
amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing Parent
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income or a subsequent letter from Parents accountants revising that amount,
in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a
letter from Parents general counsel indicating that Parent received a ruling
from the IRS or an opinion of outside counsel, in either case, to the effect
that the receipt by Parent of

        
   

  

the Break-Up Fee (x) would constitute Qualifying Income, (y) would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code, or (z) would not otherwise cause Parent to fail to qualify as a
REIT, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Break-Up Fee to Parent. The escrow agreement shall provide that (i) any
portion of the Break-Up Fee held in escrow for five years shall be released
by the escrow agent to the Company and (ii) for federal income tax purposes,
the Company shall be treated as the beneficial owner of all amounts held in
escrow pursuant to the escrow agreement.

  

(c) In the event that Parent is obligated to pay the Company Expense Amount
set forth in Section 8.2, the provisions contained in Sections 8.3(a) and (b)
shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_ , by treating all references to "Parent" as
references to "the Company," treating all references to "the Company" as
reference to "Parent" and treating all references to "Break-Up Fee" as
references to "Company Expense Amount."

Parent Shareholder Approval or Required Limited Partners Approval has been

Parents stockholders without obtaining such approval.

the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the provisions of Section 8.4, waive

contained herein.  Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to
be enforced. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 9.4. _Interpretation_. The headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.  Wherever used herein, a pronoun in the
masculine gender shall be considered as including the feminine gender unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation" regardless whether such words
are included.

  

Section 9.5. _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time. This Section 9.5 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of
the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time or relates to the delivery of the Exchange Fund in full, each of which
shall survive the Effective Time.

  

Section 9.6. _Remedies; Specific Performance_.  The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement (including,
without limitation,

        
   

  

Section 6.1(d)) were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any federal or state court located in the
State of Maryland, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Parties agree
that the Company shall have the right to cause the Purchaser Parties to
enforce their rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and to require the
Lenders to honor the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters.

  

Section 9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
Parent Disclosure Schedule, _constitutes_ the entire agreement among the
parties and supersedes all of the prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

  

Section 9.8. _Assignment_. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that each of the Purchaser
Parties may delegate or assign (without any further consent of any parties)
all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates,
provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party
of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

Section 9.9. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (i) the provisions of
Sections 2.8, 2.9, 6.6 and 6.10(a) hereof which shall inure to the benefit of
the Persons benefiting therefrom, (ii) the provisions of Article II
concerning payment of Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the
Partnership Merger Consideration, the Other Payments and Option Consideration
which shall inure to the benefit of the holders of Company Common Shares, OP
Units and Company Share Options who are in each case expressly intended to be
third-party beneficiaries thereof, and (iii) the right of the Company, on
behalf of the holders of equity interests in the Company to pursue damages in
the event of any of the Purchaser Parties breach of this Agreement, which
right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by the Purchaser Parties, nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer on any
Person other than the parties hereto or their respective heirs, successors,
executors, administrators and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

Section 9.10. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid
or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected
thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be
severable.

  

Section 9.11. _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

(a) The Mergers shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Maryland without regard to its rules of conflict of laws
(except to the extent the laws of the State of Delaware are applicable to the
Partnership Merger). Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without regard
to its rules of conflict of laws.

  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Maryland or any court of

        
   

  

the United States located in the State of Maryland (the " ** _Maryland
Courts_** ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and agrees not to
plead or claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has
been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees,
(a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of process
in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of
Maryland as such partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and (b) that
service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid certified mail
with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b)
above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such
party personally within the State of Maryland.

  

Section 9.12. _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

  

Section 9.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto
(a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney or any other has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 9.13.

  

Section 9.14. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party. Facsimile or other electronic
transmission of any signed original document shall be deemed the same as
delivery of an original.

 **UPSIDE PARTICIPATION 
 IN 
 THE HELD FOR SALE ASSETS**

  



       

**Additional Consideration**

    |  



    |  

As  additional cash merger consideration, the Companys shareholders will
be  entitled to receive 50% of the Incremental Sales Proceeds from the sale
of  any asset that is part of the Modified Held for Sale Portfolio which is 
identified on Exhibit A, provided the consummation of any such sales occur 
prior to or substantially simultaneously with the effective time of the 
merger. The Additional Consideration will be payable to the Companys 
shareholders as additional cash merger consideration at the time of the 
closing of the Merger. In no event will the transactions contemplated by
this  Exhibit result in a reduction of the merger consideration. The Company
will  market for sale the Modified Held for Sale Portfolio as provided for in
the  Merger Agreement. The Additional Consideration shall be subject to a
maximum  amount of $0.25 per Company Common Share.

**Incremental Sales Proceeds**

    |  



    |  

Incremental  Sales Proceeds shall be equal to the positive difference, if
any, between Net  Sales Proceeds and the Agreed Upon Floor calculated on an
aggregate basis for  each sale of a property within the Modified Held for
Sale Portfolio  consummated prior to or substantially simultaneously with the
effective time  of the merger. For purposes of clarification, if one or more
a properties are  sold for an amount below the Agreed Upon Floor (as defined
below) for such  properties, unless Purchaser has approved the lower sales
price for purposes  of this Upside Participation in connection with such
sale, the difference  between the actual Net Sales Proceeds of such
properties and the Agreed Upon  Floor for such properties will be subtracted
from the total Net Sales  Proceeds from all properties sold for an amount
above their respective Agreed  Upon Floor in determining the Incremental
Sales Proceeds.

**Net Sales Proceeds**

    |  



    |  

Net Sales Proceeds shall  be defined as the gross cash proceeds from any sale
of a property within the  Modified Held for Sale Portfolio (plus any
liabilities assumed by the  purchaser or to which the property is subject)
less all applicable  transaction costs, including, but not limited to, legal
fees, title costs,  brokerage fees, transfer taxes, seller retained
liabilities, cash or other  concessions given at closing, debt assumption
fees, debt prepayment penalties  or defeasance penalties, release premiums on
indebtedness, excise tax, and  any income tax obligations resulting from the
sale of any property within the  Modified Held for Sale Portfolio.

**Agreed Upon Floor**

    |  



    |  

The Agreed Upon Floor,  which is provided on Exhibit A, shall be subject to
increase, on a dollar for  dollar basis, for expenditures and other amounts
incurred or paid with  respect to the relevant property occurring between
October 1, 2007 and the  effective time of the merger, including, but not
limited to, real estate  taxes, net operating costs, debt service (if the
sold property is encumbered  by portfolio-wide debt, then for purposes of
determining debt service, the  property shall be deemed encumbered by debt
equal to the release amount),  tenant improvements, leasing commissions, base
building capital, legal fees,  and other tenant concessions or inducements.
