AND PLAN OF MERGER    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement")
is entered into as of the 9th day of September, 2001, by and among
BANKATLANTIC BANCORP, INC., a Florida corporation ("BBC"), CSB MERGER SUB,
INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBC ("Merger
Sub"), and COMMUNITY SAVINGS BANKSHARES, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Community Bankshares").    W I T N E S S E T H: 
--------------------   WHEREAS, the parties desire that Community Bankshares
be acquired by BBC through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Community
Bankshares (the "Merger") upon the terms and conditions contained herein and
in accordance with applicable law;   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of
BBC and Community Bankshares have each determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective shareholders for BBC to acquire Community
Bankshares in the Merger, and have each adopted a resolution approving this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and   WHEREAS,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement to BBC
to enter into this Agreement, the directors, executive officers and certain
shareholders of Community Bankshares have entered into a voting agreement
(the "Voting Agreement") pursuant to which such shareholders, among other
things, have agreed to vote the outstanding shares of Community Bankshares\'
common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Community Bankshares Common
Stock"), owned or controlled by them in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and the Merger contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth therein.   NOW, THEREFORE, for and in
consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements, representations,
warranties and covenants herein contained and for the purpose of prescribing
the terms and conditions of the Merger, the parties, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 MERGER. At
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into Community Bankshares and Community Bankshares will be the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"),
in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement and
the Certificate of Merger (as defined in Section 1.2).   1.2 CONSUMMATION
OF THE MERGER; EFFECTIVE TIME. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Stearns Weaver Miller Weissler Alhadeff and Sitterson, P.A.,
150 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida 33130, at such time as shall be fixed
by mutual agreement of BBC and Community Bankshares as promptly as
practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the parties shall cause the Merger to become effective on the
date of the Closing by executing, acknowledging and filing in accordance with
all applicable regulations, a Certificate of Merger with respect to the
Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware which shall provide that the Merger shall be effective as of the
date of Closing (the date and time of such effectiveness being referred to
herein as the "Effective Time"). The Closing shall be deemed to occur
simultaneously with the Effective Time.   1.3 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the
Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the
applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the "DGCL"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Community Bankshares and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Community
Bankshares and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.   1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS.
The Certificate of Incorporation of Community Bankshares as in effect
immediately prior to the Merger shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation. The by-laws of Community Bankshares as in effect
immediately prior to the Merger shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter altered, amended or repealed in accordance with
applicable law.   1.5 BOARD OF DIRECTORS. As of the Effective Time, the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist of the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.   1.6 OFFICERS. As
of the Effective Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall constitute the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until such time as their respective successors have been elected and
qualified.   1.7 THE BANK MERGER. Community Bankshares and BBC acknowledge
and agree that immediately following the Merger, BBC shall cause the merger
(the "Bank Merger") of Community Savings, F. A., a federally chartered stock
form savings association and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Community
Bankshares ("Community Savings"), with and into BankAtlantic, a Federal
Savings Bank, a federally chartered stock form savings bank and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of BBC ("BankAtlantic"), with BankAtlantic as the surviving
bank of the Bank Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation. The Bank Merger will be effective immediately following the
Effective Time on the same calendar day as the Closing.   1.8 PRIOR
APPROVALS. The parties hereto acknowledge that requisite approvals or waivers
must be received from or notices must be given to certain federal and state
regulatory agencies. Such regulatory agencies may include the Office of
Thrift Supervision (the "OTS"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(the "FDIC"); and any other governmental agency or regulatory authorities
having jurisdiction over BBC, Community Bankshares, BankAtlantic or Community
Savings, as the case may be (collectively, the "Applicable Governmental
Authorities"). The transactions contemplated hereby are subject to and
conditioned upon the receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals
or waivers, the filing of all required notices and the expiration of any
required waiting periods and, to the extent received or accepted, such
approvals, waivers or notices shall not contain or be subject to any terms or
conditions (other than those generally imposed in similar transactions) which
BBC reasonably deems to be burdensome.   ARTICLE II  CONVERSION OF SHARES;
PURCHASE PRICE   2.1 PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price to be paid in
exchange for each issued and outstanding share of Community Bankshares Common
Stock shall be an amount equal to $19.00 per share of Community Bankshares
Common Stock (the "Per Share Amount").   2.2 CONVERSION OF COMMUNITY
BANKSHARES COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS.   (a) At the Effective Time, each share
of Community Bankshares Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares as such term is defined
in Section 2.5 hereof) and other than shares of Community Bankshares Common
Stock then owned by Community Bankshares (including shares held in treasury),
any Subsidiary (as such term is defined in Section 4.4 hereof) of Community
Bankshares, BBC, or any Subsidiary of BBC (in each case other than in a
fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive the Per
Share Amount.   (b) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase a share
of Community Bankshares Common Stock (each an "Option" and, collectively, the
"Options") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive in cash
an amount equal to the Per Share Amount minus the price per share of
Community Bankshares Common Stock at which such Option is exercisable (the
"Per Option Amount").   2.3 EFFECT OF CONVERSION OF SHARES AND OPTIONS.
After the Effective Time, and until surrendered for payment, each outstanding
certificate which, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Community Bankshares Common Stock (each, a "Certificate"), shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Amount
multiplied by the number of shares of Community Bankshares Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate. After the Effective Time, each
Option shall be deemed for all purposes to be canceled and converted into and
represent only the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the product of
the Per Option Amount applicable to such Option multiplied by the number of
shares of Community Bankshares Common Stock for which such Option is
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. In any matters relating
to such Certificates or Options, BBC may rely conclusively upon the record of
security holders maintained by the registrar and transfer agent for the
Community Bankshares Common Stock or by Community Bankshares containing the
names and addresses of the holders of record of Community Bankshares
Common Stock or Options at the Effective Time. The aggregate consideration to
be paid for the Community Bankshares Common Stock and Options is referred to
herein as the "Merger Consideration."   2.4 PROCEDURES FOR EXCHANGE OF
COMMUNITY BANKSHARES COMMON STOCK AND OPTIONS.   (a) BBC shall take all
steps reasonably necessary on and as of the Effective Time to deliver to an
exchange agent designated by BBC and reasonably acceptable to Community
Bankshares (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and the holders of Options, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 2.4, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to
be paid in exchange for outstanding Community Bankshares Common Stock and
Options in accordance with this Agreement (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange
Agent shall act as agent on behalf of BBC and record holders (each a "Record
Holder") of Community Bankshares Common Stock and Options at the Effective
Time, other than Community Bankshares, any Subsidiary of Community
Bankshares, BBC, or any Subsidiary of BBC (in each case other than in a
fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted), or
any holder of Dissenting Shares.   (b) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event more than five business days after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each Record Holder of a
Certificate or an Option a form letter of transmittal which, among other
matters, shall specify how such Record Holder shall receive payment of the
Merger Consideration that such Record Holder is eligible to receive. After
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a properly executed letter of transmittal
and, in the case of Record Holders of shares of Community Bankshares Common
Stock, the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares of Community
Bankshares Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the person in
whose name such Community Bankshares Common Stock or Options shall have been
registered, the Merger Consideration to which such Record Holder shall have
become entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. There shall be
no obligation to deliver the Merger Consideration in respect of any shares
of Community Bankshares Common Stock until (and then only to the extent that)
the holder thereof surrenders its Certificate or Certificates for exchange
as provided in this Section 2.4, or, in lieu thereof, delivers to the
Exchange Agent an appropriate affidavit of loss and an indemnity agreement
and/or a bond as may be required in any such case by the Exchange Agent. If
any payment for shares of Community Bankshares Common Stock or Options is to
be made in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered for
exchange or the Option, as the case may be, is registered, it shall be a
condition to the payment that, in the case of holders of shares of Community
Bankshares Common Stock, the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and, in the case of holders
of Options, the special instructions in the letter of transmittal shall have
been complied with, and in each case that the person requesting the payment
shall either: (i) pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or the Option or (ii) establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes have been paid or are not
payable.   (c) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Community Bankshares of the
Community Bankshares Common Stock nor shall there be any further exercises of
Options which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing such shares
or any Options are presented for transfer or exercise, respectively, to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and
canceled as provided in this Article II.   (d) At any time following the
six-month period after the Effective Time, BBC shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which
had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Options (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look to BBC (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger
Consideration that may be payable with respect to the Certificates or Options
held by them; provided, however, that the Exchange Agent shall not deliver to
BBC any portion of the Exchange Fund payable to the holders of Certificates
who have theretofore surrendered their Certificates and a duly executed and
completed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither BBC nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a Certificate or an Option for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such Certificate or Option, respectively, to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.   (e) The
Exchange Agent or BBC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Certificates or Options such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the rules and regulations
thereunder (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Law (as
defined below). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Exchange
Agent or BBC, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificates or Options in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   2.5
DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary and unless otherwise provided by applicable law, each share
of Community Bankshares Common Stock which is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is owned by a shareholder
who, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL duly exercises his or her right to
dissent with respect to his or her shares (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall
not be converted into the right to receive, or be exchangeable for, the
Merger Consideration, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to
payment from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, each share of
Community Bankshares Common Stock of such holder shall thereupon no longer be
deemed a Dissenting Share and shall automatically be converted into and shall
thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to receive the Per Share Amount
as provided in this Agreement.   2.6 CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK.
At the Effective Time, each share of the Common Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") that is issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time shall thereafter represent one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving
Corporation.    ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BBC   BBC
represents and warrants to Community Bankshares as follows:   3.1
ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. BBC is a corporation duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of the State of Florida whose status is
active. Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of BBC and Merger
Sub has all necessary corporate power to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to own its respective properties and assets and to carry on its respective
business as now conducted.   3.2 AUTHORIZATION AND NO VIOLATION. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by BBC and Merger Sub and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of BBC and
Merger Sub and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, this
Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of BBC and
Merger Sub, enforceable against them in accordance with its terms, except as
limited by (x) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance laws and other similar laws affecting creditors\' rights
generally, and (y) general principles of equity, regardless of whether
asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law. Neither the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by BBC and Merger Sub, nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the compliance by BBC or Merger
Sub with any of the provisions of this Agreement, will: (i) except as set
forth on Schedule 3.2 hereto, violate, conflict with, or result in a
breach of any of the provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration, or the
creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance upon any of
the properties or assets of BBC or BankAtlantic under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of (a) the Articles or Certificate of Incorporation
or by-laws (or analogous organizational documents) of BBC or BankAtlantic or
(b) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease,
agreement or other instrument or obligation to which BBC or BankAtlantic is a
party or by which BBC or BankAtlantic may be bound, or to which BBC or
BankAtlantic or their respective properties or assets may be subject, or (ii)
violate any judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree (each an
"Order") or statute, rule, regulation, ordinance or directive (each a "Law")
applicable to BBC or BankAtlantic or any of their respective properties or
assets.   3.3 GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS. Other than approvals or waivers from
the Applicable Governmental Authorities listed on Schedule 3.3 hereto, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by BBC and Merger Sub does not, and
the performance by BBC and Merger Sub of their respective obligations
hereunder will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing by BBC with or notification by BBC to, any Applicable
Governmental Authority, except where failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have a Material Adverse Effect as defined in Section
4.1, or prevent or materially delay the performance by BBC or Merger Sub of
its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Neither BBC nor Merger Sub have
any reason to believe that any of the required approvals or waivers from any
of the Applicable Governmental Authorities will not be received or that any
such approval or waiver will contain any condition or requirement deemed
unduly burdensome by BBC or Merger Sub.   3.4 BBC SEC REPORTS. All reports
and other documents filed by BBC with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), including but not limited to proxy statements and reports on
Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K (collectively, the "BBC SEC Reports"), as
of the respective dates they were filed, complied in all material respects
with the rules and regulations of the SEC and did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   3.5 BBC

and BBC\'s unaudited consolidated statement of financial condition and the
related statements of operations, changes in shareholders\' equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows as of and for the six months ended
June 30, 2000 and 2001 (including any notes thereto), (collectively, the "BBC
Financial Statements"), have been prepared in conformity with United States
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP")
(except for changes, if any, required by GAAP and disclosed therein), and the
statements of operations present fairly the results of operations for the
respective periods covered and the statements of condition present fairly the
financial condition of BBC as of their respective dates except for BBC\'s
interim Financial Statements which are subject to normal year-end non-
material adjustments.   3.6 INFORMATION IN PROXY STATEMENT. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by BBC in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy statement (the "Proxy
Statement") relating to the special meeting of Community Bankshares\'
shareholders to be held in connection with the consideration and approval of
this Agreement and the Merger (the "Special Meeting") will, at the dates
mailed to Community Bankshares\' shareholders and at the times of the Special
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. No representation is made by BBC with respect to statements
made therein based on information supplied by Community Bankshares for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement.   3.7 MERGER SUB. Merger Sub has no
material liabilities or other obligations other than those incurred or
entered into in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of
100 shares of Merger Sub Common Stock and all issued and outstanding shares
of Merger Sub Common Stock are owned solely by BBC.   3.8 ABILITY TO PAY
MERGER CONSIDERATION. BBC will have available as of the Effective Time
sufficient cash to pay the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 2.1.

"well-capitalized" institution pursuant to the Home Owners Loan Act ("HOLA")
and the regulations of the OTS.   3.9 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.
There has not been any material adverse change in the business, operations,
prospects, assets or financial condition of BBC since June 30, 2001 and to
the best knowledge of BBC, no fact or condition exists which BBC believes
would in the future have a Material Adverse Effect.   3.10 LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS. Neither BBC nor Merger Sub is a party to any, and there are no
pending, or to the best knowledge of BBC and Merger Sub, threatened legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims, actions
or governmental investigations of any nature against BBC or Merger Sub,
except such proceedings, claims actions or governmental investigations which
in the good faith judgment of BBC and Merger Sub will not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither BBC nor Merger Sub is a party to any order, judgment
or decree which would have a Material Adverse Effect.   3.11 FULL
DISCLOSURE. No representation or warranty of BBC contained in this Agreement,
and none of the statements or information concerning BBC and Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or the exhibits and the schedules
hereto, contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact nor
will such representations, warranties, covenants or statements taken as a
whole omit a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.    ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF COMMUNITY BANKSHARES   Community Bankshares represents and
warrants to BBC and Merger Sub as follows:   4.1 ORGANIZATION, GOOD
STANDING.   (a) Community Bankshares is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Community Bankshares has all necessary corporate power to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to own its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now conducted. Community Bankshares is qualified to conduct
business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
businesses requires such qualification, and each such jurisdiction is set
forth on Schedule 4.1 hereto, except where the failure to be duly qualified
is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter
defined).   (b) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material
Adverse Effect" shall mean (i) in the case of Community Bankshares and its
Subsidiaries, any effect that (A) is material and adverse to the financial
condition, results of operations, assets, business or prospects of Community
Bankshares and its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter defined) considered as one

by, Community Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Loans") represent
bona fide, valid and binding arms\'-length loan transactions with the
borrowers and all of said Loans are repayable upon the dates set forth in the
respective borrower\'s notes and loan agreements. None of the credits entered
or given effect with respect to any Loan was gratuitous or given for a
consideration other than the payment of money to the person to whom payment
was due thereunder. All of the Loans are valid and enforceable in accordance
with their terms, except to the extent that enforcement of the same may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws relating to
or affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and by general
principles of equity and to the knowledge of Community Bankshares no Loan is
subject to any defenses, counterclaims or set offs of any nature. Neither
Community Bankshares nor its Subsidiaries has waived, compromised or
otherwise relinquished any of its rights under any Loan, including, without
limitation, the right of a lender to foreclosure in respect of a secured
Loan. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.20(a), no Loan is made to or with,
directly or indirectly, any Related Party (as defined in Section
4.24 hereof). Neither Community Bankshares nor its Subsidiaries has received
any notice of any offset, defense or counterclaim to, right of refund or
credit (other than any right of refund or credit of unearned finance charges
or unearned premiums) under, or any right of rescission with respect to,
any payment or other obligation under any of the Loans. Schedule 4.20(a)
hereto also contains a complete list of all Loans, if any, where a default
has occurred, or with notice or lapse of time, or both, would render Loans in
default. Other than interest reserves established in the ordinary course of
business at the initial funding of the Loan, except as set forth on Schedule
4.20(a), neither Community Bankshares nor its Subsidiaries has made any
principal or interest payments in respect of any Loans using its own funds.
Each of the Loans was issued in accordance in all material respects with all
applicable statutes and regulatory requirements and have been made in the
ordinary course of business and (except as limited by this Agreement) in
accordance with its customary past practices. Schedule 4.20(a) hereto
contains a true and complete list of all outstanding Loans existing as of the
date hereof setting forth for each such Loan: (a) the name of the lender and
borrower, (b) the loan number, (c) any guarantors, endorsors or co-makers,
(d) the term of the Loan, (e) the original principal amount, (f) the current
outstanding balance, (g) the rate of interest and (h) whether such Loan is
secured and the nature, priority and description (including location) of the
collateral securing such Loan. Documentation maintained by Community
Bankshares and its Subsidiaries in the loan file with respect to each of its
Loans is in accordance with applicable loan policies and all applicable Laws.
Except as indicated on Schedule 4.20(a), there are no Loans in excess of $1
million that are now characterized as owner-occupied residential Loans
which were originated as development or construction Loans to builders or
developers to finance the construction of the residence.   (b) Each
currently outstanding Loan is evidenced by a promissory note duly executed by
the borrower(s). Each Loan designated on Schedule 4.20(a) as secured has in
effect a mortgage, security agreement, or other instrument, duly executed by
the borrower(s) and containing enforceable provisions to protect and assert
a secured party\'s rights and remedies thereunder. For each Loan secured
under a security agreement, such security interest is evidenced by a valid
filing in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code where such a filing is
required, which grants the secured party a perfected security interest in the
collateral described therein; and for each Loan secured by real property, the
related mortgage, deed of trust or other security agreement has been recorded
in the appropriate local land records and constitutes a perfected security
interest in the real property securing such Loan, and the holder of the Loan
has obtained a mortgage title insurance policy insuring such mortgage.  
(c) Schedule 4.20(c) indicates any Loan which was not originated directly by
Community Savings. Except as specifically noted on Schedule
4.20(c), Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries do not hold any indirect
Loans and carry no dealer reserves and are not a party to any "flow purchase"
or other similar obligations that would obligate them to purchase any Loans
(or participations therein) from any third party.   (d) Except as provided
by the standard seller/servicer agreements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
neither Community Bankshares nor any Subsidiary has sold any Loans where the
purchaser or subsequent transferee may have recourse against Community
Bankshares or its Subsidiaries or the right to require Community Bankshares
or its Subsidiaries to repurchase any Loans.   (e) Community Bankshares\'
reserve for possible loan losses is adequate under GAAP and applicable
provisions of the Office of Thrift Supervision to provide for all losses, net
of recoveries relating to loans previously charged off, on outstanding Loans.
Community Bankshares has no knowledge with respect to any borrower\'s
inability to repay any Loan which would require a specific reserve for such
Loan or which would cause the general reserve for loan losses to be
inadequate. Such reserve shall in no event be reduced prior to the Effective
Time unless the failure to reduce such reserve would cause the Community
Financial Statements to violate GAAP.   (f) Except as set forth in Schedule
4.20(f), other than in connection with required flood insurance, neither
Community Bankshares nor any of its Subsidiaries has advanced any amounts to
obtain force-placed collateral protection insurance ("CPI") and they are not
parties to any agreement or arrangement which would require the placement of

Loan participations and any interests in syndicated Loans held by Community
Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries.   4.21 DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS.

course, consistent with past practices, and (ii) there has not been any
event, occurrence, development or set of circumstances or facts which (A) has
had or could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in a Material
Adverse Effect on Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries, or (B) which

Agreement had such events, occurrences, development or set of circumstances
or facts occurred after the date hereof.   4.23 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

its Subsidiaries.   6.2 CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF INFORMATION. The parties
hereto and their representatives shall hold in confidence all data and
information obtained with respect to the other parties or their business, and

AND OTHER VENDOR AGREEMENTS. Community Bankshares shall migrate to the VISION
system as required by that certain Addendum by and between Community Savings
and Fiserv so as to avoid any penalty or liquidated damages upon cancellation

shall, upon the request of BBC made at any time prior to Closing, adjust
Community Bankshares\' accruals and allowance for loan losses in an amount
determined by BBC in accordance with BBC\'s practices, such adjustment to be

however, that Community Bankshares shall not be required to take such action
unless BBC certifies in writing that all conditions to Closing set forth in
Article IX hereof have been satisfied or waived; that no such action will be
required to be taken more than five business days before Closing or if such
action would be inconsistent with GAAP or regulatory accounting principles;
and no accrual or reserve made by Community Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this subsection, or any litigation or regulatory
proceedings arising out of any such accrual or reserve, shall constitute or
be deemed to be a breach or violation of any representation, warranty,
covenant, condition or other provision of this Agreement or to constitute an
event which permits or requires termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article X hereof.   6.6 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.   (a) Except for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Community Bankshares shall not,
directly or indirectly, and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries\' officers,
directors, employees, subsidiaries, agents or advisors or other
representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
encourage, initiate, participate or knowingly facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information) in any negotiations, discussions or inquiries with
respect to any Competing Transaction (as defined below), or continue any such
negotiations or discussions which may have been initiated prior to the date

contemplation of, any Competing Transaction or any potential Competing
Transaction, except as required by Law, disclose any information to any
person concerning the business and properties of Community Bankshares, afford
to any person (other than BBC and its advisors and agents) access to the
properties, books or records of Community Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise assist or encourage any person in connection with
any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.6
shall prohibit the Board of Directors of Community Bankshares from furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person
in connection with an unsolicited bona fide Competing Transaction received
after the date of this Agreement by such person if Community Bankshares\'
Board of Directors determines in good faith: (i) after consulting with its
independent financial advisors, that such person is reasonably likely to be
capable of completing such Competing Transaction, taking into account the
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Competing Transaction,
and the person making such Competing Transaction, and that such Competing
Transaction could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) and (ii) if, and only to the extent that: (a) the Board of
Directors of Community Bankshares, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, believes that such action is required for such Board of Directors to
comply with its duties to its shareholders imposed by Delaware Law and (b)
prior to furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, such person, Community Bankshares obtains from such
person an executed confidentiality and standstill agreement on terms no less
favorable to Community Bankshares, as the case may be, than those contained
in that certain Confidentiality Agreement between Community Bankshares and
BBC dated July 11, 2001, unless the Board of Directors of Community
Bankshares, after consultation with outside legal counsel, believes that such
requirement would violate its duties to its shareholders imposed by Delaware
Law. Community Bankshares shall notify BBC promptly if any proposal or offer,
or any inquiry or contact with any person with respect thereto, regarding a
Competing Transaction is made and provide BBC in reasonable detail the
material terms of any proposal and shall keep BBC promptly advised of the
status of any such proposal. Each party hereto agrees not to release any
third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it is a party.   (b) A "Competing Transaction"
means any of the following involving Community Bankshares, as the case may be
(other than the Merger contemplated by this Agreement): (i) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other similar
transaction involving Community Bankshares or Community Savings, (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of 50 percent or more of
the assets of Community Bankshares or Community Savings, (iii) a Tender Offer
or Exchange Offer (as such terms are defined in Section 12.1(d) hereof) for
20 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of Community
Bankshares, or (iv) any solicitation (made in accordance with Rule 14a-3
under the Exchange Act) in opposition to the approval of the Merger by the
shareholders of Community Bankshares.   (c) A "Superior Proposal" shall mean
any bona fide Competing Transaction which is on terms that the Board of
Directors of Community Bankshares concludes in its good faith judgment (based
upon the written advice of its independent financial advisors), provides for
consideration which would exceed the value of the consideration provided for
in the Merger, after taking into account all relevant factors, including
without limitation, any financing conditions, timing of the closing thereof
and the risk of nonconsummation.   6.7 APPROVAL BY COMMUNITY BANKSHARES\'
SHAREHOLDERS; PROXY STATEMENT.   (a) Community Bankshares shall call the
Special Meeting to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement for the purpose of voting upon the Merger, this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Community Bankshares, through its Board of Directors, shall recommend that
Community Bankshares\' shareholders approve the Merger, this Agreement and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement, shall at BBC\'s request publicly
reaffirm the approval by such Board of Directors and shall not amend, modify,
revoke or withdraw such recommendation; provided, that such Board of
Directors shall not be obligated to make such recommendation if Community
Bankshares shall have received an unsolicited Superior Proposal and such
Board of Directors determines, in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and legal counsel, that the making of such
recommendation would violate the Board of Directors\' duties to its
shareholders under Delaware Law; provided, further, that in no event may the
Board of Directors take such action earlier than the conclusion of the second
business day following BBC\'s receipt of written notice of the intention of
the Board of Directors to do so. Community Bankshares shall use its best
efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and the Merger pursuant to the Proxy Statement, and shall take
all other action necessary or advisable to obtain the vote or consent of
shareholders required by the DGCL to obtain such approval, except to the
extent that the Board of Directors of Community Bankshares has received an
unsolicited Superior Proposal and determines in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel that the withdrawal, modification or change of its
recommendation is necessary in order to avoid violating its fiduciary duties
to Community Bankshares\' shareholders under Delaware Law. Community
Bankshares may, and, if requested by BBC, shall, retain a proxy solicitor
reasonably acceptable to BBC in connection with the Special Meeting.   (b)
Community Bankshares shall prepare the Proxy Statement and any amendments or
supplements thereto and Community Bankshares shall file the Proxy Statement
and any such amendments or supplements with the SEC; provided, however, that
Community Bankshares shall not file the Proxy Statement or any such amendment
or supplement with the SEC without the prior consent of BBC, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Community Bankshares will advise BBC,
prior to distributing the Proxy Statement to its shareholders, of the time
when Community Bankshares intends to distribute the Proxy Statement, and
Community Bankshares shall not distribute the Proxy Statement without
the prior consent of BBC, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Community Bankshares shall promptly notify BBC of the issuance of
any Order suspending the use of the Proxy Statement, of the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Proxy Statement for additional
information.   6.8 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS BY THIRD PARTIES. Community
Bankshares shall use its best efforts to obtain as soon as practicable all
consents and approvals of any third parties necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.   (a) Full-time employees of Community

employees on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis in accordance with and
subject to the terms and provisions of such benefit plans, with credit for
years of service with Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of determining eligibility for participation, vesting and entitlement
to vacation time and sick pay (but not for the purpose of accrual or
restoration of benefits under any existing or future benefit plan of BBC or
any of its Subsidiaries where benefits are calculated on an actuarial basis,
including any qualified or non-qualified defined benefit plan or restoration
plan). Contributions to (and accrual of benefits, to the extent applicable,

plan of BBC or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. BBC shall
amend its qualified plans to the extent necessary to accomplish
the foregoing, provided that such amendments are consistent with the Code and
any other applicable Law. BBC shall use its best efforts to cause any and
all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did
not apply to a pre-existing condition under the corresponding Community
Savings group health plan) and eligibility waiting periods under its group
health plans to be waived with respect to such participants and their
eligible dependents.   (b) GENERAL SEVERANCE. If the employment of any full-
time employee of Community Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries is
involuntarily terminated other than for Cause (as hereinafter defined) within
six months following the Effective Time, BBC or its applicable Subsidiary
shall provide severance benefits to such employee in a lump sum cash amount
equal to the sum of (i) such employee\'s regular salary for a one-week period
(as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) multiplied by the
total number of whole years of such employee\'s full-time employment at
Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries (subject to a minimum severance of
two weeks for those employees who have at least one year of service as of the
Effective Time and a maximum severance of 26 weeks), and (ii) the employee\'s
accrued but unused vacation and personal emergency days, plus the
continuation of any insurance benefits that the terminated employee was
receiving through the end of the calendar month in which the employee
receives his or her lump sum severance payment, provided, however, such
period of continued coverage shall be no less than fifteen
days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no event shall BBC or any of
its Subsidiaries have any obligation to provide severance benefits pursuant
to this Section 7.4(b) to any full-time employee (i) whose termination of
employment occurs due to resignation or discharge for Cause or (ii) who is
entitled to severance benefits or the equivalent thereof under the terms of
any employment or change in control severance agreement with Community
Bankshares or its Subsidiaries. "Cause" shall mean termination because of the
employee\'s (a) conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a
felony or a crime of falsehood or moral turpitude, (b) willful misconduct or
gross negligence, (c) breach of fiduciary duty, (d) failure to perform stated
duties if such failure is not cured following written notice to the employee,
or (e) willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than traffic
violations or similar offenses) or final cease and desist order.   (c)
EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS. BBC shall honor all
existing employment and change in control severance agreements
(the "Severance Agreements") of Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries
that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each of which is
disclosed on Schedule 7.4(c), which schedule describes in reasonable detail
the amount of payments and benefits which could become due and payable to
each such person under the agreements as a result of a termination of
employment and/or a change in control of Community Bankshares. The cash
severance and other fringe benefits provided for by such employment and
change in control severance agreements shall be paid or provided to the
respective officers over the time period following the Effective Time
specified in the agreements (or in a lump sum at the officer\'s election)
regardless of whether or not the officer is subsequently hired by BBC or any
of its Subsidiaries, with the insurance coverages to be provided to
the respective individual pursuant to their agreements. Community
Bankshares represents and warrants that the amounts reflected in Schedule
7.4(c) (A) have been calculated in a manner consistent with, and according
to, the provisions of the Agreements (copies of which have been furnished by
Community Bankshares to BBC), and (B) represent good faith estimates of the
amounts payable as of the future date specified therein based upon
assumptions regarding interest rates, compensation or the assumed date of
Closing, which are disclosed in Schedule 7.4(c), and (ii) the amounts payable
under such Severance Agreements are good faith estimates subject to change
due to changes in interest rates, compensation or the assumed date of
Closing. Provided that the methodologies used are in accordance with the
requirements of the Severance Agreements, BBC acknowledges that substantially
the same methodologies will be used to calculate the amounts payable under
the Severance Agreements at Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
present value of the cash severance, fringe benefits and other parachute
amounts (including any parachute amounts associated with the accelerated
vesting of stock options and restricted stock awards) shall not exceed the
respective officer\'s limit under Section 280G of the Code. The employees of
Community Bankshares and its subsidiaries who have Severance Agreements shall
also be entitled to receive their accrued but unused vacation and personal
emergency days as of the Effective Time.   (d) ESOP. Community Bankshares
shall take all necessary action to cause the Community Bankshares ESOP to be
terminated as of the Effective Time. Community Bankshares will adopt
amendments to the ESOP, to the extent necessary, that provide (i) the Merger
Consideration received by the Community Bankshares ESOP trustee in connection
with the Merger with respect to the unallocated shares of Community
Bankshares Common Stock shall be first applied by the Community Bankshares
ESOP trustee to the full repayment of the Community Bankshares ESOP loan,
(ii) the balance of the Merger Consideration (if any) received by
the Community Bankshares ESOP trustee with respect to the unallocated shares
of Community Bankshares Common Stock shall be allocated as earnings to the
accounts of all participants in the Community Bankshares ESOP who have
accounts remaining under the Community Bankshares ESOP (whether or not such
participants are then actively employed) and beneficiaries in proportion to
the account balances of such participants and beneficiaries as of the first
day of the Community Bankshares ESOP plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs, (iii) the accounts of all participants and beneficiaries in the
Community Bankshares ESOP immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become fully vested as of the Effective Time, and (iv) as may be requested by
the IRS in connection with the request for a determination letter as
described below. BBC agrees that for a period of two years following the
Effective Time, BBC will provide to members of the administrative committee
on the date hereof quarterly reports regarding the status and the
administration of the ESOP.   The Merger Consideration received by the
Community Bankshares ESOP Trustee shall be applied as provided for in the
ESOP and as may be required by law. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, Community Bankshares shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
documents with the IRS, including the amendments described above, for a
determination letter for termination of the Community Bankshares ESOP as of
the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the later of the Effective
Time or the receipt of a favorable determination letter for termination from
the IRS, the account balances in the Community Bankshares ESOP shall be
distributed to participants and beneficiaries in accordance with applicable
law and the ESOP. Prior to the Effective Time, no prepayments shall be made
on the Community Bankshares ESOP loan and contributions to the
Community Bankshares ESOP and payments on the Community Bankshares ESOP loan
shall be made consistent with past practices on the regularly scheduled
payment dates. The termination of the ESOP shall not subject Community
Bankshares or BBC to any obligation or liability.   (e) 401 (k) PLAN.
Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries shall take all necessary action to
cause the Community Bankshares 401(k) Plan to be terminated as of the
Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Community
Bankshares shall file or cause to be filed all necessary documents with the
IRS for a determination letter for termination of the Community Bankshares
401(k) Plan as of the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after receipt of
the favorable determination letter for termination from the IRS, the account
balances in the 401(k) Plan shall be distributed to participants
and beneficiaries in accordance with applicable law and the 401(k) Plan
documents. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Community
Bankshares and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to make employer profit
sharing contributions and 401(k) matching contributions to the Community
Bankshares 401(k) Plan on a periodic monthly basis, consistent with past
practices. The termination of the 401(k) shall not subject Community
Bankshares or BBC to any obligation or liability. BBC agrees that for a
period of two years following the Effective Time, BBC will provide to members
of the administrative committee on the date hereof quarterly reports
regarding the status and the administration of the 401(k) Plan.   (f) SERP.
BBC and its Subsidiaries agree to honor Community Bankshares\' Amended and
Restated Supplemental Retirement Income Plan (the "SERP") and to timely make
the payments to each of the SERP participants set forth on
Community Bankshares Disclosure Schedule 7.4(f). Schedule 7.4(f) details all
amounts payable pursuant to the SERP. BBC and its Subsidiaries and their
respective successors and assigns agree not to make any changes to the SERP
that would adversely affect the SERP participants in any manner, provided
that no additional benefits will accrue under the SERP after the Effective
Time and provided that nothing herein shall limit BBC\'s right to terminate
the SERP after payment to the participants pursuant to its terms. Except as
indicated on Schedule 7.4(f), amounts payable under the SERP are accrued on
the Community Financial Statements to the extent required by GAAP.   (g)
CONSULTING AGREEMENT. Effective as of the Effective Time, BBC agrees that
either it and/or BankAtlantic Bank will enter into a one-year
consulting agreement with James B. Pittard, Jr. providing for (i) an annual
consulting fee of $300,000 payable in equal monthly installments, (ii)
medical and dental benefits for Mr. Pittard and his eligible dependents for
the term of the agreement to the same extent and at the same cost provided to
BBC executive officers, and (iii) the use of an office and of the automobile
owned by Community Savings, with the form of the consulting agreement to be
substantially in the form attached as Schedule 7.4(g).   (h) RETENTION
BONUSES. Following execution of this Agreement in order to insure an orderly
Closing and transition period, Community Bankshares and BBC shall identify
individual employees of Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries who will be
entitled to receive a "retention" bonus in the event that such employee
remains an employee and satisfactorily fulfills the duties
and responsibilities of his or her position through a designated date
subsequent to the Effective Time.   (j) ENFORCEABILITY. The obligations of
BBC under this Section 7.4 are intended to be enforceable against BBC
directly by the persons identified in such paragraphs and shall be binding on
any successors and permitted assigns of BBC.   7.5 INDEMNIFICATION.   (a)
After the Effective Time, BankAtlantic shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any time before the
date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or director
of Community Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified
Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
attorney\'s fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of BBC,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, or administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party
is, or is threatened to be made, a party based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of Community Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries if
such Claim pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring
before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger)
regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or at
or after, the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable state law or the OTS regulations, whichever
is applicable, in effect as of the date hereof or as amended applicable to a
time before the Effective Time and under the Certificate of Incorporation,
Charter or by-laws or Board of Directors\' resolutions of Community
Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries, whichever is applicable, as in effect
on the date hereof. BBC shall pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in effect on the date hereof or as
amended applicable to a time before the Effective Time upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable Law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 7.5(a), upon learning of any Claim,
shall notify BBC (but the failure so to notify BBC shall not relieve it from
any liability which it may have under this Section 7.5(a) except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices BBC) and shall deliver to BBC any
undertaking required by applicable Law. BBC shall ensure, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, whichever is applicable, that all limitations
of liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, Charter or by-laws of Community Bankshares or
any of its Subsidiaries(as the case may be), as in effect on the date hereof,
or allowed under applicable Law as in effect on the date hereof or as such
law or regulation may be amended applicable to a time before the Effective
Time, with respect to Indemnified Liabilities shall survive the consummation
of the Transactions.   (b) For a period of six years from and after the
Effective Time, BBC shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by
Community Bankshares and its Subsidiaries (provided that BBC may substitute
therefor policies from a financially capable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amount containing terms and conditions which are substantially
no less advantageous, or in the event such coverage is provided through
BBC\'s insurer it may be on terms and conditions (other than coverage and
amounts) consistent with BBC\'s current coverage), or in lieu thereof obtain
single limit tail coverage for such period (which shall be purchased by
Community Bankshares immediately prior to Closing upon the request of BBC),
with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time.   (c) The obligations of BBC provided under paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 7.5 are intended to be enforceable against BBC
directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors
and permitted assigns of BBC.   7.6 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to the
terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable on the
part of such party, to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date, including
obtaining all required consents, approvals, waivers, exemptions, amendments
and authorizations, giving all notices, and making or effecting all filings,
registrations, applications, designations and declarations, including, but
not limited to, those described in the schedules to this Agreement, and each
party shall cooperate fully with the other (including by providing any
necessary information) with respect to the foregoing. In case at any time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper officers and/or directors of BBC or Community
Bankshares will take all such necessary action. The parties agree
and acknowledge that it may be necessary to restructure the
transactions contemplated herein to address regulatory concerns or the
concerns of tax counsel. The parties agree to use their best efforts to
address any such concerns and to restructure the transactions as reasonably
necessary to address such concerns provided, however that (i) the Merger
Consideration is not thereby changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result
of such restructuring and (ii) such modification will not materially delay or
jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of Applicable Governmental
Authorities.   7.7 TAX TREATMENT. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
to treat the Merger for federal and state income Tax purposes as a taxable
acquisition of the Community Bankshares Common Stock by BBC. None of the
parties hereto shall take any position on any Return or otherwise
inconsistent therewith.    ARTICLE VIII  CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO
OBLIGATIONS OF BBC   The obligations of BBC to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be subject to the fulfillment at or prior to the

warranties qualified by materiality which shall continue to be true and
correct in all respects) as though made at and as of the Effective Time
except for (i)representations and warranties relating to a time or
times other than the Effective Time that were or will be true, correct and
complete at such other time or times and (ii) where the failure or failures
of such representations and warranties to be so true, correct, and
complete, individually or in the aggregate, without giving effect to any
materiality qualifications or references to materiality therein, does not
result or could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Community Bankshares;   (b) Community Bankshares shall have in
all material respects performed and satisfied or otherwise complied with, or
caused such performance and satisfaction of and compliance with, all
covenants, terms and conditions required by this Agreement to be performed

shareholders of Community Bankshares or such Subsidiary, as applicable, and
BBC and BankAtlantic shall have received certified copies of the resolutions
evidencing such authorizations.   8.3 CONSENTS, WAIVERS. All consents,
approvals, waivers, exemptions, amendments and authorizations required to be
obtained prior to the Effective Time shall have been obtained at or prior to
the Effective Time, and all filings, registrations, applications,
designations and declarations required prior to the Effective Time shall have
been made or effected at or prior to the Effective Time, and BBC shall have
obtained the consents and approvals of the third parties set forth on
Schedule 8.3 hereto, none of which shall contain or be subject to any
conditions which BBC in its reasonable opinion deems unduly burdensome or
which would materially reduce the value of the Merger to BBC.   8.4
REGULATORY APPROVAL. All approvals, waivers and authorizations of, filings
and registrations with, and notifications to, all Applicable Governmental
Authorities required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by

approvals or authorizations shall contain or be subject to any terms
or conditions (other than those generally imposed in similar transactions)

makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Merger because any such suit, action
or proceeding has a significant potential to be resolved in such a way as to
deprive it of any of the material benefits to it of the Merger.   8.7
DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS. Holders of not more than 15% of the outstanding shares
of Community Bankshares Common Stock shall have exercised, or shall remain

deprive it of any of the material benefits to it of the Merger.   9.6 NO
ACTION TO PREVENT OR RESTRICT MERGER. No Law or Order shall have been

(iv) the Board of Directors of Community Bankshares fails to reaffirm
publicly and unconditionally its recommendation to its shareholders of the
Merger, which reaffirmation must be made within three business days
after BBC\'s written request to do so;   (h) by Community Bankshares, if

the transactions contemplated hereby do not occur as a result of
circumstances described below, Community Bankshares agrees to pay BBC, and
BBC shall be entitled to payment of, a fee (the "Fee") of $6.0 million (less
any amounts paid pursuant to the provisions of Section 12.1(f) hereof) upon

such damages and costs would be impracticable or extremely difficult to
determine, and that the sum of $6.0 million constitutes a reasonable estimate
by the parties under the circumstances existing as of the date of this
Agreement of such damages and costs. Such payment shall be made to BBC by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by BBC
within five business days after the occurrence of a Termination Event. A Fee

accordance with its terms following the occurrence of a Preliminary
Termination Event (as defined herein), (iii) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof prior to the occurrence of a Termination
Event or a Preliminary Termination Event (other than a termination of this
Agreement by BBC pursuant to Section 10.1(c) hereof), or (iv) 12 months after
the termination of this Agreement by BBC pursuant to Section 10.1(c) hereof
as a result of a willful or intentional breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement by Community Bankshares.   (c) For purposes
of this Agreement, a "Termination Event" shall mean any of the following
events:   (i) (A) Community Bankshares, without having received BBC\'s
prior  written consent, shall have entered into an agreement to engage in a 
Competing Transaction with any person (the term "person" for purposes of 
this Agreement shall mean a natural person or any legal, commercial or 
governmental entity, such as, but not limited to, a corporation, general or 
limited partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, 
business association, group acting in concert, or any person acting in a 
representative capacity) other than BBC or any subsidiary of BBC, or the 
Board of Directors of Community Bankshares shall have approved or 
recommended that the shareholders of Community Bankshares approve or accept 
any Competing Transaction with any person other than BBC or any subsidiary 
of BBC or a Competing Transaction described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii)  of
Section 6.6(b) shall have been consummated; or   (ii) any person, other than
BBC, shall have acquired beneficial  ownership (as such term is defined in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the  Exchange Act) of or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, or any  "group" (as such term is defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)  shall have been formed which beneficially owns
or has the right to acquire  beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the
aggregate voting power  represented by the outstanding Community Bankshares
Common Stock.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Preliminary

the Securities Act of 1933, as amended  ("Securities Act"), with respect to,
a tender offer or exchange offer to  purchase any shares of Community
Bankshares Common Stock such that, upon  consummation of such offer, such
person would own or control 20% or more of  Community Bankshares Common Stock
outstanding (such an offer being referred  to herein as a "Tender Offer" and
an "Exchange Offer," respectively,  regardless of whether the provisions of
Regulations 14D or 14E under the  Exchange Act apply to such Tender Offer or

this Agreement is terminated as a consequence of the fact that BBC failed for

provided, however, that BBC shall not be required to reimburse Community
Bankshares for such expenses if at the time of such termination Community
Bankshares had materially breached its representations, warranties

authorizations resulted as a consequence of facts or circumstances relating
to Community Bankshares or its Subsidiaries.   (h) Any amounts required to

receive such amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by such party.   (i) In the event that a party shall fail
