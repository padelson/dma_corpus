by (x) __ any applicable rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof or (y) the rules and regulations of NASDAQ or

in accordance with this Section 2.01(c)) is referred to herein as the
"Expiration Time." Merger Subsidiary shall not, and Parent shall cause it not

Time of the Offer unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with its terms. In the event that this Agreement is terminated, Merger
Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause it to, promptly, irrevocably and

Expiration Time, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer (the time at which Shares are first accepted for payment under the
Offer, the "Acceptance Time", and the date on which the Acceptance Time
occurs, the "Offer Closing Date"), and (ii) promptly thereafter pay for such
Shares.

 



11 (e) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent

shall have become known to be) false or misleading in any material
respect. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws
or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. The Company shall furnish to Parent

the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall be
governed by Section 251(h) of Delaware Law and shall be effected as soon as

of the Offer without a vote on the adoption of this Agreement by the

"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 as soon as

conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than conditions that by their

to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place or time as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

 



14 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file
a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all
other Filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time")
as such certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State (or at such later time as may be specified in such certificate of
merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with
Section 3.03, without interest.

 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
(other than the Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving
Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation (except for any such shares resulting from the conversion of
Shares pursuant to Section 3.02(c)).

 

Section 3.03. _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint (pursuant to an
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) the Companys
transfer agent or another agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) certificates representing Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii)
uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (the "Uncertificated Shares").
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in

the amount deposited shall be insufficient to make the payments of the Merger
Consideration contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall, or shall cause
one of its Affiliates

 



15  to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount
sufficient to make such payments). Promptly after the Effective Time, and in
any event not later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of Shares
at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) __ receipt of an "agents message"
by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share
represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Shares.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) __ the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 3.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares 12 months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or one of its Affiliates, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section __ 3.03 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration
in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



16 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Shares for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent or one of its
Affiliates upon demand.

 

Section 3.04. _Dissenting Shares_ _._ Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has (a) not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and
(b) who has properly demanded appraisal for its Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of Delaware Law and who has otherwise complied with all
applicable provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law (such shares, "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by
Section 262 of Delaware Law, unless such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under Section 262
of Delaware Law. If, either before or after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262
of Delaware Law, such Dissenting Shares shall automatically be converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.02(a). The Company shall give Parent prompt written
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Dissenting
Shares and any withdrawals of any such demands and Parent shall have
the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not take any action with respect to such demands (including making any payment
with respect to, or offering to settle or settling, any such demands).

Section 3.05. _Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each vested Company Stock Option, whether or not
exercisable, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an
amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option _multiplied
by_ (ii) __ the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option
(it being understood that, each unexercised Company Stock Option with an
exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
canceled at the Effective Time without consideration therefor).

(b) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company Stock Option shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) __
the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option (the "Unvested
Option Consideration");  _provided_ , that such per share Unvested Option
Consideration shall not be paid at the Effective Time but shall instead be
subject to the holder remaining continuously employed with the Merger
Subsidiary (or an affiliate thereof) and satisfaction of the original vesting
conditions applicable to the underlying unvested Company Stock Option in
accordance with its terms. On the first regular payroll date following the
month

 



17  in which the vesting conditions underlying any Unvested Option Consideration
are satisfied, Parent shall cause the Merger Subsidiary (or an affiliate
thereof) to pay the per share Unvested Option Consideration (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) to such holders who had satisfied the applicable
vesting conditions as of the applicable vesting date.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each vested Company RSU shall be canceled, and
the Company shall, to the extent permissible under Section 409A of the Code,
pay the holder of any such award at or promptly after the Effective Time an
amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number
of Shares represented by such award.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company RSU shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive an amount (subject to applicable
withholding Tax) in cash, without interest, equal to the product of the Merger
Consideration and the number of Shares represented by such award (the
"Unvested RSU Consideration"); _provided_ , that such per share Unvested RSU
Consideration shall not be paid at the Effective Time but shall instead be
subject to the holder remaining continuously employed with the Merger
Subsidiary and satisfaction of the original vesting conditions applicable
to the underlying unvested Company RSU in accordance with its terms. On the
first regular payroll date following the month in which the vesting conditions
underlying any Unvested RSU Consideration are satisfied, Parent shall cause
the Merger Subsidiary to pay the per share Unvested RSU Consideration
(subject to any applicable withholding Tax) to such holders who had satisfied
the applicable vesting conditions as of the applicable vesting date (even if
the holders employment or service terminates prior to payment).

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions as
are reasonably necessary to (i) effectuate the treatment of Company Stock
Options and Company RSUs set forth in this Section __ 3.05, including
obtaining consents from award holders and making any amendments to the terms
of the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement governing such
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, in accordance with Applicable Law and
the terms of such applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement and (ii)
__ terminate, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
applicable Company Stock Plan.

Section 3.06. _Company ESPP_. Prior to the Offer Closing Date, the
Company shall take all actions necessary or required under the Company ESPP
and Applicable Law to ensure that no offering shall be authorized, continued
or commenced following the date hereof. The Company shall terminate the
Company ESPP effective as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Offer Closing
Date, the Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending
the terms of the Company ESPP) that are necessary or appropriate to effect
the foregoing.

Section 3.07. _Adjustments_ _._ If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing, the outstanding Shares (or securities
convertible or exchangeable into, or exercisable for, Shares) shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or
stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period or otherwise, but
excluding any change that results from any issuance of Shares permitted by
Section 7.01(c)), the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and

 



18  any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately
and proportionately adjusted, and such adjustment to the Offer Price and
Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. Nothing in this
Section 3.07 shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 3.08. _Withholding Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding any
provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent,
Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax
law. If the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts and remits such amounts to
the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 3.09. _Lost Certificates_ _. _ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 3.

expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) __ may furnish to such Third
Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (a copy of
which shall be provided for informational purposes only to Parent) with such
Third Party with terms in all material respects no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in Section __ 6.02 of the Investor Rights
Agreement and other terms necessary to permit the Company to comply with its
obligations to Parent pursuant to this Section 7.03; _provided_ that all
such information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent,
as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided or made available to such Third Party;

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 7.03(d), if the Company has
received a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board (or the Special
Committee) may make an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section __
11.01(d)(iv) in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such
Superior Proposal on the terms disclosed to Parent pursuant to Section __
7.03(d);

 



45 (iii) subject to compliance with Section __ 7.03(d), the Company Board
(or the Special Committee) may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a material event, change or development in circumstances arising
after the date hereof that was neither known by nor reasonably foreseeable to
the Company Board as of or prior to the date hereof and does not involve or
relate to an Acquisition Proposal (an "Intervening Event");

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), only
if the Company Board (or the Special Committee) determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, provided
that the Company has complied with Section 7.03(a), the Company and its
Representatives may (x) following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal from
a Third Party, contact such Third Party solely to clarify the terms and
conditions of an Acquisition Proposal made by such Third Party so as to
determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal or (y) direct any such Third Party
to this Agreement, including the specific provisions of this Section 7.03(a).

 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board (or the
Special Committee) from complying with Rule 14d-9 (including Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act) or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that (i) any such action
taken or statement made shall be subject to and only taken in compliance with
this and (ii) any such action taken or statement made that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
statement or in connection with such action; _provided_ , _further_ , that it
is understood and agreed that any factually accurate public statement by the
Company that merely describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains a "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(c) _Required Notices_. None of the Company Board (or the Special
Committee), the Company, any Subsidiaries of the Company or any of their
respective Representatives shall take any of the actions referred to in
Section 7.03(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action,
and, after taking any such action, the Company shall continue to advise
Parent on a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any indication that a Third Party is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that has made, is seeking to make or would reasonably be expected to make
an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in
writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition

 



46  Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and material terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and shall promptly (but
in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that describes any material terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any material oral
communications addressing such matters). Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the Companys compliance with this Section __ 7.03(c).

(d) " _Last Look_." Further, the Company Board (or the Special Committee)
shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 7.03(b),
unless: (i) __ the Company promptly provides written notice to Parent at
least four Business Days before taking such action of its intention to do so
(such four Business Day period, the "Negotiation Period"), (ii) __ (A) in the
case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a
Superior Proposal, such notice specifies in reasonable detail the basis for
the Adverse Recommendation Change and attaches the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal
or (B) __ in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made in
response to an Intervening Event pursuant to Section __ 7.03(b)(ii), such
notice includes a reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts
giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such Adverse Recommendation Change
and during the Negotiation Period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate,
the Company negotiates, and causes its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent or and its Representatives with respect to any
proposed changes by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (or with respect to other proposals made
by Parent) and (iii) __ Parent does not make, prior to 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on the final day of the Negotiation Period, an offer that (A) __
in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt
of a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section __ 7.03(b), is at least as
favorable to the stockholders of the Company (other than Roche Holding Ltd and
its Affiliates) as such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company
and a new three-Business Day period under this Section __ 7.03(d), which
shall also be deemed to be a "Negotiation Period" under this Section __
7.03(d)) or (B) __ in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made
in response to an Intervening Event pursuant to Section __ 7.03(b)(i),
eliminates the basis for such Adverse Recommendation Change under Section __
7.03(b).

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares or a majority of
the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms that the
Special Committee determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering the advice of an outside financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all
the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to
the Companys stockholders (other than Roche Holding Ltd and its Affiliates)
than as provided hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03(d), which the
Special Committee determines is reasonably likely to be consummated and for
which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then
fully committed by reputable financing sources or reasonably determined to be
available by the Special Committee.

 



47 (f) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
and its Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (together with
its Representatives) that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, within the 24-month period prior to
the date hereof, and that is in possession of confidential information
heretofore furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in connection with the consideration of an Acquisition Proposal (and all
analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that
contain, reflect or analyze that information) to return or destroy all such
information as promptly as practicable. The Company represents and warrants
to Parent that, during the 24-month period prior to the date hereof, neither
it nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 7.04. _Section 16 Matters_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such
shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section __ 7.05. _Stock Exchange Delisting;_ _Exchange_ _Act
Deregistration_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under Applicable Law and rules and policies
of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares
from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

Section __ 7.06. _Compensation Arrangements_ _._ Prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all
steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause each Compensation
Arrangement that has not previously been subject to the Compensation
Arrangement Approvals described in Section 5.18(i) to be approved by the
Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors" determined
in the manner described in the last sentence of Section 5.18(i)) as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
of the Exchange Act.

Section __ 7.07. _Takeover Statutes_ _._ The Company shall: (a) take all
actions necessary so that no "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"moratorium" or other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the transactions contemplated or permitted by this

 



48  Agreement and (b) __ if any such antitakeover or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated or permitted by
this Agreement, to take all actions necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable and otherwise to take all such other
actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize to the greatest
extent possible the effects of any such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

Section __ 7.08. _Stockholder Litigation_ _._ From and after the date
hereof, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Proceedings (including derivative claims) commenced or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and/or the other

transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably
informed regarding any such Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such Proceeding
and shall give due consideration to Parents views with respect thereto. The
Company shall not agree to any settlement of any such Proceeding without
Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

ARTICLE 8

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Section 8.01. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_ _._ Parent shall take all
actions necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement. As a material inducement to the
Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Merger Subsidiary of each of the covenants,
obligations and undertakings required to be performed by Merger Subsidiary
under this Agreement, subject to all terms, conditions and limitations
contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents, acknowledges and agrees
that the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to
pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising out of any such
breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary in the first instance. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall
take any action (or fail to take any action) that would result in the Merger
not being permitted to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of Delaware Law.

 

Section 8.02. _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to exculpate,
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, managers and
directors of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified
Person") against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable and documented
fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable and documented attorneys fees
and disbursements, incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, assessment, audit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or pertaining to or by reason of the fact that an
Indemnified Person is or was an officer, manager or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, while serving as an officer, manager or director
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a

 



49  director, manager, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-
profit entity, in each case, including such matters that exist or occur prior
to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time (each, an "Indemnified Proceeding"). In the event of any Indemnified
Proceeding, (1) each Indemnified Person will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of such Indemnified Proceeding from the
Surviving Corporation; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, (2) __
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any Indemnified Proceeding in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Indemnified
Proceeding or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents thereto in writing,
and (3) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such
matter to the fullest extent provided by Applicable Law and under the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date
hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any actual
or threatened Proceeding (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time) requiring indemnification or advancement under this
Section 8.02 is instituted against any Indemnified Person on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
8.02 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees
and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i)
continue to maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time the
Companys directors and officers insurance policies and fiduciary liability
insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date
hereof or (ii) purchase a "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both
amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, for such six-year
period, in each case with respect to any claim related to any period of time
at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in the
Companys DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof; _provided_
 that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in
excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full
fiscal year; and  _provided further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. In lieu of the Surviving Corporations maintaining such
current policies (or providing substitute policies) or purchasing a "tail
policy," the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a

 



50  six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and
scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time, covering, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that the Company
shall not expend more than 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid for
the current DandO Insurance for the premium of such tail coverage; and
_provided further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such tail coverage
exceed such amount, the Company is only permitted to obtain tail coverage with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. If such
tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and
effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored
by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.02.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.02 shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. It is expressly agreed by
the parties that each Indemnified Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of
this Section 8.02 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained
herein.

Section 8.03. _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide each employee of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing
Employees") who are employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries during such
period with compensation and benefits (other than equity based compensation,
defined benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits) that are
comparable in the aggregate to such compensation and benefits as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent will, subject to Applicable Law,
give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) waiting periods to participate and
vesting under any employee benefit plans (other than defined benefit pension
plans and equity or other long-term incentive plans) and (ii) determination of
benefit levels relating solely to vacation, sick, personal time off or
severance plans and policies, in each case for which the Continuing
Employee is otherwise eligible and in

 



51  which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, except if such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent
such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company or
its Subsidiaries applicable to such Continuing Employee prior to the
Effective Time and (B) recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out-
of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i)
each existing employment, change in control, retention, severance and
termination protection plan (including the severance policy set forth on
Section 8.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or agreement of or
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any current or former
officer, director or employee of that company, (ii) all obligations in effect
as of the Effective Time under any equity-based, bonus or compensation
deferral plans, programs or agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
(iii) all vested and accrued benefits under any Company Employee Plan.

 

(d) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are
necessary to cause the Company Stock Plans to terminate effective as of no
later than immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, if directed
in writing by Parent at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all actions that are necessary to cause any Company
Employee Plan intended to qualify as a cash or deferred arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Code to terminate effective as of no later
than immediately prior to the Effective Time. All resolutions, notices or
other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the
implementation of this Section 8.03(c) shall be subject to Parents prior
review and approval. The Company shall promptly provide all information about
the Continuing Employees participation in the Company Employee Plans
(including regarding elections) that Parent reasonably requests to permit
Parent to meet its obligations pursuant to this Section 8.03(c).

(e) Through the Closing, Parent and the Company agree to work together in
good faith to consult with, or obtain the consent or advice of, any labor or
trade union, works council or other employee representative body as required
or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
to the extent applicable.

 

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to continue
to employ any Continuing Employee for any period of time following the
Effective Time, (i) Parent or its Affiliates may revise, amend or terminate
any Company Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or
policy in effect from time to time, (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as an amendment of any Company Employee Plan and (iii) no provision
of this Section 8.03 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Company Service Provider or former Company Service Provider (including any
beneficiary or dependent of such Company Service Provider or former Company
Service Provider) in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment)
or any other matter.

receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 p.m. on a business
day in the place of receipt. Otherwise, any such notice, request or
communication shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
business day in the place of receipt.

 

Section 12.02. _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_ _._ The
representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Acceptance Time.

 

Section 12.03. _Amendments and Waivers_.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by
each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ that (i) any
such amendment or waiver by the Company shall be at the direction of and
approved by the Special Committee, (ii) after the Acceptance Time no amendment
shall be made that decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration and
(iii) there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the approval
of the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law without such approval
having first been obtained.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 12.04. _Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense.

(b) _Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated by (A) Parent
pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(i) or (B) by the Company pursuant to Section
11.01(d)(iv), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds $34.5 million (the "Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by
Parent, within one Business Day after such termination and in the case of a
termination by the Company, immediately before and as a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination.

 

(c) _Other Costs and Expenses_. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay any amount due to Parent pursuant to
this Section 12.04, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by
Parent and its Affiliates in connection with a legal action to enforce this
Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount,
together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at
the higher of the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. and the
maximum legal interest rate then-applicable pursuant to Title 6, Chapter 23, §
2301 of the Delaware Code, 

 



59  in either case from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to be
paid to (but excluding) the payment date. In the event that Parent shall
receive full payment pursuant to this Section 12.04, without limiting
Parents rights in the case of fraud or intentional misconduct, the receipt of
the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
damages or losses suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the termination hereof (or any matter
forming the basis for such termination), and neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to bring any Proceeding against the Company
or any of its Affiliates for damages or any equitable relief arising
therefrom. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Company
pursuant to this Section 12.04 shall be payable only once and not in
duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions of Section 12.04.

Section 12.05. _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in
the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other
representations and warranties of the Company that are contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties would
be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference and
such representations and warranties without any independent knowledge on the
part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of
any Company SEC Document described in the first sentence of Article 5 shall
only be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the
representations and warranties of the Company if the relevance of that
information as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
such representations and warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable
person who has read that information concurrently with such representations
and warranties, together with the Company Disclosure Schedule, without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed; in each case, excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk
factors" section, any disclosures in any "forward-looking statements" section
and any other disclosures to the extent they are cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature, and excluding any information incorporated by
reference or exhibits attached to any of the foregoing.

 

Section 12.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except for the right of holders of Shares to receive the Offer
Consideration as set forth in Article 2 (which, from and after the Acceptance
Time, shall be for the benefit of Persons who have tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) Shares pursuant to the Offer), the right of holders of Shares to
receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in Article 3 (which, from and
after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of Persons who are holders
of Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time) and Section 8.02, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



60 (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other
party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after
the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders
to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer or the rights of holders of Shares to receive the
Merger Consideration.

Section 12.07. _Governing Law_ _._ This Agreement and all claims and
causes of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

Section 12.08. _Jurisdiction_ _._ The parties hereto agree that any
Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware
Court of Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
12.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

Section 12.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF. 

Section 12.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_ _._ This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

 



61 Section 12.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Annexes and
Exhibits attached hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Investor
Rights Agreement (it being understood that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall constitute a waiver of any partys rights under the Investor Rights
Agreement or the Credit Agreement) constitute the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 12.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 12.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and that money damages would
not be an adequate remedy for any such harm. Prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section __ 11.01, the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in the courts referred to in Section _ ___ 12.08, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity without any requirement
for the posting of any bond or other security, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, subject to the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.
