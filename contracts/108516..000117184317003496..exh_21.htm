THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 2, 2017 (the "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Worthington Steel of Michigan, Inc., a
Michigan corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), Worthington Rhode Island Corporation,
a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser (" _Merger
Sub_ "), New AMTROL Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), and Aqua Stockholder Representative, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, as the representative of the Company Securityholders (the "
_Stockholder Representative_ ").

  



  

 _R E C I T A L S:_

  



  

Purchaser desires to acquire the Company through the merger (the " _Merger_
") of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), with the Company being the surviving
corporation in the Merger.

  



  

The Board of Directors of each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company have
(a) determined that it is advisable, fair to, and in the best interest of,
their respective equity holders for Purchaser to acquire the Company through
the Merger, after which the Company shall be a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Purchaser, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (c) in the case of the Board
of Directors of the Company, recommended that the Company Stockholders approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger.

  



  

Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the
Company Optionholders has executed and delivered an agreement in the form
attached as _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement (each, an " _Option Termination
Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Option Termination Agreements_ ")
pursuant to which each of the Company Optionholders has consented to and
approved the treatment of their respective Options pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 2.4(e) and the appointment of the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to _Article V_ , provided a release of claims in
favor of the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser and their Affiliates,
waived their entitlement to appraisal rights in respect of the Merger, and

Stock have completed all actions required to deem the Merger a "Liquidation
Event" (as defined in the Company Charter) in accordance with Article IV,

As promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company Stockholders owning at least ninety-five percent (95%)
of the Voting Stock (the " _Approval Percentage Stockholders_ ") shall adopt
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by
written consent in accordance with the DGCL, the Company Charter and the
Company's by-laws (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as
follows:

necessary to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified Person against Damages, the

Purchaser Indemnified Person for a taxable year shall be the excess, if any,
of (a) such Purchaser Indemnified Person's cumulative Liability for Taxes

extent permitted by relevant Tax Law and treating such Tax items as the last
items claimed for any taxable year); _provided_ , _however_ , that
net operating loss carrybacks from future taxable years shall not reduce the
net Tax benefit. If a net Tax benefit is not realized in or prior to the
taxable period during which an indemnifying party makes an indemnification
payment or the Purchaser Indemnified Person incurs or pays any Damages, the
Purchaser Indemnified Person shall thereafter make payments in accordance with
Section 10.1 to the indemnifying party to reflect the net Tax benefit
actually realized in each subsequent taxable period ending on or

calculation of any such net Tax benefit shall be performed by Purchaser
(which calculation shall be made in good faith and shall be accompanied by a
reasonable detailed written explanation thereof delivered to the Stockholder
Representative) and be binding on all parties hereto, absent manifest error.

(d)   _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that
is held by a Company Stockholder (i) who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing, (ii) who shall have properly demanded in
writing appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Section 262 and (iii) who has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost
the right to such payment (each such share, a " _Dissenting Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive any portion of the consideration specified in Section
2.4(c), but rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section
262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Company Stockholder shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such Company Stockholder to be paid the
fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the
applicable consideration specified in Section 2.4(c), without any interest
thereon.

  



  

(e)   _Company Options_. As contemplated by and in accordance
with the Option Termination Agreements, each Option, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the

right to receive from the Surviving Corporation (or a Subsidiary thereof) or
Purchaser, in accordance with this Section 2.4(e) and the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, the following:

  



  

(i)  Upon the Effective Time, a cash payment, if any, in an
amount equal to the Per Common Share Closing Merger Consideration with
respect to each share of Common Stock underlying such Option with the
aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent, _minus_
the exercise price for each share of Common Stock underlying such Option (the
" _Closing Option Payment Amount_ "), such amount to be paid to the holder of
such Option as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time
either (1) through the payroll of the appropriate Amtrol Company (without
interest), less such amount as is required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code or any applicable provision of applicable Law with respect to making
such payment in the amount (with regard to each Company Optionholder who was
an employee of any Amtrol Company at the time the Option was issued) or (2)
by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds (with regard to each
Company Optionholder who was not an employee of any Amtrol Company at the
time the Option was issued); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing
Option Payment Amount is equal to or less than zero ($0), then such Option
shall not be eligible to receive any portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration.

  



  

   

27 
--- 

 



    

(ii)  Following the Effective Time, upon any Post-Closing
Payment, a cash payment in an amount equal to the Per Common Share Post-
Closing Payment with respect to each share of Common Stock underlying such
Option with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest
cent, _minus_ , to the extent that such Post-Closing Payment is the first
payment hereunder with respect to which such Option is an Eligible Option,
the exercise price for each share of Common Stock underlying such Option, such
amount to be paid to the holder of such Option as soon as reasonably
practicable following such Post-Closing Payment either (1) through the
payroll of the appropriate Amtrol Company (without interest), less such amount
as is required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any applicable
provision of applicable Law with respect to making such payment in the amount
(with regard to each Company Optionholder who was an employee of any Amtrol
Company at the time the Option was issued) or (2) by check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds (with regard to each Company
Optionholder who was not an employee of any Amtrol Company at the time the
Option was issued); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Post-Closing Payment
taken together with all prior Post-Closing Payments are in the aggregate
equal to or less than zero ($0), then such Option shall not be eligible to
receive any portion of such applicable Post-Closing Payment.

  



  

(iii)  For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid to a Company
Optionholder pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(i) and Section 2.4(e)(ii) shall be
contributed by Purchaser to the Company, and paid by the Company to the
Company Optionholder as payment in cancellation of the Option.

  



  

2.5.   _Stock Certificates_. Each certificate that, before the
Effective Time, represented shares of Preferred Stock or shares of Common
Stock will, from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, evidence only
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration and Post-Closing Payments, if any, as described in _Article
III_.

  



  

2.6.   _Withholding Rights_. Each of Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and the Stockholder Representative, together with their
respective agents, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other applicable Tax Law. The parties intend that the
Stockholder Representative be given notice five (5) days prior to such
withholding to the extent it relates to payments being made after the Closing
Date. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative, or their respective
agents, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative, or their
respective agents, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Body and (b)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative, or
their respective agents, as the case may be.

3.8.   _Reserve Account_. The Stockholder Representative may
establish a reserve account (the " _Reserve Account_ ") on account of all
Company Securityholders in an aggregate amount determined by the Stockholder
Representative in its sole discretion (the amount so established, the "
_Reserve Amount_ ") to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred by or for the
benefit of the Company Securityholders on or after the Closing in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to
Section 3.6. The Reserve Amount shall be payable from the Merger
Consideration. Upon the written request of the Stockholder Representative
given to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, at the
Closing, Purchaser shall wire transfer the amount identified by the
Stockholder Representative as the Reserve Amount in immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Stockholder Representative. To the
extent amounts placed into the Reserve Account are not used, or in the
judgment of the Stockholder Representative are not expected to be used, to
pay costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including costs associated with
any indemnification claims, such remaining amount, together with all earnings
thereon, shall be distributed to the Paying Agent to deposit into the Payment
Fund and disburse to the applicable Company Securityholders as a Post-Closing
Payment hereunder, in each case as determined pursuant to and in accordance

exclusive authority to disburse and pay amounts placed into the
Reserve Account consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, including
delivering any such amounts to the Paying Agent to deposit into the Payment
Fund and disburse to the applicable Company Securityholders in accordance with
the written instructions of the Stockholder Representative.

3.9.   _Surrender and Payment to Company Securityholders_.

  



  

(a)   _Deposit With Paying Agent_. Delaware Trust Company shall
be engaged to act as the paying agent (in such capacity, the " _Paying Agent_
") for the purpose of exchanging Share Certificates for the Estimated Merger
Consideration, in accordance with Section 2.4 and this _Article III_ , and
also for the purposes of distributing any additional amounts received by the
Paying Agent in accordance with Section 3.10 or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for
the benefit of the Company Securityholders, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on behalf of all Company Securityholders, an amount equal
to: (i) the Estimated Merger Consideration (as set forth in the Pre-Closing
Calculation) _less_ (ii) the _sum_  of (A) the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
(B) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, (C) the Reserve Amount and (D) the sum of
the Closing Option Payment Amounts for all of the Options (such amount
required to be deposited with the Paying Agent, together with any additional
amounts deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.10 or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement, the " _Payment Fund_ ") to be held by the Paying
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement and this
Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the
payment of the Estimated Merger Consideration and additional amounts pursuant
to Section 3.8 and Section 3.10, and the Payment Fund shall not be subject to
any claim of Purchaser, including claims under Section 3.10, _Article X_ or
otherwise. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in a money
market account or in such other investment(s) as may be mutually agreed upon
by the parties hereto. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investment shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.
The parties hereto agree to treat such net profit, interest, or income
described in the preceding sentence as owned by the Surviving Corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and to file all Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with such treatment) to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(b)   _Share Exchange Procedures_. At or after the Closing, each
Company Stockholder shall surrender to the Paying Agent the certificates
evidencing such Person's shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock (the "
_Share Certificates_ ") for cancellation, together with a completed and
executed letter of transmittal, in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit
F_ hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), upon which the Paying Agent
shall pay from the Payment Fund to the holder of each such Share Certificate,
in exchange therefor, the amount of cash in immediately available funds which
such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Preferred
Stock or the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such Share
Certificate pursuant to Section 2.4(c), and the Share Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the relevant portion of the Merger Consideration may be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Share Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Share Certificate representing such Shares
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the relevant portion of the Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Share Certificate or
establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.9(b), each Share Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
(or at such other applicable time) such portion of the Merger Consideration
(and adjustments thereto pursuant to this Agreement) to which the holder of
such Share Certificate is entitled pursuant and subject to _Article II_ and
this _Article III_ , subject to the indemnification obligations set forth in
_Article X_. In the event any Share Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent will issue the portion of the Merger Consideration (and
adjustments thereto pursuant to this Agreement) to which such Person is
entitled pursuant and subject to _Article II_ and this _Article III_ , in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate. Delivery of
such affidavit shall be deemed delivery of a Share Certificate with
respect to the relevant Shares for purposes of this _Article III_.

  



  

   

32 
--- 

 



    

(c)   _Post-Closing Payments_. From and after the Closing, (i)
with respect to each Company Stockholder who surrendered to the Paying Agent
such Company Stockholder's Share Certificates for cancellation, together with
a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent shall pay
from the Payment Fund to such Company Stockholder any and all additional
amounts of cash in immediately available funds which such Company Stockholder
has the right to receive in connection with any Post-Closing Payments, in
each case in accordance with the written instructions of the Stockholder
Representative, and (ii) with respect to each Company Optionholder who holds
an Eligible Option and who delivered an Option Termination Agreement, the
Paying Agent shall pay from the Payment Fund to the Surviving Corporation for
payment to the applicable Company Optionholder either (1) through the payroll
of the appropriate Amtrol Company (without interest), _less_ such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any applicable
provision of applicable Law with respect to making such payment in the amount
(with regard to each Company Optionholder who was an employee of any Amtrol
Company at the time the Options were issued) or (2) by check or wire transfer
of immediately available funds (with regard to each Company Optionholder who
was not an employee of any Amtrol Company at the time the Options were
issued), any and all additional amounts of cash in immediately available funds
which such holder has the right to receive in connection with any Post-
Closing Payments, in each case in accordance with the written instructions
of the Stockholder Representative.

  



  

3.10.   _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

  



  

(a)  No later than the 75th day following the Closing Date (the
" _Delivery Date_ "), Purchaser will prepare and deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Amtrol Companies as of the
Adjustment Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement
(the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Purchaser's calculation of the
Merger Consideration and each of the components thereof, including a
presentation of the calculations of the items comprising the Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Company Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses
as of the Closing Date. Purchaser will prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein) in
accordance with Section 3.10(e). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
no adjustments shall be made to the Working Capital Target.

  



  

(b)  During the sixty (60)-day period immediately following the
Stockholder Representative's receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement, or in the event Purchaser shall fail to deliver the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement on or prior to the Delivery Date (in
which case, at the Stockholder Representative's option, the Pre-Closing
Calculation delivered in accordance with Section 3.3 will be deemed to be the
Closing Statement and the Estimated Merger Consideration set forth therein
will be deemed to be the Final Merger Consideration for all purposes hereof),
during the sixty (60)-day period immediately following the Delivery Date, the
Stockholder Representative and its representatives (1) will be permitted to
review, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, the
Company's and Purchaser's books and records and the working papers (but not
the working papers of the Company's or Purchaser's accounting firm) that are
relevant to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement (including the determinations included therein), and (2) will be
given access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
knowledgeable employees and accounting professionals of Purchaser and the
Company as are reasonably necessary and relevant to facilitate the Stockholder
Representative's review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the
determinations included therein) will become final, binding and conclusive
upon Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative upon the earliest to
occur of:

  



  

   

33 
--- 

 



    

(i)  the 60th day following the Stockholder Representative's
receipt thereof, unless Purchaser receives from the
Stockholder Representative prior to such 60th day written notice of the
Stockholder Representative's disagreement (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") with any
account or determination set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing
Statement, which Dispute Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature
and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted (collectively, the "
_Disputed Items_ ");

  



  

(ii)  notification by the Stockholder Representative to
Purchaser that the Stockholder Representative does not dispute the
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement;

  



  

(iii)  in the event that Purchaser shall have failed to deliver
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement on or prior to the
Delivery Date, election by the Stockholder Representative that the Pre-Closing
Calculation delivered in accordance with Section 3.3 will be deemed to be the
Closing Statement;

  



  

(iv)  the date on which Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative resolve in writing all differences they have with respect to
the Disputed Items; and

  



  

(v)  the date on which all of the Unresolved Items are finally
resolved in writing by the Independent Accountants in accordance with Section
3.10(c).

  



  

   

34 
--- 

 



    

(c)  During the thirty (30) days following delivery of a
Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they have with respect
to all of the Disputed Items. Any Disputed Item resolved in writing by
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will be deemed final, binding and
conclusive on Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative. Notwithstanding
anything in _Article X_ , if Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative
do not reach agreement on all of the Disputed Items during such thirty
(30)-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually agree), then at
the end of such thirty (30)-day (or longer) period, Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative will submit all unresolved Disputed Items
(collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the
" _Independent Accountants_ ") to review and resolve such matters. In the
event PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling to review and resolve such
matters, Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall work in good faith
to agree upon and engage a suitable accounting firm to fill the role of the
Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants will determine each
Unresolved Item (the amount of which may not be more favorable to Purchaser
than the related amount reflected in the Closing Statement nor more favorable
to the Stockholder Representative than the related amount set forth in the
Dispute Notice) in accordance with Section 3.10(e) as promptly as may be
reasonably practicable, and Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative will
instruct the Independent Accountants to endeavor to complete such process
within a period of no more than sixty (60) days. The Independent Accountants
may conduct such proceedings as the Independent Accountants believe, in their
sole discretion, will assist in the determination of the Unresolved Items;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative may otherwise agree, all communications between Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative or any of their respective representatives, on
the one hand, and the Independent Accountants, on the other hand, will be in
writing with copies simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party.
For purposes of the review by the Independent Accountants, the Independent
Accountants shall make their determination based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative
and not pursuant to any independent audit or review. The Independent
Accountants' determination of the Unresolved Items, and the calculation of
the Merger Consideration resulting therefrom, will be final, binding and
conclusive on Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative, effective as of
the date the Independent Accountants' written determination is received by
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative. Each of Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative will bear its own legal, accounting and other fees
and expenses of participating in such dispute resolution procedure. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred pursuant to this Section
3.10(c) (the " _Accounting Fees_ ") shall be allocated between Purchaser, on
the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, as
follows: a portion of the Accounting Fees equal to the product of the
Accounting Fees and a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate
dollar amount of the Disputed Items resolved by the Independent
Accountants in favor of Purchaser and the denominator of which is the
aggregate dollar amount of all Disputed Items submitted to the
Independent Accountants for resolution, shall be allocated to the Stockholder
Representative, and the remainder shall be allocated to Purchaser (in each
case as finally determined by the Independent Accountants).

  



  

(d)  (i) Subject to Section 3.10(f), upon final determination
of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.10(b) or Section 3.10(c)
(as applicable) (the " _Final Merger Consideration_ "), if the Estimated
Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger Consideration, the Stockholder
Representative and Purchaser shall within three (3) Business Days of
the determination of the Final Merger Consideration issue joint written
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Purchaser the amount of
such excess out of the Adjustment Escrow Account by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by Purchaser; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the amount of such excess is greater than the amount of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then the Stockholder Representative and
Purchaser shall issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent
to pay the amount of such shortfall out of the Indemnification Escrow Account
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by
Purchaser.

  



  

   

35 
--- 

 



    

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration, Purchaser will pay to the Paying Agent for deposit into the
Payment Fund, the amount of such excess, which amount will thereafter be
promptly distributed to the Company Securityholders in accordance with
Section 2.4 and the written instructions of the Stockholder Representative.
Any amount payable by Purchaser to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section
3.10(d)(ii) will be paid within three (3) Business Days of the
determination of the Final Merger Consideration by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

  



  

(iii) (1) No later than the 100th day following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a written
statement of the amount of Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities paid on or prior to,
or expected to be paid after, such date, together with a statement
setting forth Purchaser's calculation of such amount. In the event that the
Stockholder Representative reasonably disagrees with any aspect of such
computation and provides written notice of such disagreement (a " _Tax
Objection Notice_ ") to Purchaser within ten (10) Business Days after receipt
of such computation (the " _Objection Deadline_ "), time being of the
essence, any disagreement which is not resolved by mutual agreement of
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative within ten (10) Business Days
following the Stockholder Representative's delivery of the Tax Objection
Notice will be resolved by the Independent Accountants in accordance with the
same rules and procedures set forth in Section 3.10(c), whose resolution
shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. Purchaser and
the Stockholder Representative will instruct the Independent Accountants to
endeavor to complete such process within a period of no more than sixty (60)
days. The fees of the Independent Accountants shall be allocated pursuant to
the procedure set forth in Section 7.4(a)(i). In the event that Purchaser does
not receive such written notice from the Stockholder Representative by the
Objection Deadline, then Purchaser's computation of the Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities shall be final. No later than two (2) Business Days following the
date on which the amount of the Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities is been finalized
pursuant to this Section 3.10(d)(iii)(1), Purchaser and the Stockholder
Representative will issue a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent, to
pay to Purchaser any such Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities for which Purchaser
has not previously received payment from the Company Securityholders through
payment from the Adjustment Escrow Account or offset against Post-Closing
Payments as provided in Section 3.10(f).

  



  

(2) (A) Promptly after the Adjustment Escrow Release Date, Purchaser and the
Stockholder Representative will issue joint written instructions directing the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Stockholder Representative any amount remaining in
the Adjustment Escrow Account which is not subject to a dispute between the
parties and the amount subject to dispute shall be retained in the Adjustment
Escrow Account;

  



  

 (B) Any amount in the Adjustment Escrow Account that is subject to dispute shall be released from the Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to a joint written instruction from Purchaser and Stockholder Representative, in accordance with the manner in which the dispute at issue are resolved; and

 (C) Promptly after the Adjustment Escrow Release Date, Purchaser shall pay to the Stockholder Representative, any Post-Closing Payments to which the Company Securityholders are entitled, which Purchaser has received but have been held consistent with Section 3.10(f) (the amount of which Post-Closing Payments shall have been reduced, for the avoidance of doubt, by amounts that Purchaser has elected to offset against such Post-Closing Payments as described in Section 3.10(f)(ii), and any portion of such Post-Closing Payments that Purchaser has deposited into the Adjustment Escrow Account or the Indemnification Escrow Account as described in Section 3.10(f)(iii)); provided that if there is a dispute between Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative and the amount in dispute exceeds the amount in the Adjustment Escrow Account, Purchaser may retain an amount equal to the excess until the dispute is settled.

  



  

(e)  For the purposes of this _Article III_ , each amount
included in the Pre-Closing Calculation, the Closing Statement and the
Closing Balance Sheet will (i) be prepared in accordance with GAAP with the
modification reflected in _Schedule 3.10(e)_ and calculated utilizing the
accounting principles, policies, practices and methods reflected on _Schedule
3.10(e)_ hereto and (ii) be consistent with the audited Financial Statements
delivered to Purchaser pursuant to Section 4.6.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) in no event shall Purchaser be required to make any Post-
Closing Payment to the Stockholder Representative (for distribution to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with Section 2.4) with respect to the
post-Closing adjustments contemplated by this Section 3.10 (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any payments contemplated by Section 7.4 or elsewhere in
this Agreement) until after the Adjustment Escrow Release Date; and (ii)
Purchaser shall be entitled to offset against any Post-Closing Payments due
to the Stockholder Representative (for distribution to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with Section 2.4), any amounts owed to
Purchaser by the Company Securityholders with respect to the post-Closing
adjustments contemplated by this Section 3.10, or any Pre-Closing Tax
Liability; and (iii) to the extent that any amount has been distributed out
of (A) the Adjustment Escrow Account, or (B) the Indemnification Escrow
Account to reimburse Purchaser with respect to the post-Closing adjustments
contemplated by this Section 3.10, or any Pre-Closing Tax Liability, instead
of paying any Post-Closing Payment that the Stockholder Representative is
otherwise entitled to pursuant to the application of Section 7.4(a)(ii) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Purchaser may deposit such Post-Closing Payment
(up to the aggregate amount of the previous distributions from such account
described in clauses (A) and (B) above) into the Adjustment Escrow Account or
the Indemnification Escrow Account, as applicable, on behalf of the Company
Securityholders; provided however, that in no event shall the Purchaser
deposit any additional amounts into the Adjustment Escrow Account following
the Adjustment Escrow Release Date.

  



  

(g)  If at any time Purchaser believes it will be entitled to
payment out of the Adjustment Escrow Account or the Indemnification Escrow
Account as a result of the determination of the Final Merger Consideration,
due to any Pre-Closing Tax Liability or for any other matter provided for in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to make a claim against the
Adjustment Escrow Account or the Indemnification Escrow Account, as
applicable, for such matter and the amount so claimed shall be held in the
Adjustment Escrow Account or the Indemnification Escrow Account, as
applicable, until the matter is finally resolved and payment is made
with respect thereto pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

assets and to carry on their respective businesses as now conducted. Each
Amtrol Company is duly qualified or authorized to do business as a foreign
entity and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which
it owns or leases real property and each other jurisdiction in which the
conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties or assets requires
such qualification or authorization, except where the failure to be so
qualified, authorized or in good standing has not had, and will not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
made available to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of the
organizational and governing documents of each of the Amtrol Companies as

the Company Stockholder Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Company
Documents and, after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the
Company and no other or further action or proceeding on the part of the

duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and
thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and each of the Company Documents when so

of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies
generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity,

accordance with the respective past custom and practice of the Amtrol
Companies in respect of their businesses.

Business. The quantity of such Inventory is reasonable in accordance with the
present circumstances of the Amtrol Companies with respect to their respective
businesses.

(a)  By voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger, by
executing and delivering a Letter of Transmittal or, with regard to the
Company Optionholders, by executing an Option Termination Agreement, and
without any further action on the part of any Person, each Company
Securityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and appointed
the Stockholder Representative as such Company Securityholder's attorney-in-
fact and agent for and on behalf of such Company Securityholder with respect
to the post-Closing adjustments contemplated by Section 3.10, claims for
indemnification under _Article X_ and the taking by the Stockholder
Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required
or permitted to be taken by the Stockholder Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to:
(i) authorize the release or delivery to Purchaser of all or any portion of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount in satisfaction of the Company
Securityholders' obligations (if any) with respect to the post-Closing
adjustments contemplated by Section 3.10 (and in connection
therewith calculating the portion of any adjustment in the Company
Securityholders' favor that is payable to any Company Securityholder); (ii)
authorize the release or delivery to Purchaser of all or any portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount in satisfaction of the Company Securityholders'
obligations (if any) with respect to indemnification claims by Purchaser or

of Purchaser or Merger Sub under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;
(vii) determine the Pro Rata Share of each Company Securityholder from time
to time and all amounts for which a Company Securityholder may be entitled
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement from time to time, and (viii) take
all actions necessary in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing and any other post-Closing matters. The
Stockholder Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of
each Company Securityholder that has approved and consented to the Merger, or
executed and delivered a Letter of Transmittal or executed and delivered an
Option Termination Agreement with respect to the disposition, settlement or
other handling of the adjustments contemplated by Section 3.10 and all claims
under _Article X_ and all rights or obligations arising under Section 3.10
and _Article X_. The Company Securityholders that approve and consent to the
Merger, execute and deliver a Letter of Transmittal or execute and deliver an
Option Termination Agreement shall be bound by all actions taken and documents
executed by the Stockholder Representative in connection with Section 3.10
and _Article X_ , and Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on any action or
decision of the Stockholder Representative. In performing the functions
specified in this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative may act upon any
instrument or other writing believed by the Stockholder Representative to be
genuine and to be signed or presented by the proper Person and shall not have
any fiduciary duty to any Person and shall not be liable in connection with
the performance by it of its duties pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder Representative. Each Company
Securityholder that approves the Merger, executes and delivers a Letter of
Transmittal or executes and delivers an Option Termination Agreement hereby
and thereby agrees that the Stockholder Representative and its agents and
representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless (including out of
funds that otherwise are to be distributed from the Escrow Account to the
Company Securityholders, if any, as described in the following sentence) from
and against any loss, Liability, cost or expense incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder. Any out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with
actions taken by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of
Section 3.10 and _Article X_ (including the hiring of legal counsel and the
incurring of legal fees, expenses and

  



  

   

63 
--- 

 



    

costs) (" _Representative Expenses_ ") shall be the responsibility of the
Company Securityholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, from time to time after the Closing Date, in the event that
the Stockholder Representative determines that the Reserve Amount and earnings
thereon is not sufficient to pay actual or anticipated Representative
Expenses, each Company Stockholder that has approved and consented to the
Merger or executed and delivered a Letter of Transmittal, and each Company
Optionholder pursuant to their Option Termination Agreement, shall be
obligated, within ten (10) days after written notice from the Stockholder
Representative, to contribute to the Reserve Account such Company
Securityholder's Pro Rata Share of the additional aggregate amount of
additional Reserve Amount that the Stockholder Representative determines is
necessary, which amount shall be set forth in such written notice. Upon final
distributions of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, respectively, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Stockholder
Representative, out of the aggregate portion of funds in the Escrow Account
that otherwise are to be distributed to the Company Securityholders, if any,
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, any unpaid
Representative Expenses in accordance with the written instructions of the
Stockholder Representative. Upon any post-Closing distributions of the Payment
Fund, the Paying Agent shall pay to the Stockholder Representative, out of
the aggregate portion of funds in the Payment Fund that otherwise are to be
distributed to the Company Securityholders, if any, pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, any unpaid Representative Expenses in accordance with the
written instructions of the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder
Representative may withhold a disproportionate amount from any Company
Securityholder(s) that were the cause of any Representative Expenses. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative
shall have full power and authority to interpret all the terms and provisions
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and to consent to any amendment,
modification or waiver hereof or thereof, on behalf of all the Company
Securityholders and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.

  



  

(b)  Each Company Securityholder that approves and consents to
the Merger, executes and delivers a Letter of Transmittal or executes and
delivers an Option Termination Agreement shall be deemed to have irrevocably
appointed and constituted the Stockholder Representative the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of such Company Securityholder, with full power in such
Company Securityholder's name and on such Company Securityholder's behalf to
act according to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in
the absolute discretion of the Stockholder Representative; and in general to
do all things and to perform all acts including, without limitation,
executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements,
certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments contemplated by
or deemed advisable in connection with the Escrow Agreement. This power of
attorney and all authority hereby conferred is coupled with an interest and
is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act
of any Company Securityholder, by operation of law, whether by such Company
Securityholder's death, disability, protective supervision or any other
event. Without limiting the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the
performance of a special obligation and, accordingly, by approval of the
Merger, by executing and delivering the applicable Letter of Transmittal or by
executing and delivering an Option Termination Agreement, each Company
Securityholder shall be deemed to have waived and renounced such
Company Securityholder's right to renounce this power of attorney
unilaterally at any time. By approval of the Merger, by executing and
delivering the applicable Letter of Transmittal or by executing and delivering
an Option Termination Agreement, each Company Securityholder shall be deemed
to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate
or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder Representative taken under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power of attorney
granted in this _Article V_ , no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or
other act or document shall be ineffective solely by reason of a Company
Securityholder (instead of the Stockholder Representative) having signed or
given the same directly.

(c)  By voting in favor of or consenting to the Merger, by
executing and delivering a Letter of Transmittal or, with regard to the
Company Optionholders, by executing an Option Termination Agreement, and
without any further action on the part of any Person, each Company
Securityholder shall be deemed to have agreed that, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the Allocation Statement for all
purposes hereunder and shall have no Liability to any Company Securityholder,
the Stockholder Representative or any other Person for the determination of
the amounts payable to the Company Securityholders hereunder or the manner in
which or the Persons to whom such amounts are paid pursuant to this Agreement
(regardless of which Person makes the payments) or any calculations required
to be made under this Agreement with respect thereto. The immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed a waiver by each of the Company
Securityholders and the Stockholder Representative of claims against

Article VII 
  
 COVENANTS

  



  

7.1.   _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that the
information provided to Purchaser in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement between Worthington Industries, Inc. and the
Company dated April 12, 2016, (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms
of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon,
the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate without
further action on the part of Purchaser or the Company.

  



  

7.2.   _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser
will not, and will not permit the Company to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Company's organizational and governing documents relating to
the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses applicable to the
current (as of immediately prior to the Closing Date) and former officers and
directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (each, as previously
identified by the Company to Purchaser, an " _D andO Indemnified Person_") in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights of such officers and directors,
except as required by applicable Law, it being the intent of the parties that
the current officers and directors of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
will continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses to the full extent currently provided in the
Company's organizational and governing documents.

  



  

(b)  As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has obtained
and fully paid for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies (" _Tail Insurance_
") naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims
period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date (the " _Tail Period_
") from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors' liability
insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing, Purchaser will not, or will
cause the Company not to, cancel or change such Tail Insurance coverage
during the Tail Period. The Company shall provide sufficient evidence to
Purchaser that such Tail Insurance has been bound no later than the Closing.

  



  

(c)  In the event that all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of
transactions, then Purchaser and the Company will, in each such case, ensure
that the successors and assigns of the Company assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.2. The provisions of this Section 7.2 will apply to
all of the successors and assigns of the Company.

  



  

(d)  The provisions of this Section 7.2 are intended for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by (as express third-party
beneficiaries), each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives, successors and assigns and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have had by Contract or otherwise.

  



  

   

68 
--- 

 



    

7.3.   _Public Announcements_. The parties have approved the press
release to be issued by Purchaser's parent in connection with the execution
of this Agreement. Prior to the issuance of such press release, none of the
parties hereto or any of their respective representatives or Affiliates shall
issue or cause to be issued a press release or other public announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby. Thereafter, neither the
Company Securityholders nor the Stockholder Representative nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall publicly disclose any information concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Amtrol Companies which is
confidential or non-public, without the consent of Purchaser (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Nothing
contained in this Section 7.3 shall prevent a party hereto from (a) sharing
this Agreement and the terms hereof on a confidential basis with any of its
direct or indirect partners, investors, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, Affiliates or agents, or in connection with any filings
required by the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Laws or (b) making
any disclosure that is required by Law or the rules, regulations or listing
standards of the SEC or any national securities exchange.

  



  

7.4.   _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Purchaser and the Company
Securityholders for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date.

  



  

(a)   _Filing of Taxes_.

  



  

(i)  Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed (taking into
account extensions of time to file) by the Amtrol Companies after the Closing
Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each such return, a " _Pre-
Closing Tax Return_ "). Each Pre-Closing Tax Return (other than a Pre-Closing
Tax Return that relates to a Foreign Company New Taxable Year) shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, except as required by
applicable Tax Law. Each such Pre-Closing Tax Return that is an Income Tax
Return (each such Income Tax Return, a " _Pre-Closing Income Tax Return_ ")
will be submitted by Purchaser to the Stockholder Representative (together
with schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by the Stockholder
Representative, supporting documentation) at least thirty (30) days before
the due date (including extensions) of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return.
Purchaser shall permit the Stockholder Representative and its agents or
designees to review and comment on each such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return. In
the event that the Stockholder Representative reasonably disagrees with any
aspect of any such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return that relates to a Tax
Liability for which the Company Securityholders would be responsible under
Section 7.4(k) and provides written notice of such disagreement to Purchaser
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return,
time being of the essence, the

  



  

   

69 
--- 

 



    

disagreement will be resolved by the Independent Accountants, whose
resolution shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. No
amount shall be released from the Adjustment Escrow Account to the
Stockholder Representative until after the Adjustment Escrow Release
Date. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred pursuant
to this Section 7.4(a)(i) shall be allocated between Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, as follows: a
portion of such accounting fees equal to the product of such accounting fees
and a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar amount of the
disputed items resolved by the Independent Accountants in favor of Purchaser
and the denominator of which is the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed
items submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution, shall be
allocated to the Stockholder Representative, and the remainder shall be
allocated to Purchaser (in each case as finally determined by the Independent
Accountants). To the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, such Pre-Closing
Income Tax Returns shall reflect all Company Transaction Expenses in the
portion of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns ending on the Closing Date.
The Company Securityholders will be responsible for all Taxes of the Amtrol
Companies paid or to be paid after the Closing and attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (excluding Excluded Taxes, and any Taxes to the extent of
the amount included and specifically identified as a Liability for such Taxes
in the Closing Working Capital) (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Liability_ "). As
described in Section 3.10(f), Purchaser shall be entitled to offset against
any payment of a Tax refund that the Stockholder Representative is otherwise
entitled to receive pursuant to the application of Section 7.4(a)(ii), any
Pre-Closing Tax Liability. Alternatively, at Purchaser's request, the
Stockholder Representative and Purchaser will jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to promptly pay an amount equal to any Pre-Closing Tax Liability to
Purchaser out of the Adjustment Escrow Amount (or, to the extent that funds in
the Adjustment Escrow Account at such time are insufficient to pay the amount
of such excess, out of the Indemnification Escrow Account).

  



  

(ii)  At the sole cost and expense of the Company
Securityholders to be satisfied out of the Adjustment Escrow Amount (or,
if necessary, the Indemnification Escrow Account or through an offset against
Post-Closing Payments under Section 3.10(f)), the Company shall elect to
carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit relating to a Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date and reflected on such Pre-Closing Income
Tax Returns to its prior taxable years to the extent permitted by applicable
Tax Law and Purchaser shall cause the Company to file IRS Form 1139 (and/or
analogous U.S. state or local form relating to a Tax refund) and/or any
amended Tax Return to the extent necessary to obtain any potential Tax
refunds related thereto. Purchaser shall send a draft of such IRS Form 1139
(and/or such analogous form) or amended Tax Return to the Stockholder
Representative for review no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to
filing, and the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to comment on
such IRS Form 1139 (and/or such analogous form) or amended Tax Return to the
extent such form or amended Tax Return is prepared inconsistent with this
Section. Any Tax refund resulting from the election and filings described in
this Section 7.4(a)(ii) shall be paid by Purchaser to the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section 3.10(d)(iii) following receipt
by Purchaser or any Amtrol Company of such refund; _provided_  that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no amount of such Tax refund shall be paid by Purchaser
until after the Adjustment Escrow Release Date.

  



  

   

70 
--- 

 



    

(iii)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser
and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders)
agree that, with respect to each of the Amtrol Companies that is organized in
a country other than the United States, elections will be filed with such
countries to the extent permissible under applicable Law, to cause the taxable
year of each such Amtrol Company to end as of May 31, 2017 (or as close to
that date as possible) for Income Tax purposes (the " _Short Year Termination
Date_ "), and for each such Amtrol Company to adopt a taxable year for Income
Tax purposes the first day of which is the day following the applicable Short
Year Termination Date.

  



  

(b)   _Allocation of Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of
this Agreement, with respect to any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes
based on or measured by income, sales, value-added, receipts, proceeds,
profits, employment or payroll of the Amtrol Companies will be treated as
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of the Closing Date, and the amount of all other Taxes
of the Amtrol Companies that become payable during a Straddle Period
(including property and other periodic Taxes, and whether such Taxes are
payable to a Governmental Body, a landlord or other third party), will be
treated as attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period based on a fraction, the
numerator of which is the total number of days from the beginning of the
Straddle Period through (and including) the Closing Date, and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period.

  



  

(c)  To the extent that, after the application of Section
7.4(a) and Section 7.4(g), Purchaser or the Company actually realizes a Tax
benefit in any Relevant Tax Period attributable to any Tax deduction for the
Company Transaction Expenses paid by the Company or by Purchaser for the
benefit of the Company and taken into account in determining the Final Merger
Consideration (" _Transaction Tax Deduction_ ") or any net operating loss
carryforward of the Company arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is
attributable to a Transaction Tax Deduction (" _TTD Carryforward_ ") then,
subject to the limitations set forth in the immediately following sentence,
the amount of the reduction in Taxes attributable to such Transaction Tax
Deduction or TTD Carryforward that is actually realized by Purchaser or the
Company in any Relevant Tax Period, determined in accordance with the
principles of Section 7.4(d) (a " _Transaction Tax Benefit_ ") shall be for
the account of the Company Securityholders. Purchaser will pay to the
Stockholder Representative (for distribution to the Company Securityholders in
accordance with Section 2.4) any Transaction Tax Benefit, net of any
reasonable expenses of obtaining such Transaction Tax Benefit (such payment, a
" _Transaction Tax Benefit Payment_ "), no later than ten (10) days after
filing the Income Tax Return for any Relevant Tax Period for which such
Transaction Tax Deduction or TTD Carryforward is applied or utilized (although
subject to Section 3.10(f)).

  



  

   

71 
--- 

 



    

(d)  The amount of the Transaction Tax Benefit for any Relevant
Tax Period shall be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the
cumulative Liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year payable
by the consolidated group that includes Purchaser, calculated by adding back,
solely for purposes of this clause (i), any Transaction Tax Deductions and any
TTD Carryforwards for such Relevant Tax Period, over (ii) the actual
cumulative Liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year payable by
the consolidated group that includes Purchaser, calculated by taking into
account any Transaction Tax Deductions and any TTD Carryforwards
attributable to the payment at issue for all taxable years (to the extent
permitted by relevant Tax Law and treating such Tax items as the last items
claimed for any taxable year); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) net operating
loss carrybacks from future taxable years shall not reduce the Transaction
Tax Benefit, and (B) TTD Carryforwards shall include only those amounts that
are available for use and have not been previously utilized in the foregoing
calculation. Promptly following the filing of its federal income Tax Return
for any year to which Section 7.4(a) or Section 7.4(c) applies, (1) Purchaser
shall notify the Stockholder Representative in writing of the amount of any
Transaction Tax Benefit (the " _Transaction Tax Benefit Notice_ ") and shall
provide a written schedule showing Purchaser's calculation of the Transaction
Tax Benefit (which calculation shall be made in good faith and shall be
accompanied by a reasonably detailed written explanation thereof delivered to
the Stockholder Representative) and be binding on all parties hereto without
any other party's review of any Books and Records or Tax Returns of
Purchaser; and (2) Purchaser shall notify the Stockholder Representative in
writing of the amount payable pursuant to Section 7.4(g) and shall provide a
written schedule in reasonable detail stating the calculation thereof. In the
event that Purchaser receives a written request from the Stockholder
Representative within ten (10) days of the receipt by the Stockholder
Representative of the Transaction Tax Benefit Notice, the computation of the
Transaction Tax Benefit shall be verified or modified in writing by the
Independent Accountants, whose determination as to the amount of the
Transaction Tax Benefit shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto effective as of the date that the Independent Accountants' written
determination is received by Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative,
absent manifest error. Purchaser shall provide the Independent Accountants
with all of the information reasonably requested by the Independent
Accountants in order for them to provide this determination, which
information shall be kept in confidence by the Independent Accountants and
not disclosed by the Independent Accountants to any other party hereto. The
fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants incurred in reviewing
any Transaction Tax Benefit calculation shall be shared by the parties as
follows: (I) the Company Securityholders shall be responsible for an amount
equal to the aggregate fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants
multiplied by a ratio, the numerator of which is equal to the
final Transaction Tax Benefit amount as determined by the Independent
Accountants, and the denominator of which is the Transaction Tax Benefit
amount as calculated by Purchaser, and (II) Purchaser shall be responsible for
an amount equal to the aggregate fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accountants, reduced by the amount of such fees and disbursements for which
the Company Securityholders are responsible pursuant to clause (I) above.

  



  

   

72 
--- 

 



    

(e)   _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  



  

(i)  Purchaser, the Company, and the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders) shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.4 and
any audit, claim, inquiry, examination or other proceeding relating to Taxes
(a " _Tax Claim_ "). Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other party's request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Claim and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Company and the Company Stockholders
agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Purchaser, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, the Company Stockholders shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records. The Company
Securityholders will provide the Stockholder Representative with all such
relevant information upon request.

  



  

(ii)  Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
the Company Securityholders) further agree, upon request, to use their best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby). The Company Securityholders will provide
the Stockholder Representative with all such relevant information upon
request.

  



  

(iii)  Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of
the Company Securityholders) further agree, upon request, to provide the
other party with all information that either party may be required to report
pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Company Securityholders will provide the Stockholder
Representative with all such relevant information upon request.

  



  

(iv)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4(d) to the
contrary, Purchaser shall not be required to provide any records, Tax Returns
or any other information to the Stockholder Representative, in each case which
includes any information relating to any member (other than an Amtrol
Company) of a consolidated, unity or combined group including Purchaser.

  



  

   

73 
--- 

 



    

(f)   _Tax Claims_.

  



  

(i)  The Stockholder Representative will have the right to
control (at the sole cost and expense of the Company Securityholders) the
conduct, defense and settlement, compromise or other disposition of any Tax
Claim relating solely to Taxes for which the Company Securityholders would be
obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons under Section 10.1,
which Taxes relate to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date and
would not reasonably be expected to result in Damages in excess of the funds
then remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account; _provided_ that, the
Stockholder Representative will promptly notify Purchaser of its intent to
control such Tax Claim, and to the extent the Stockholder Representative
controls such Tax Claim, the Stockholder Representative (1) must promptly
notify Purchaser of such Tax Claim and keep Purchaser reasonably informed of
all developments in such Tax Claim, (2) must afford Purchaser the reasonable
opportunity to participate (at its sole cost and expense) in the conduct and
resolution of such Tax Claim, (3) must conduct the defense actively and
diligently, and (4) may not settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of such
Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that any of
the conditions in clauses (1) through (4) of this Section 7.4(f)(i) is or
becomes unsatisfied, (A) Purchaser or a Purchaser Affiliate may control the
defense, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement, in any manner that they reasonably may deem appropriate, with the
prior consent of the Stockholder Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) the Company Securityholders
shall reimburse Purchaser promptly and periodically for the costs of such
defense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), and (C)
Purchaser's assumption of control over the Tax Claim shall not affect its
rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1 and Section 7.4(k).

  



  

(ii)  Purchaser shall have the right to control the conduct,
defense and settlement, compromise or other disposition of any Tax Claim that
(1) does not relate solely to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date, or (2) that relates solely to a Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date but with respect to which the Stockholder Representative did not
elect to control pursuant to Section 7.4(f); _provided_ that (A) with respect
to a Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period, Purchaser must promptly notify
the Stockholder Representative of such Tax Claim and must keep the Stockholder
Representative reasonably informed of all developments in such Tax Claim, and
(B) with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period or relating
solely to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date but with respect
to which the Stockholder Representative did not elect to control pursuant to
Section 7.4(f), Purchaser must (i) must afford the Stockholder Representative
the reasonable opportunity to participate (at the sole cost and expense of
the Company Securityholders) in the conduct and resolution of such Tax Claim,
(ii) must conduct the defense actively and diligently, and (iii) may not
settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of such Tax Claim without the prior
written consent of the Stockholder Representative, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

   

74 
--- 

 



    

(iii)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4(f) to the
contrary, the Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to participate
in or control any proceeding related to a Tax Claim, which proceeding involves
in whole or in part any Taxes of, or a Tax Return of, the consolidated,
unitary or combined group including Purchaser (or any member thereof other
than an Amtrol Company);  _provided_ that (1) in such event Purchaser shall
keep the Stockholder Representative fully informed and consult with the
Stockholder Representative with respect to such Tax Claim, and (2) Purchaser
may not settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of such Tax Claim (to the
extent that such claim relates to the Amtrol Companies) if indemnification is
to be sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  



  

(iv)  Notwithstanding anything in _Article X_ to the contrary,
this Section 7.4(f), and not Section 10.4, will govern the conduct of Tax
Claims.

  



  

(g)   _Tax Refunds_. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.4(a)
and Section 3.10(f), the Company Securityholders will be entitled to all
refunds actually received by an Amtrol Company that relate to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, net of all Taxes payable by Purchaser or the Company attributable
to the receipt of such refund (to the extent not included in the computation
of the Company Post-Closing Tax Payment or otherwise paid by the Company
Securityholders pursuant to Section 7.4(a)(i)), net of all costs and expenses
incurred by Purchaser or the Company in obtaining such refund, and net of any
Indemnified Taxes for which Purchaser or the Company has not then obtained
recovery or reimbursement; _provided_ that the Company Securityholders will
not be entitled to any refunds attributable to carrybacks from periods ending
after the Closing Date, or refunds that were reflected as assets in the
Closing Statement (including any estimated and pre-paid Tax payments). If
Purchaser or the Company receives any refund of Tax to which the Company
Securityholders are entitled pursuant to this Section 7.4(g), Purchaser will
pay (or cause the Company to pay) such refund of Tax (including any interest
received thereon) to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section
3.10(d)(iii),  _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, no amount of such
tax refund shall be paid by Purchaser until after the Adjustment Escrow
Release Date. In the event that Purchaser or the Company is required to repay
all or any portion of such refund of Tax (including any interest received
thereon) to the relevant Taxing Authority, the Stockholder Representative
shall, at the expense of the Company Securityholders, at the request of
Purchaser, repay to Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, the amount paid
over pursuant to this Section 7.4(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Taxing Authority) within five (5)
Business Days of such request. In applying this Section 7.4(g), any refund of
Taxes (including any interest thereon) for a Straddle Period will be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date in accordance with the principles of
Section 7.4(b). Purchaser shall be entitled to all refunds relating to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date
(including, without limitation, any refund that is attributable to any
net operating loss carryforward of the Company arising in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, or any tax credits or other tax attributes of the Company carried
forward from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date);  _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser shall make Transaction Tax Benefit Payments to the
Stockholder Representative (for distribution to the Company Securityholders
in accordance with Section 2.4) in accordance with Section 7.4(c).

(h)  For the avoidance of doubt, Section 7.4 is subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 3.10(f).

  



  

(i)   _Section 338 Election_. Without the prior written
consent of the Stockholder Representative (which may be withheld for any
reason), none of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person who
can make an election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code (a " _Section 338
Election_ ") or pursuant to Section 336 of the Code (a " _Section 336
Election_ ") with respect to the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, shall make a Section 338 Election or a Section 336, or make any
corresponding election pursuant to U.S. state, U.S. local or non-U.S. law,
with respect to the Surviving Corporation or any such Subsidiary.

  



  

(j)   _Buyer Tax Act_. Except to the extent permitted or
required by this Agreement or to the extent Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation receives the prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the
Stockholder Representative, neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation
shall file any amended Tax Return for a Tax period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, if the filing of such amended Tax Return would have the effect
of increasing the Tax Liability of the Surviving Corporation or the Company
Securityholders for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(k)   _Tax Indemnity_. Each of the Company Securityholders, by
virtue of the Merger, agrees, after the Effective Time, to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, without duplication from
Section 10.1(a), from and against any Indemnified Taxes and all Damages
arising out of or resulting from an Indemnified Tax, in each case subject to
the terms and limitations set forth in _Article X_.

  



  

7.5.   _Letters of Credit_. The Company has informed Purchaser that
it has had issued, for the benefit of the Amtrol Companies, certain letters
of credit set forth on _Schedule 7.5_ (collectively, the " _Letters of Credit_
"). At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall, at its sole election, either
(a) substitute replacement letters of credit for the Letters of Credit and
arrange for return and cancellation of the Letters of Credit without any
additional Liability to any of the Amtrol Companies or (b) have issued back-
to-back letters of credit or other credit support satisfactory to the
issuer(s) of such Letters of Credit.

be through the RandW Policy, and (ii) the aggregate liability of the Company
Securityholders for Damages pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iii), Section
10.1(a)(v) and Section 10.1(a)(vi) shall be limited to and payable solely from

Escrow Agreement) set forth in Claims Notices (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) filed with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Escrow Agreement prior to the Redemption Reduction Date. On
December 2, 2018, Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall give
written joint instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse promptly from the
Indemnification Escrow Account the remaining funds held in such account less
the sum of all unpaid Claims Amounts set forth in Claims Notices filed with
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Escrow

(iii)  The Company Securityholders shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section
10.1(a)(i), Section 10.1(a)(ii), Section 10.1(a)(iv) and Section 7.4(k) after
the exhaustion and/or release of the Indemnification Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and no obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iii),
Section 10.1(a)(v) and Section 10.1(a)(vi) after the exhaustion and/or release

accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If Purchaser is liable to
the Company Indemnified Persons for any Damages after a Final Determination
under Section 10.9, Purchaser shall pay the amount of any such finally

disburse to the applicable Company Securityholders in accordance with Section
2.4 and the written instructions of the Stockholder Representative within
five (5) Business Days following the Final Determination of Purchaser's
liability in accordance with Section 10.9, by wire transfer of cash or

(e)  The indemnification provided for in Section 10.1(a)(i)
shall not apply (except for breaches or inaccuracies of any
Fundamental Representations or any representation or warranty set forth in
Section 4.9 (Taxes)) unless and until the aggregate Damages so determined to
be due for which one or more Purchaser Indemnified Persons seeks or has sought
indemnification hereunder exceeds a cumulative aggregate amount equal to
$1,415,000 (subject to reduction as set forth in the last sentence of this
Section 10.1(e)) (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons shall, subject to the limitations contained in this _Article X_ , be
indemnified for all such Damages in excess of the Basket. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company Securityholders shall not be liable
for indemnification to Purchaser Indemnified Persons under Section 10.1(a)(i)
(except for breaches or inaccuracies of any Fundamental Representations or
any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.9 (Taxes)) for Damages
relating to a breach of representations and warranties under a Section of
this Agreement unless the aggregate Damages relating to all such claims
relating to breaches of representations and warranties under such Section are
greater than $25,000 (the " _Pre-Basket Amount_ "), in which case the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover for all such
Damages in connection with such claim or series of related claims (including
the Pre-Basket Amount); _provided_ that the amount of Damages which may be
excluded by application of the Pre-Basket Amount pursuant to this sentence
shall not exceed $125,000 in the aggregate. The Basket and the Pre-
Basket Amount shall not apply to any claims by any Purchaser Indemnified
Person based on breaches or inaccuracies of any Fundamental
Representations or any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.9
(Taxes), or to any claims under Section 10.1(a)(ii) through Section
10.1(a)(vi). The amount of the Basket shall be reduced (but not below zero),
effective as of the date on which the Retention Reduction Disbursal is made
to the Stockholder Representative by the Escrow Agent, by the sum of $943,333.

  



  

   

83 
--- 

 



    

(f)  The amount to which a Purchaser Indemnified Person may
become entitled under this _Article X_ shall be (i) calculated on an After-
Tax Basis, (ii) net of any amount actually received (whether by way of
payment, discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise) from a third
party which is not Affiliated with Purchaser, Merger Sub or a Purchaser
Indemnified Person (but excluding any amount recovered from the RandW Policy)
less any cost associated with receiving such recovery in respect of a Claim
and any related increases in insurance premiums and (iii) net of any reserves
established on the Amtrol Companies' closing balance sheet or liabilities to
the extent taken into account in the calculation of Closing Working Capital.
To the extent that insurance, "pass-through" warranty coverage from a
manufacturer or vendor or other form of recovery or reimbursement from a
third party is available to any Purchaser Indemnified Person to cover any
item for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, Purchaser will, or
will cause such Purchaser Indemnified Person to, on a timely and expeditious
basis, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect recovery under
applicable insurance policies and warranties and otherwise pursue to
conclusion available remedies or causes of action to recover the amount of
such Purchaser Indemnified Person's claim as may be available from such other
party. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, furnish
the Stockholder Representative with such information respecting the assets,
business and financial records of Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
relating to any claims for which Indemnification is sought against the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 10.1(a) as the Stockholder
Representative may, from time to time, reasonably request.

  



  

10.2.   _Indemnification of Company Securityholders_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to the limitations set forth herein, Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation shall, after the Effective Time (subject to the
terms and conditions of this _Article X_ ), indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company Securityholders and their Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, members, agents, representatives, successors
and assigns (the " _Company Indemnified Persons_ "), from and against any and
all Damages arising out of or resulting from:

  



  

(i)  any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty given or made by Purchaser or Merger Sub in this Agreement as of the
Closing or in any other Transaction Document to which Purchaser or Merger Sub
is a party; or

  



  

(ii)  any default in, breach, nonfulfillment or failure to
perform any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement;

  



  

 _provided_ that, only the Stockholder Representative may assert a claim for
indemnification on behalf of any Company Indemnified Person under this Section
10.2.

  



  

(b)  Any claim for indemnification made by the Stockholder
Representative (on behalf of a Company Indemnified Person) under this Section
10.2 must be raised in a writing delivered to Purchaser by no later than the
date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date.

10.3.   _Direct Claims_.

  



  

(a)  Notwithstanding anything in this _Article X_ to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 10.3 shall not apply with respect to
any Tax Claim governed by Section 7.4(f).

  



  

(b)  As used in this Section 10.3, the term " _Claim_ " means a
claim for indemnification by Purchaser on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified
Person or the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of any Company Indemnified
Person), as the case may be, for Damages pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section
10.2 of this Agreement (such Person making a Claim, an " _Indemnitee_ "). As
used herein, the term " _Indemnitor_ " means a party against whom a Claim is
asserted under this _Article X_. An Indemnitee seeking indemnification for a
Claim shall give the Indemnitor written notice of such Claim (a " _Notice
of Claim_ ") promptly after (and in no event more than thirty (30) days
after) such Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any potential Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that so long as such Notice of Claim is given on or
prior to the close of business on the last day of the survival period
applicable to such Claim pursuant to Section 10.6, then the failure to
provide such Notice of Claim within the time period provided for in this
Section 10.3(b) shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitee's right to indemnity
hereunder or relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, unless (and
then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor is actually materially
prejudiced thereby or otherwise forfeits material rights or defenses by reason
of such failure.

  



  

(c)  The Indemnitor shall notify the Indemnitee in writing ("
_Response_ ") within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Notice of Claim
(the " _Response Period_ ") if the Indemnitor accepts or disputes all or any
portion of such Claim. If the Indemnitor disputes all or any portion of the
Claim in its Response, then the Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall proceed in
good faith to promptly negotiate a resolution of any such dispute. If the
Indemnitor and Indemnitee are unable to mutually resolve such dispute within
thirty (30) days of the date of the Indemnitee received the Response, then the
parties may proceed and pursue any and all remedies available to them at law,
subject to those limitations set forth in this _Article X_. If the
Indemnitor fails to deliver a Response to Indemnitee by the expiration of the
Response Period, then Indemnitor shall be deemed to have waived its right to
dispute such Claim and such Claim, and the amount of Damages asserted therein,
shall be deemed to be a "Final Determination" for purposes of Section 10.8,
and the amount of Damages asserted in such Claim shall be
distributed, released or paid in accordance with Section 10.8.

  



  

10.4.   _Third-Party Claims_.

  



  

(a)  An Indemnitee shall promptly give written notice to the
Indemnitor of the assertion, whether orally or in writing, of a claim,
demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding
brought by a third party against any Indemnitee which may give rise to a
claim for indemnification against Indemnitor under this _Article X_ (in each
such case, a " _Third-Party Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that so long
as such notice of a Third-Party Claim is given on or prior to the close of
business on the last day of the survival period applicable to such Third-Party
Claim pursuant to Section 10.6, then the failure to give such notice of a
Third-Party Claim as provided for in this Section 10.4(a) shall not limit or
reduce the Indemnitee's right to indemnity hereunder or relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, unless (and then only to the extent
that) the Indemnitor is actually materially prejudiced thereby or otherwise
forfeits material rights (including the rights set forth in Section 10.4(b))
or defenses by reason of such failure.

(b)  If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee, the
Indemnitor will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it
so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnitor and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, so long as the
Indemnitor notifies Indemnitee in writing within thirty (30) days of the date
Indemnitee provided Indemnitor with notice of the Third-Party Claim (the "
_Assumption Period_ "), that Indemnitor has assumed the defense of
such Third-Party Claim (the " _Assumption Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_
that neither the Stockholder Representative nor any Company Securityholder
will have the right (as the Indemnitor) to assume control of the defense of a
Third-Party Claim: (A) if such Third-Party Claim involves a criminal
Proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation relating to any
Amtrol Company, (B) if such Third-Party Claim constitutes a claim for
nonmonetary, equitable or injunctive relief against any Amtrol Company or (C)
in the case where the Company Securityholders are the Indemnitor and the
Third-Party Claim and the Damages asserted thereunder involve an amount that
exceeds the amount then available in the Indemnification Escrow Account
for the satisfaction of such Damages by more than $250,000. Should an
Indemnitor so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnitor will not be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred after the date of the Assumption Notice by the
Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes
such defense, the Indemnitee will have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood, however, that the
Indemnitor will control such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitor will pay for one separate counsel for Indemnitee if (x) the
Indemnitor authorizes separate counsel in connection with the defense of such
Third-Party Claim or (y) the Indemnitee's outside counsel has advised the
Indemnitee in writing that there is a conflict of interest that would make
common counsel inappropriate under the applicable standards of
professional conduct. The Indemnitor will be liable for the reasonable and
documented out of pocket fees and expenses of counsel employed by the
Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the
defense thereof, if the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder,
and Indemnitee may also make any filings, including any motions, as may be
necessary to preserve the parties' positions and rights with respect to such
Third-Party Claim during such period. If the Indemnitor fails to provide an
Assumption Notice by the expiration of the Assumption Period, then the
Indemnitee will have the right to undertake the defense of such Third-Party
Claim at the expense and for the account of the Indemnitor.

  



  

(c)  The parties hereto will act in good faith in responding
to, defending against, settling or otherwise proceeding with any Third-Party
Claim, and will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such
Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation will include the retention where
reasonably practicable and (upon the defending party's request) the provision
of records and information in such party's possession and control which are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees and other
representatives and advisors available (at the defending party's cost and
expense) on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder; _provided_ that no party will be required to
provide any documents or other information covered by attorney-
client privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine or similar protection.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the party controlling the
defense of any Third-Party Claim shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
the other party, upon request, copies of all correspondence, pleadings,
motions, briefs, appeals or other written statements relating to or submitted
in connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim, and timely notices
of, and the right to participate (as an observer) in any hearing or
other court proceeding, meeting or negotiation relating to the Third-Party
Claim.

  



  

   

86 
--- 

 



    

(d)  If the Indemnitee conducts the defense of a Third-Party
Claim pursuant to this Section 10.4, such Indemnitee will not admit any
Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(e)  In all events the insurer or insurers under the RandW Policy
and their agents, representatives and advisors shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of any matter which might reasonably constitute a
Loss (as defined in the RandW Policy) to the fullest extent provided in the RandW
Policy.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this _Article X_ to the
contrary, the provisions of this Section 10.4 shall not apply with respect to
any Tax Claim governed by Section 7.4(f).

  



  

10.5.   _Contents of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim by an
Indemnitee given pursuant to Section 10.3 shall contain the following
information:

  



  

(a)  that Indemnitee has incurred or paid or, in good faith,
believes Indemnitee may have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated
amount arising from such Claim; and

  



  

(b)  a description, in reasonable detail, of the facts,
circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged Damages, including the
identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent known and
reasonably available to Indemnitee). Simultaneous with delivery of the Notice
of Claim (or at the same time if the Indemnitee so elects) the Indemnitee
shall deliver copies of any demand or complaint covered by clause (a) of this
Section 10.5, the amount of Damages (or a reasonable, good faith estimate
thereof), the date each such item was or is expected to be incurred or paid,
or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the specific nature of the
breach or potential breach to which such item is related; in each case, to the
extent known and reasonably available to Indemnitee.

  



  

10.6.   _Survival of Representations and Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. All representations and warranties of each party hereto
contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and
effect and shall survive the Closing until the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date (the " _Standard Survival Termination Date_ ").
All other covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement, including those requiring performance from and after the Closing,
shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect until
the date that they expire in accordance with their respective terms.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at
or prior to close of business on the last day a claim for indemnification may
be asserted by either a Purchaser Indemnified Person or a Company
Indemnified Person under this _Article X_ , an Indemnifying Party has been
notified in writing of a claim for indemnification in accordance with the
terms of this _Article X_ and such claim has not been finally resolved or
disposed of as of such date, such claim for indemnification shall continue to
survive such expiration date and shall remain a basis for indemnification
hereunder until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance
with the terms hereof.

10.7.   _Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a)  Except as may be required to specifically enforce post-
closing covenants hereunder pursuant to Section 11.12, after the Closing Date
the indemnification rights set forth in this _Article X_ and in Section 7.4(k)
are and shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Purchaser, Purchaser
Indemnified Persons, the Company Indemnified Persons, the Company
Securityholders, the Stockholder Representative and the Company with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained
in this Agreement is intended to limit (and it shall not limit) the liability
of any Person or otherwise limit or restrict the assertion of claims for
intentional fraud under Delaware common law (" _Fraud_ ").

  



  

(b)  The provisions of _Article X_ and in Section 7.4(k) were
specifically bargained for among the parties hereto and were taken into
account by the parties hereto in agreeing upon the amount of the Merger
Consideration and the adjustments thereto and are reflected in the amounts
payable to the Company Securityholders in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  



  

10.8.   _Indemnification Payments; Indemnity Escrow Release_.

  



  

(a)  Within five (5) Business Days after a Final Determination
(as defined below), Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions signed by both
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative (attaching a copy of such Final
Determination) instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse all or a portion of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount (to the extent there are funds remaining in
the Indemnification Escrow Account and only up to the amount of such remaining
funds) in accordance with such Final Determination, as contemplated by
Section 4 of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b)  On the first Business Day following the Standard Survival
Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall release from the
Indemnification Escrow Account an amount equal to the sum of: (i) the amount
remaining in Indemnification Escrow Account _minus_ (ii) the aggregate
amount, if any, of (A) all Third Party Claims asserted against any Purchaser
Indemnified Persons and (B) all Claims for indemnification under Section
10.1, in each case properly asserted as of the Standard Survival Termination
Date by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons in accordance with this _Article X_
, but not yet subject to a Final Determination (as defined below) as of the
Standard Survival Termination Date (the " _Unresolved Claims_ "), to the
Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds for deposit into
the Payment Fund and distribution to the applicable Company Securityholders
in accordance with Section 2.4 and the written instructions of the
Stockholder Representative.

  



  

   

88 
--- 

 



    

(c)  The amounts retained in the Indemnification Escrow Account
in respect of any Unresolved Claim shall be released by the Escrow Agent upon
a Final Determination (as defined below) of any Unresolved Claim in respect of
which such amounts had been retained in accordance with the terms of such
Final Determination and the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d)  For purposes of this Section 10.8, a " _Final
Determination_ " shall exist when (i) the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee have
entered into a written joint instruction or settlement agreement with respect
to the subject matter of a Claim or a Third-Party Claim, as the case may be,
(ii) a "Final Determination" has been deemed to have occurred pursuant to
Section 10.3(c) or (iii) a final non-appealable order has been entered by a
court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the subject matter of a Claim
or a Third-Party Claim.

  



  

10.9.   _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The parties hereto
and the Company Securityholders agree to treat any indemnification payment
made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

11.3.   _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process;
Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a)  The parties hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the State of
Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action
proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The
parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

  



  

(b)  Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being
served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by
delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6.

  



  

(c)  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT
BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT
(WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION
ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY
PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 11.3
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE
WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  



  

11.4.   _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement
(including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. Prior
to the Closing, this Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and
any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument making
specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought (which, in the case of the Company, shall require the prior approval
of its Board of Directors). After the Closing, this Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative, on the other
hand. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without
limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

11.5.   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the conflicts or choice of law provisions thereof or of any other
jurisdiction that would give rise to the application of the domestic
substantive law of any other jurisdiction.

  



  

11.6.   _Notices_. All notices, waivers and other communications under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when
delivered personally by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when

11.7.   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or
public policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

   

92 
--- 

 



    

11.8.   _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third-party beneficiary rights or remedies in any Person not a
party to this Agreement, except for the DandO Indemnified Persons as
contemplated by Section 7.2, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and the
Company Indemnified Persons as contemplated in _Article X_ , each of whom
are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. In addition, Locke
Lord LLP shall be entitled to rely upon the waivers set forth in Section
11.11. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by either the Company or Purchaser, without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment
without the required consents shall be void, except that Purchaser may assign
its rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement to one or more
Affiliates of Purchaser. No assignment of any obligations hereunder shall
relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted
assignment, the references in this Agreement to such assignor shall also apply
to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

  



  

11.9.   _No Recourse_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section
11.9, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of
action arising out of this Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons
who are identified herein as parties hereto and the Company Securityholders,
in each case solely to the extent of each such Person's express
obligations hereunder and subject to the limitations set forth herein, and no
former, current or future Affiliate of any Company Securityholder or of any
of the parties hereto, and no former, current or future director, officer,
employee, agent, representative, general or limited partner, manager, member,
equityholder or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Related Parties_ ") shall have any liability solely as a result of holding
such position or relationship, whether by the enforcement of any assessment
or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute,
regulation or other applicable Law, for any obligations or liabilities of a
party hereto for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith, and no party hereto and their respective Affiliates shall have any
rights of recovery in respect hereof against any Related Party and no personal
liability shall attach to any Related Party through any Company
Securityholder or the Stockholder Representative or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by the enforcement of any
judgment, fine or penalty or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable Law, or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, in no event shall any Company Securityholder or any party hereto
be deemed a Related Party for purposes of this Section 11.9. Notwithstanding
the generality of the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 11.9 shall (i) limit the obligations of, or recourse against,
any Person under this Agreement, or any other agreement, document or
instrument, in each case to which it is a direct party or is otherwise bound
with respect to such Person's obligations hereunder or thereunder (subject to
applicable limitations as set forth herein and therein), including, without
limitation, the obligations of any Company Stockholder under any Letter of
Transmittal or of any Company Optionholder under any option agreement or
Option Termination Agreement, in each case, including the acknowledgement
and agreement of such Person thereunder to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, or (ii) limit or preclude any claim for Fraud.

11.10.   _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that one of the parties hereto does not perform its
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise breaches such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that so long as
this Agreement remains in effect, the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at
law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

  



  

11.11.   _Retention of Counsel_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under
or in connection with this Agreement following the Closing, the Stockholder
Representative and the Company Securityholders shall have the right, at their
election, to retain Locke Lord LLP to represent them in such matter, even if
such representation shall be adverse to Purchaser and/or the Amtrol
Companies. Purchaser and the Amtrol Companies, for themselves and for their
respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably consent to
any such representation in any such matter. Purchaser and the Amtrol
Companies, for themselves and for their respective Affiliates, successors and
assigns, hereby irrevocably waive any actual or potential conflict arising
from any such representation in the event of: (1) any adversity between the
interests of Company and the Company Securityholders on the one hand and
Purchaser and the Amtrol Companies on the other hand, in any such matter;
and/or (2) any communication between Locke Lord LLP and any Amtrol Company,
its Affiliates or employees, whether privileged or not, or any other
information known to such counsel, by reason of such counsel's representation
of any of the Amtrol Companies prior to Closing.

  



  

11.12.   _Protected Communications_. The parties to this Agreement agree
that, immediately prior to the Closing, without the need for any further
action (a) all right, title and interest of any Amtrol Company in and to all
Protected Communications shall thereupon transfer to and be vested solely in
the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Company
Securityholders), and (b) any and all protections from disclosure, including,
but not limited to, attorney-client privileges and work product protections,
associated with or arising from any Protected Communications that would have
been exercisable by any Amtrol Company shall thereupon be vested exclusively
in the Stockholder Representative and shall be exercised or waived solely as
directed by the Stockholder Representative. None of the Amtrol Companies,
Purchaser or any Person acting on any of their behalf shall, without the
prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, assert or waive or
attempt to assert or waive any such protection against disclosure, including,
but not limited to, the attorney-client privilege or work product protection,
or to discover, obtain, use or disclose or attempt to discover, obtain, use
or disclose any Protected Communications in any manner, including in
connection with any dispute or legal proceeding relating to or in connection
with this Agreement, the events and negotiations leading to this Agreement,
or any of the transactions contemplated herein, _provided_ , _however_ , the
foregoing shall neither prohibit Purchaser from seeking proper discovery of
such documents nor the Stockholder Representative or the Company
Securityholders from asserting that such documents are not discoverable to
the extent that applicable attorney-client privileges and work product
protections have attached thereto. The Stockholder Representative shall have
the right (subject to applicable Law and Order and the requirements of any
Legal Proceeding) at any time prior to or following the Closing to remove,
erase, delete, disable, copy or otherwise deal with any Protected
Communications in whatever way the Stockholder Representative desires, and the

parties hereto understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, shall be
deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege or other
protection from disclosure or use. Each of the parties understands and agrees
that it has undertaken reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of
Protected Communications as well as confidential and proprietary information

a claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure will not
constitute a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality,
privilege, or protection from disclosure, including, but not limited to, with
respect to information involving or concerning the same subject matter as the
disclosed information. The parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to
return any inadvertently disclosed information to the disclosing party
promptly upon becoming aware of the existence of the inadvertently disclosed
information. The parties further agree that promptly after the return of any
inadvertently disclosed information, the party returning such inadvertently
disclosed information shall destroy any and all copies, summaries,

including electronic versions thereof, and all portions of larger documents or
communications that contain such copies, summaries, descriptions or notes.
