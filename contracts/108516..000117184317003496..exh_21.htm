agree, all communications between Purchaser and the Stockholder Representative or any of their respective representatives, on the

effective as of the date the Independent Accountants&rsquo; written determination is received by Purchaser and the Stockholder

the Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, as follows: a portion of the Accounting Fees equal to the product of the Accounting
Fees and a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar amount of the Disputed Items resolved by the Independent Accountants
in favor of Purchaser and the denominator of which is the aggregate dollar amount of all Disputed Items submitted to the Independent
Accountants for resolution, shall be allocated to the Stockholder Representative, and the remainder shall be allocated to Purchaser

Except as set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;4.10</U>, all Intellectual Property is owned solely by the Amtrol Companies, free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company have all rights to use the Intellectual

absolute discretion of the Stockholder Representative; and in general to do all things and to perform all acts including, without
limitation, executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices
or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with the Escrow Agreement. This power of attorney and all authority
hereby conferred is coupled with an interest and is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of
any Company Securityholder, by operation of law, whether by such Company Securityholder&rsquo;s death, disability, protective supervision
or any other event. Without limiting the foregoing, this power of attorney is to ensure the performance of a special obligation
and, accordingly, by approval of the Merger, by executing and delivering the applicable Letter of Transmittal or by executing and
delivering an Option Termination Agreement, each Company Securityholder shall be deemed to have waived and renounced such Company
Securityholder&rsquo;s right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally at any time. By approval of the Merger, by executing
and delivering the applicable Letter of Transmittal or by executing and delivering an Option Termination Agreement, each Company
Securityholder shall be deemed to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action
of the Stockholder Representative taken under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power of attorney granted
in this <U>Article V</U>, no agreement, instrument, acknowledgement or other act or document shall be ineffective solely by reason
of a Company Securityholder (instead of the Stockholder Representative) having signed or given the same directly.</P>

the Company has not then obtained recovery or reimbursement; <U>provided</U> that the Company Securityholders will not be entitled
to any refunds attributable to carrybacks from periods ending after the Closing Date, or refunds that were reflected as assets
in the Closing Statement (including any estimated and pre-paid Tax payments). If Purchaser or the Company receives any refund of
Tax to which the Company Securityholders are entitled pursuant to this Section 7.4(g), Purchaser will pay (or cause the Company
to pay) such refund of Tax (including any interest received thereon) to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section 3.10(d)(iii),
<U>provided</U> that, for the avoidance of doubt, no amount of such tax refund shall be paid by Purchaser until after the Adjustment
Escrow Release Date. In the event that Purchaser or the Company is required to repay all or any portion of such refund of Tax (including
any interest received thereon) to the relevant Taxing Authority, the Stockholder Representative shall, at the expense of the Company
Securityholders, at the request of Purchaser, repay to Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, the amount paid over pursuant to
this Section 7.4(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Taxing Authority) within five (5) Business
Days of such request. In applying this Section&nbsp;7.4(g), any refund of Taxes (including any interest thereon) for a Straddle
Period will be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
Date in accordance with the principles of Section 7.4(b). Purchaser shall be entitled to all refunds relating to any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (including, without limitation, any refund that is attributable to any net
operating loss carryforward of the Company arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or any tax credits or other tax attributes of the
Company carried forward from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date);
<U>provided</U> that, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall make Transaction Tax Benefit Payments to the Stockholder Representative
(for distribution to the Company Securityholders in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.4) in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.4(c).</P>

the case may be, for Damages pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section&nbsp;10.2 of this Agreement (such Person making a Claim, an &ldquo;<U>Indemnitee</U>&rdquo;).
As used herein, the term &ldquo;<U>Indemnitor</U>&rdquo; means a party against whom a Claim is asserted under this <U>Article X</U>.
An Indemnitee seeking indemnification for a Claim shall give the Indemnitor written notice of such Claim (a &ldquo;<U>Notice of

nor any Company Securityholder will have the right (as the Indemnitor) to assume control of the defense of a Third-Party Claim:
(A)&nbsp;if such Third-Party Claim involves a criminal Proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation relating to
any Amtrol Company, (B)&nbsp;if such Third-Party Claim constitutes a claim for nonmonetary, equitable or injunctive relief against

Damages asserted thereunder involve an amount that exceeds the amount then available in the Indemnification Escrow Account for
the satisfaction of such Damages by more than $250,000. Should an Indemnitor so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnitor will not be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses subsequently incurred after the date of the Assumption Notice
by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee will have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnitor, it being understood, however, that the Indemnitor will control such defense; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that

the Indemnitee for any period during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof, if the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, and Indemnitee may also make any filings, including any motions, as may be necessary to preserve the

</FONT><U>Remedies</U>. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that one of the parties hereto does not perform
its obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breaches such
provisions. It is accordingly agreed that so long as this Agreement remains in effect, the parties hereto shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity.</P>

the Stockholder Representative. None of the Amtrol Companies, Purchaser or any Person acting on any of their behalf shall, without
the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative, assert or waive or attempt to assert or waive any such protection
against disclosure, including, but not limited to, the attorney-client privilege or work product protection, or to discover, obtain,

Purchaser from seeking proper discovery of such documents nor the Stockholder Representative or the Company Securityholders from
asserting that such documents are not discoverable to the extent that applicable attorney-client privileges and work product protections
have attached thereto. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right (subject to applicable Law and Order and the requirements
of any Legal Proceeding) at any time prior to or following the Closing to remove, erase, delete, disable, copy or otherwise deal
with any Protected Communications in whatever way the Stockholder Representative desires, and the Amtrol Companies and Purchaser
shall, upon the Stockholder Representative&rsquo;s written request, provide full access to all Protected Communications in their
possession or within their direct or indirect control and reasonable assistance at the expense of the Person requesting such assistance
in order to give full force and effect to the rights of the Stockholder Representative hereunder.</P>

this Agreement, shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege or other protection from disclosure

Communications as well as confidential and proprietary information of the Amtrol Companies. Notwithstanding those efforts, the

disclosure. The parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of information that may be confidential, subject to a
claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure will not constitute a waiver of or otherwise prejudice any claim of
confidentiality, privilege, or protection from disclosure, including, but not limited to, with respect to information involving
or concerning the same subject matter as the disclosed information. The parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to return
any inadvertently disclosed information to the disclosing party promptly upon becoming aware of the existence of the inadvertently
disclosed information. The parties further agree that promptly after the return of any inadvertently disclosed information, the
party returning such inadvertently disclosed information shall destroy any and all copies, summaries, descriptions and/or notes
