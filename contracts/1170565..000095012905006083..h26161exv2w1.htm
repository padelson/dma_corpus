Affiliates and successors shall, without the consent of Purchaser, directly or indirectly, design,
develop, market, produce, manufacture, rent, sell or provide any product, good or service that

currently, or has been within the three years prior to the Closing Date, conducting the Business,
except for the benefit of Purchaser and its Affiliates, or assist any Person to do the same, it
being acknowledged that the areas set out above are separate and distinct covenants, severable one

unreasonable, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, in which case such
area shall not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;5.16, (a)&nbsp;Seller

Seller acknowledges that a remedy at law for any breach or attempted breach of this Section&nbsp;5.16
will be inadequate and further agrees that any breach of this Section&nbsp;5.16 will result in
irreparable harm to Purchaser and the Business and, in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to Purchaser (including without limitation, recovery of the monetary consideration, if
any, described in this Section&nbsp;5.16), Purchaser shall be entitled to specific performance and
injunctive and other equitable relief in case of any such breach or attempted breach. Seller
acknowledges that this covenant not to compete is being provided as an inducement to Purchaser to
enter into and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that this Section
5.16 contains reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be
restrained that do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill of the
Business. Whenever possible, each provision of this Section&nbsp;5.16 shall be interpreted in such a
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law but if any provision of this Section&nbsp;5.16
shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, then such provision shall be ineffective to
the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Section&nbsp;5.16. If any provision of this Section&nbsp;5.16 shall, for any reason, be judged by any court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such judgment shall not affect,
impair or invalidate the remainder of this Section&nbsp;5.16 but shall be confined in its operation to
the provision of this Section&nbsp;5.16 directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment
shall have been rendered. In the event that the provisions of this Section&nbsp;5.16 should ever be
deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations permitted by applicable law, such provision
shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations permitted by applicable law.
Purchaser acknowledges that neither direct nor indirect ownership by Seller of one percent or
less of the outstanding common shares of any publicly traded corporation, partnership or trust
shall constitute a breach of this Section&nbsp;5.16.

or based upon the matters described in Section&nbsp;5.11, Section&nbsp;5.12 and <U>Schedule&nbsp;5.12</U> of the

notwithstanding that claims in respect of such indebtedness, liabilities or obligations arose, or
claims in respect thereof were made, after the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(m)&nbsp;&#147;<U>Subsidiary</U>&#148; when used with respect to any party means any corporation or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which such party directly or indirectly
owns or controls at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such corporation or other organization, or any organization of which such
party is a general partner.

in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">hereunder. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.11 SEVERABILITY .</B>
Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.12 ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT; LIMITATION ON DAMAGES .</B>
The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof in any court in Alberta, Canada, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE IN
RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.13 OBLIGATION OF SUBSIDIARIES .</B>
Whenever this Agreement requires any of the Subsidiaries of Purchaser or Seller (or their
respective successors) to take any action prior to the Closing, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of each of Purchaser or Seller, respectively, to cause such
action to be taken and a guarantee of the performance thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.14 SURVIVAL .</B> The representations
and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing. Except to
the extent set forth herein, all of the covenants of the parties to this Agreement shall survive
the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect indefinitely. To the extent that the
survival period for the covenants provided herein exceeds a limitation period provided by the
Limitations Act (Alberta), this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an agreement within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;7 of the Limitations Acts (Alberta) expressly providing for the extension of a
limitation period provided by the Limitations Act (Alberta).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Section&nbsp;8.15 EXTENSION; WAIVER .</B> At any
time prior to the Closing, each party may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)&nbsp;extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b)&nbsp;waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c)&nbsp;waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party.
