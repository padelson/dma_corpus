transportation imbalances existing as of the Effective Time at the then
current contract amount applicable to under-deliveries or over-deliveries to
the pipeline.

(w) with respect to any Lease, Well or section, any defects affecting any
depths other than the depths specified for any Lease, Well or section, as set
forth on _Exhibits A, B or C_ , as applicable.

 

4.3 _Title Defect_. The term "Title Defect" means, with respect to an
Asset, any lien, charge, encumbrance, obligation, encroachment, irregularity,
defect in (including a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest, Working Interest,
Net Acres or Net Revenue Acres) or objection to real property title of Seller,
that alone or in combination with other defects renders title to such Asset
less than Defensible Title.

4.4 _Notices of Title Defect and Title Defect Value_.

(a) Prior to the Title Defect Notice Deadline, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller written notices (each, a "Notice of Title Defect") setting forth
each Title Defect affecting the Assets that Buyer believes in good faith to be
a Non-De Minimus Title Defect. With 

 



22  respect to each such Non-De Minimus Title Defect, the Notice of Title Defect
shall (i) describe such Title Defect, (ii) include documentation
or information supporting the existence such Title Defect, (iii) if such
Title Defect is curable, describe in general terms the curative action that
Buyer reasonably anticipates would need to be taken in order to cure such
Title Defect, and (iv) describe Buyers good faith estimate of the Title
Defect Value and associated calculations and documentation. Buyer shall have
the right at any time prior to the Title Defect Notice Deadline to, by
delivery of a written notice to Seller, extend the date of the Title Defect
Notice Deadline to 5:00 p.m. local time in Houston, Texas on the date that is
90 days after the Execution Date. From and after any such extension the term
"Title Defect Notice Deadline", as used in this Agreement, shall refer to
5:00 p.m. local time in Houston, Texas on the date that is 90 days after the
Execution Date. Without limitation of Buyers rights pursuant to the special
warranty of title contained in the Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance,
Buyer shall be deemed to have conclusively waived (A) any Title Defect about
which it has knowledge of and fails to notify Seller in writing prior to the
Title Defect Notice Deadline, and (B) any Title Defect with respect to which
the Title Defect Value is less than or equal to the Title Defect Minimum.

 

(b) "Title Defect Value" shall mean and be determined as follows:

 

(i) If the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance on the Asset, the Title
Defect Value shall be the cost of unconditionally removing such lien or
encumbrance, not to exceed the Allocated Value of the affected Asset.

 

(ii) If the Title Defect results from any matter not described in
Subsection (i), the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the
difference between the value of the Asset affected by such Title Defect
burdened by such Title Defect, and the value of such Asset not burdened by
such Title Defect (i.e. the Allocated Value of such Asset), taking into
consideration the nature of such Title Defect, the likelihood that such Title
Defect may actually result in a claim against or loss of title and such other
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 

(iii) If a Title Defect affects a Lease that covers Lands that contribute
to a Well and Lands that contribute to a Lease, the Title Defect shall be
allocated independently to such Well to the extent it affects the Value of
such Well and to such Lease to the extent it affects the Value of such Lease;
such that there will be one Title Defect Value attributable to the Well and
one Title Defect Value attributable to the Lease.

(iv) The Title Defect Value for an Asset, together with the aggregate
Title Defect Values attributable to any other Title Defects affecting such
Asset, shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Asset.

 



23 4.5 _Title Defect Adjustments_. The Parties shall proceed as follows with
respect to any Notice of Title Defect:

(a) Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to
cure to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer, on or before the applicable
Title Curative Date, any curable Non-De Minimus Title Defect affecting the
Assets that is timely identified in the Notice of Title Defect under
_Section_ __ _ 4.4_ by providing Buyer written notice of such election no
later than 7 days after the Title Defect Notice Deadline (the "Cure Election
Notice Deadline"). At Closing, the Title Defect Value of any such Non-De
Minimus Title Defect that is not cured to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer
by Closing (and for which the Title Curative Date has not yet passed), shall
be deposited into an escrow account (the "Defect Escrow Account"), pursuant
to an escrow agreement, the form of which is mutually acceptable to the
Parties, to be executed by the Parties at Closing pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
12.2(k)_ herein, and established with a mutually agreeable escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent") and shall be deducted in the calculation of the Closing
Amount. On each Title Curative Date, (i) if the applicable Non-De Minimus
Title Defect is cured by Seller to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer,
Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse the associated Title Defect Value (and any interest
and earnings thereon) to Seller and (ii) if the applicable Non-De Minimus
Title Defect is not cured by Seller to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer
and (x) the Title Defect Deductible has been satisfied as of such date,
Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse the associated Title Defect Value (and any interest
and earnings thereon) to Buyer and (y) the Title Defect Deductible has not
been satisfied as of such date, Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse the associated
Title Defect Value (and any interest and earnings thereon) to Seller to the
extent such disbursement does not result in satisfaction of the Title Defect
Deductible.

 

(b) With respect to each Non-De Minimus Title Defect affecting an Asset
identified in the Notice of Title Defect that Seller has not elected to cure
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.5(a)_ (or Seller has elected to cure pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.5(a)_ but the Title Curative Date applicable to such Non-De
Minimus Title Defect has passed), the Parties shall, no later than 7 days
after the Cure Election Notice Deadline, attempt in good faith to reach
agreement on the existence of such Title Defect and the Title Defect Value.
In the event that the Parties do not reach such an agreement by the date that
is 7 days after the Cure Election Notice Deadline, then:

 

(i) Seller and Buyer shall each have the option to submit the existence of
such Non-De Minimus Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Value to binding
determination by the Title Expert pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.7_;

 

(ii) Seller and Buyer may mutually agree to exclude the affected Asset from
the Assets being sold to Buyer under this Agreement, in which event the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset and such
Asset shall thereafter be treated as an Excluded Asset; or

 



24 (iii) Seller and Buyer may mutually agree that Seller shall indemnify,
defend, save, and hold harmless Buyer under _Section_ __ _ 14.3(a)(vii)_
(subject to the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)(iii)_ and
_Article 14_ ) for all Claims and Losses arising out of, attributable to, or
in connection with such Title Defect (an "Indemnified Title Defect"), subject
to the following:

 

(A) The amount of any Loss or Claim arising out of, attributable to, or in
connection with each Indemnified Title Defect must exceed the Title Defect
Minimum before Seller shall have any Liability or obligation under this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)(iii)_ (or _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)(viii)_) with respect
to such Loss or Claim.

(B) The aggregate Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims arising out
of, attributable to, or in connection with all Indemnified Title Defects
shall not exceed the difference of: (1) the aggregate sum of the Title Defect
Values assigned to Non-De Minimus Title Defects by Buyer in its Notices of
Title Defect; minus (2) the Title Defect Deductible.

(C) The aggregate Liability of Seller for all Losses and Claims arising
out of, attributable to, or in connection with any particular Indemnified
Title Defect shall not exceed the Title Defect Value assigned thereto by Buyer
in its Notice of Title Defect for such Indemnified Title Defect.

At Closing, the Title Defect Value of any Non-De Minimus Title Defect that is
submitted for dispute pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)(i)_ shall be
deposited into the Defect Escrow Account and shall be deducted in the
calculation of the Closing Amount. On the date that the dispute relating to
such Non-De Minimus Title Defect is resolved pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.7_,
Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse the associated Title Defect Value (and any interest
and earnings thereon) in accordance with the decision of the Title Expert (for
the avoidance of doubt, if the Title Defect Deductible has not been satisfied
at the time of such disbursement, the Title Defect Value shall be disbursed
to Seller until satisfaction of the Title Defect Deductible).

4.6 _Interest Additions_.

(a) If either Party discovers any additional interest (each, an
"Interest Addition") that is not listed in _Exhibits A, B or C_ (including,
for example, any interest that entitles Seller to receive more than the NRI
set forth in _Exhibits A, B or C_ without a corresponding increase in the WI;
that obligates Seller to bear costs and expenses in an amount less than the
WI set forth in _Exhibits A, B or C_ without a corresponding reduction in the
NRI; or that increases Sellers WI set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A, B or C_
with a corresponding increase in the NRI) and such Interest Addition is a Non-
De Minimus Interest Addition, the Party who discovers the Non-De Minimus
Interest Addition shall promptly notify the other Party of such Non-De
Minimus Interest Addition. There shall be no increase to the Base Purchase
Price as a result of Non-De Minimus Interest Additions; however, the
aggregate amount of the value of Non-De Minimus Interest Additions that exceed
the Interest Addition Deductible shall, to the extent such aggregate amount
exceeds the Interest Addition Deductible, be offset against the aggregate
amount of all Title Defect Values as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.8_. The
Party who discovers a Non-De Minimus Interest Addition, shall give the other
Party written notice of the Non-De Minimus

 



25  Interest Addition as soon as possible, but in no event later than the Title
Defect Notice Deadline. Such notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a description of each Non-De Minimus Interest Addition (and the depths to
which such Non-De Minimus Interest Addition applies), (ii) documentation or
information supporting the existence of such Non-De Minimus Interest
Addition, (iii) the Allocated Value of the Asset affected by the Non-De
Minimus Interest Addition (taking into account the depths for which such Non-
De Minimus Interest Addition applies), and (iv) the applicable Partys good
faith estimate of the value of the Non-De Minimus Interest Addition and
associated calculations and documentation (taking into account the depths for
which such Non-De Minimus Interest Addition applies). The Parties shall, no
later than the date of the Cure Election Notice Deadline, attempt in good
faith to reach agreement on the existence of such Non-De Minimus Interest
Addition and the value of such Non-De Minimus Interest Addition. In the event
the Parties cannot agree on the existence and/or value of the Non-De Minimus
Interest Addition, the disagreement shall be submitted to binding
determination by the Title Expert pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_.

(b) _Post-Closing Non-Asset Interest Additions_. Following Closing, if
either Party discovers additional leases, wells or undeveloped land of which
Defensible Title ownership is held by Seller, as of Closing, within the area
described as the "Sale Area" in Section 4.6(b) of the Disclosure Schedule,
but that are not included in the Assets as defined herein ("Post-Closing Non-
Asset Interest Addition"), the Parties agree that for a period of twenty-four
(24) months following Closing, Buyer shall have the exclusive right to
purchase any Post-Closing Non-Asset Interest Addition discovered, at a
purchase price to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. If the Parties are
unable to agree upon a purchase price for any Post-Closing Non-Asset Interest
Additions identified under this paragraph within thirty (30) days after such
interest is identified, then Buyers right under this paragraph shall
terminate and Seller shall have no further obligation to Buyer concerning such
interest. For clarity, Buyers exclusive right to purchase any Post-Closing
Non-Asset Interest Additions shall not apply to leases, wells or undeveloped
land of which Defensible Title ownership is not held by Seller at Closing and
Buyers exclusive right to purchase any such interests shall terminate on the
twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date, except for any such
interests identified by either Party prior to such date.

 

4.7 _Expert Determination of Title Defects, Title Defect Values and
Interest Additions_. If, pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)(i),_ the
existence of a Non-De Minimus Title Defect or the Title Defect Value thereof
is submitted to arbitration, or if pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.6_, the
existence or value of an Non-De Minimus Interest Addition is submitted to
arbitration, then the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 4.7_.

(a) The arbitration shall be conducted before a single Person (the "Title
Expert"). The Title Expert shall be neutral, not an affiliate, employee or
consultant of either Party and shall be an attorney with at least 10 years of
experience who practices oil and gas law or mineral law in the State of
Texas.

(b) The Parties shall mutually agree on the Title Expert; _provided_
if the Parties are not able to mutually agree on the arbiter within 5
Business Days after the matter is submitted to arbitration, the Title Expert
shall be selected by the Dallas, Texas office of the American Arbitration
Association (or in the event that there is no such office in Dallas, Texas at
such time, by any other office of the American Arbitration Association) and
such arbitration shall take place in Midland, Texas.

 



26 (c) Within 10 Business Days of the selection of the Title Expert, the
Parties shall provide to the Title Expert the following materials:

(i) if the arbitration is with respect to a disagreement under _Section_
__ _ 4.5(b),_ Buyers Notice of Title Defect and all documentation provided
therewith shall be provided to the Title Expert (and Buyer shall be allowed
to supplement such Notice of Title Defect with additional documentation or
information supporting the existence of such Title Defect and/or Sellers good
faith estimate of the Title Defect Value), and Seller shall provide such
evidence and documentation as Seller deems appropriate to dispute Buyers
assertion of the existence of the Non-De Minimus Title Defect or the Title
Defect Value as assigned thereto by Buyer in the Notice of Title Defect,
together with Sellers good faith estimate of the Title Defect Value, if any;

(ii) if the arbitration is with respect to a disagreement under _Section_
__ _ 4.6_, the notice provided by Seller shall be provided to the Title
Expert together with all documentation provided therewith, and Buyer shall
provide such evidence and documentation as it deems appropriate to dispute
the existence and/or value of the Non-De Minimus Interest Addition, together
with Buyers good faith estimate of the value of the Non-De Minimus Interest
Addition, if any;

(iii) _Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6_ and _4.7_ of this
Agreement, and the applicable portion of _Exhibits A, B, C and D_ to this
Agreement, together with any definitions of terms used in such Sections and
Exhibits, but no other provisions of this Agreement; and

(iv) Any other additional information requested by the Title Expert.

 

(d) The Title Expert shall make his determination and provide to the
Parties written findings within 15 Business Days after he has received the
materials under _Section_ __ _ 4.7(c)_. The decision of the Title Expert
shall be final and non-appealable and shall be limited to awarding
only Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to the Title Defect,
Title Defect Value or Interest Addition (or a position in between Sellers
position and Buyers position). The Title Expert shall make a
separate determination with respect to each Title Defect, Title Defect Value
and Interest Addition submitted.

 

(e) Each Party shall be responsible for paying its own costs of presenting
its case to the Title Expert, and the costs of the arbiter shall be borne
one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.

 

(f) The written finding of the arbiter need only set forth the Title
Experts award with respect to each Title Defect, Title Defect Value and
Interest Addition and not the arbiters rationale for the award.

 



27 (g) The Title Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific matters disputed and shall not act as an arbitrator,
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect
to any matter.

 

(h) The Parties agree to execute such agreements as may be reasonably
requested or required by the Title Expert, including any engagement letters,
releases and indemnities consistent with this Agreement.

4.8 _Title Defect Reduction Amount_ _._ In the event (a) (i) the
aggregate amount of all Title Defect Values attributable to uncured Non-De
Minimus Title Defects as finally determined (whether by agreement or
arbitration), _less_ (ii) the amount by which the aggregate amount of all Non-
De Minimus Interest Additions exceeds the Interest Addition Deductible, in
each case, as finally determined (whether by agreement or arbitration),
_exceeds_ (b) the Title Defect Deductible, then the Base Purchase Price shall
be reduced by such excess (the "Title Defect Reduction Amount"), and such
reduction shall be reflected, to the extent determined on the date the
Preliminary Settlement Statement is delivered, on the Preliminary Settlement
Statement, and otherwise on the Final Settlement Statement.

 

4.9 _Changes in Product Prices, Spacing and Pooling and Well Events_ _._
Subject to Sellers representations, warranties and covenants made pursuant
to this Agreement, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with respect to (i)
changes in product prices and any other market factors or conditions, (ii)
Buyer not being able to take over operations of any portion of the Assets
(except as a result of Sellers failure to comply with _Section_ __ _ 8.7_ of
this Agreement), and (iii) production declines through normal depletion or
any adverse change in the production characteristics or downhole condition of
a Well or other Asset, including a Well watering out, experiencing a collapse
in the casing or sand infiltration, from and after the Effective Time (except
as a result of Sellers failure to comply with _Section_ __ _ 8.1 or 8.2_ of
this Agreement).

 

4.10 _Consents_ _._ No later than 5 Business Days after the Execution
Date, Seller shall prepare and send notices to the holders of any consents to
the assignment of the Assets (other than holders of consents that are
customarily obtained subsequent to sale, conveyance or other transfer), all of
which consents are described in  _Section_ __ _ 4.10_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, and Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all
such consents. If Buyer discovers other consents to the assignment of the
Assets (other than holders of consents that are customarily obtained
subsequent to sale, conveyance or other transfer and consents to assign that
are described in _Section_ __ _ 4.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule) during the
course of Buyers Due Diligence Review, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of
such consents and Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain
such consents prior to Closing. If after the Execution Date Seller discovers
other consents to the assignment of the Assets (other than holders of
consents that are customarily obtained subsequent to sale, conveyance or other
transfer and consents to assign that are described in _Section_ __ _ 4.10_ of
the Disclosure Schedule), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such consents
and Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such consents
prior to Closing. Except for consents that are customarily obtained subsequent
to sale, conveyance or other transfer and consents that are not Material
Consents, if a necessary consent to assign any Asset has not been obtained as
of the Closing, then (i) such Asset shall be excluded from the Assets being
sold to Buyer under this Agreement, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the Allocated Value of such Asset and such Asset shall

 



28  thereafter be treated as an Excluded Asset, (ii) Seller shall use its
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such consent as promptly as possible
following Closing, and (iii) if such consent has been obtained as of the
Final Settlement Date, the Allocated Value of such Assets shall be an upward
adjustment to the Purchase Price on the Final Settlement Statement and Seller
shall assign such Asset to Buyer, effective as of the Effective Time,
pursuant to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement. Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any required consent including
providing evidence of financial condition (but such cooperation shall not
require the payment of consideration by Buyer unless Buyer agrees).

4.11 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. No later than 5 Business Days after
the Execution Date, Seller shall prepare and send notices to the holders of
any preferential rights to purchase any part of the Assets that would be
triggered by the transfer of the Assets by Seller to Buyer, all of which
preferential rights are described in _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ of the Disclosure
Schedule. If Buyer discovers other preferential rights to purchase any part of
the Assets that would be triggered by the transfer of the Assets by Seller to
Buyer (other than preferential rights that are described in _Section_ __ _
4.11_ of the Disclosure Schedule) during the course of Buyers Due Diligence
Review, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such preferential rights and
Seller shall prepare and send notices to the holders of any such preferential
rights no later than 5 Business Days after Buyer notifies Seller of such
preferential rights. If after the Execution Date Seller discovers other
preferential rights to purchase any part of the Assets that would be triggered
by the transfer of the Assets by Seller to Buyer (other than preferential
rights that are described in _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ of the
Disclosure Schedule), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such preferential
rights and Seller shall prepare and send notices to the holders of any such
preferential rights no later than 5 Business Days after Seller notifies Buyer
of such preferential rights. If, prior to Closing, any of such Persons
asserting a preferential purchase right notifies Seller that it intends to
consummate the purchase of that portion of the Assets to which it holds a
preferential purchase right pursuant to the terms and conditions of such
notice and this Agreement, then such Assets shall be excluded from the Assets
identified in this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Values of such Assets; _provided_ that if the holder of such
preferential right fails to consummate the purchase of such Assets prior to
the Closing Date, then Seller shall notify Buyer, and Seller shall sell to
Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Assets to which the
preferential purchase right was asserted for the Allocated Values of such
Assets. All Assets for which a preferential purchase right is outstanding but
has not been asserted prior to Closing, or with respect to which closing does
not occur on or before the Closing Date following the assertion of a
preferential purchase right shall be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement. If one or more of the holders of any
preferential purchase rights validly notifies Seller subsequent to
Closing that it intends to assert its preferential purchase right, Seller
shall immediately give notice thereof to Buyer, whereupon Buyer shall perform
all valid preferential purchase right obligations of Seller to such holders
and Buyer shall be entitled to receive (and Seller hereby assigns to Buyer
all of Sellers rights to) all proceeds received from such holders in
connection with such preferential purchase rights. Buyer hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from any claim by the holder of a
preferential right with respect to the allocation of the Base Purchase Price
among the Assets, including the Asset(s) subject to such preferential right. 

 



29 4.12 _Casualty Loss_. Prior to Closing, if any material portion of an
Asset is destroyed by fire or other casualty or if a portion of an Asset is
taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent
domain ("Casualty Loss") ( _provided_ that none of the matters covered by
_Section_ __ _ 4.9_ shall constitute a Casualty Loss), at the option of Buyer
(a) such Asset shall be excluded from this Agreement and the Base Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset and such Asset
shall thereafter be treated as an Excluded Asset or (b) the Base Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the estimated cost to repair such Asset (with
equipment of similar utility), which amount shall not exceed the
Allocated Value of the Asset (the Purchase Price adjustment, whether from
excluding the Asset or agreement upon an appropriated adjustment, is herein
called the "Net Casualty Loss") and Seller shall retain all insurance proceeds
and all claims against third parties with respect to the Casualty Loss.
Seller, upon consent of Buyer, may elect to cure such Casualty Loss to the
reasonable satisfaction of Buyer. If Seller elects to cure such Casualty Loss,
Seller may replace any personal property that is the subject of a Casualty
Loss with equipment of similar grade and utility, or replace any real property
with real property of similar nature and kind if such real property is
acceptable to Buyer in its sole discretion. If Seller elects to cure the
Casualty Loss and does in fact cure the Casualty Loss to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer, the affected Asset shall be included in the Assets and
transferred to Buyer at the Closing with no adjustment to the Purchase
Price. 

ARTICLE 5

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

5.1 _Environmental Investigation_ _._

 

(a) _Environmental Reports and Personnel_. Subject to _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)_, Seller shall provide Buyer with access during the regular business
hours of Seller to all information in Sellers possession or control
pertaining to the environmental condition of the Assets, including any
environmental reports, permits, records, and assessments.

(b) _Environmental Assessment_. Buyer may, or may engage a
qualified environmental contractor to, conduct an on-site inspection,
environmental assessment, and compliance audit of the Assets (an
"Environmental Assessment") at Buyers sole risk, Liability, and expense;
_provided_ that: (i) Buyer shall provide Seller with prior written notice of
any activities conducted on-site at the Assets with respect to any such
Environmental Assessment, and shall provide Seller the opportunity to
participate in all such activities; (ii) any contractor engaged to perform all
or any portion of such Environmental Assessment shall execute and deliver to
Seller a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller;
(iii) with respect to those Assets not operated by Seller, Buyer shall have
first received the written consent of the operator of such Assets to the
extent such consent is required (and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining such written consent); and (iv) Buyer
shall not conduct, authorize, or permit any test drilling, sampling, or other
on-site activities without prior written notice to, and the prior written
consent of, Seller, which consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of
Seller (together with the prior written notice to, and prior written consent
of, the operator of those Assets not operated by Seller). In the event that
(x) Buyer, in its reasonable discretion based on the findings of Buyers
Environmental Assessment, determines that an invasive test or procedure
(including test drilling, sampling, or other on-site activities) is needed
with respect to an Asset and Buyer does not receive any necessary consents to
conduct such invasive test or procedure

 



30  or (y) Buyer is not granted access to an Asset for the purpose of conducting
its Environmental Assessment, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion exclude
the affected Asset, in which event the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the Allocated Value of such Asset and such Asset shall thereafter be
treated as an Excluded Asset. If Buyer or any of its Representatives prepares
a final report with respect to its Environmental Assessment of the Assets,
Buyer shall, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _
3.3(a)_, furnish a copy thereof to Seller.

 

5.2 _NORM and Asbestos_. Some production equipment may contain asbestos or
NORM. In this regard, the Parties expressly understand that NORM may affix or
attach itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale or in
other forms, that said wells, materials and equipment located on the Lands or
included in the Assets described herein may contain NORM and that NORM
containing material may have been buried or otherwise disposed of on the
Lands. Buyer and Seller also expressly understand that special procedures may
be required for the Remediation, removal, transportation and disposal of
asbestos or NORM from the Assets and Lands where such material may be found
and that, after Closing, Buyer assumes all liability for or in connection with
the assessment, containment, removal, Remediation, transportation and disposal
of any such materials, in accordance with all existing or future applicable
laws, rules, regulations and other requirements of any governmental or
judicial bodies having jurisdiction and also with the terms and conditions of
all applicable leases and other contracts. For purposes of this Agreement
asbestos and NORM contaminated pipe, tubing, well and other equipment and
materials that does not meet or exceed actionable levels of contamination or
does not meet the requirements for a Non-De Minimus Environmental Defect shall
not be an Environmental Defect.

 

5.3 _Notice of Environmental Defects_. Promptly upon discovery, but in any
event prior to the Environmental Defect Notice Deadline, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller written notices (each, a "Notice of Environmental Defect") setting
forth each Environmental Defect (other than those environmental matters
described in  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Disclosed
Environmental Defects")) affecting the Assets that Buyers Environmental
Assessment identifies and that Buyer believes to be a Non-De Minimus
Environmental Defect, together with a description in reasonable detail of the
Environmental Defect (and, to the extent reasonably necessary to support such
description, reports, assessments and other documentation in Buyers
possession relating to such Environmental Defect) and Buyers good faith
estimate of the cost to Remediate such Environmental Defect (the
"Environmental Defect Value"). Without limitation of Buyers remedies for any
breach by Seller of its representations and warranties in _Article VI_
pertaining to environmental matters, Buyer shall be deemed to have
conclusively waived (a) any Environmental Defect about which it fails to
notify Seller in writing pursuant to a Notice of Environmental Defect prior to
the Environmental Defect Notice Deadline and (b) the Disclosed Environmental
Defects. Buyer shall have the right to exclude an Asset from this Agreement
if Buyers good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, as set
forth in the Notice of Environmental Defect relating to such Environmental
Defect exceeds 50% of the Allocated Value of the Asset affected thereby, in
which event the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value
of such Asset and such Asset shall thereafter be treated as an Excluded Asset;
provided, that Buyers right to exclude any such Asset shall not apply to an
Asset with an Allocated Value of less than $100,000 unless Buyers good faith
estimate of the Environmental Defect Value relating to the Environmental
Defect affecting such Asset exceeds $200,000.

 



31 5.4 _Environmental Defect Adjustments_. With respect to each Non-De
Minimus Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, the Parties shall, no later than 10 Business Days after the
Environmental Defect Notice Deadline, attempt in good faith to reach
agreement on the existence of such Non-De Minimus Environmental Defect and the
Environmental Defect Value relating thereto. In the event the Parties do not
reach such agreement by the end of such 10 Business Day period, then:

(a) Seller and Buyer shall each have the option to submit the existence of
the Non-De Minimus Environmental Defect and/or the Environmental Defect Value
to binding determination by the Environmental Expert pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 5.5_; or 

(b) Seller and Buyer may mutually agree to exclude the affected Asset from
the Assets being sold to Buyer under this Agreement, in which event the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset and such
Asset shall thereafter be treated as an Excluded Asset.

 

At Closing, the Environmental Defect Value of any Non-De Minimus Environmental
Defect that is submitted for dispute pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_
shall be deposited into the Defect Escrow Account pursuant to the Defect
Escrow Agreement and shall be deducted in the calculation of the Closing
Amount. On the date that the dispute relating to such Non-De Minimus
Environmental Defect is resolved pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, Seller and
Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent, pursuant to the Defect Escrow Agreement, to disburse the associated
Environmental Defect Value (and any interest and earnings thereon) in
accordance with the decision of the Environmental Expert (for the avoidance of
doubt, if the Environmental Defect Deductible has not been satisfied at the
time of such disbursement, the Environmental Defect Value shall be disbursed
to Seller until satisfaction of the Environmental Defect Deductible).

 

5.5 _Expert Determination of Environmental Defect Values_. If, pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, the existence of a Non-De Minimus Environmental
Defect or the Environmental Defect Value thereof is submitted to expert
arbitration, then the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_.

(a) The determination shall be conducted before a single Person (the
"Environmental Expert"). The Environmental Expert shall be neutral, not an
affiliate, employee or consultant of either Party and shall be an
environmental consultant with at least 10 years of experience in the oil and
gas industry in the State of Texas.

(b) The Parties shall mutually agree on the Environmental Expert;
_provided_ if the Parties are not able to mutually agree on the Environmental
Expert within 5 Business Days after the matter is submitted to arbitration,
the Environmental Expert shall be selected by the Dallas, Texas office of the
American Arbitration Association (or in the event that there is no such office
in Dallas, Texas at such time, by any other office of the American Arbitration
Association) and such arbitration shall take place in Midland, Texas.

 



32 (c) Within 10 Business Days of the selection of the Environmental Expert,
the Parties shall provide to the Environmental Expert the following materials:

 

(i) Buyers Notice of Environmental Defect and all documentation provided
therewith shall be provided to the Environmental Expert (and Buyer shall be
allowed to supplement such Notice of Environmental Defect with additional
documentation or information supporting the existence of such Environmental
Defect and/or Sellers good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect
Value), and Seller shall provide such evidence and documentation as Seller
deems appropriate related to, or to dispute Buyers assertion of the existence
of, the Non-De Minimus Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect Value
assigned thereto by Buyer in the Notice of Environmental Defect, together with
Sellers good faith estimate of the Environmental Defect Value, if any;

(ii) _Sections_ __ _ 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5_ of this Agreement, and the
applicable portions of _Exhibits A,_ __ _ B, C and D_ to this Agreement,
together with any definitions of terms used in such Sections and Exhibits, but
no other provisions of this Agreement; and

 

(iii) Any other additional information requested by the Environmental
Expert.

 

(d) The Environmental Expert shall make his determination and provide to
the Parties written findings within 15 Business Days after he has received
the materials under _Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)._ The decision of the Environmental
Expert shall be final and non-appealable and shall be limited to awarding
only Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to the Environmental
Defect (or a position in between Sellers position and Buyers position). The
Environmental Expert shall make a separate determination with respect to each
Environmental Defect and Environmental Defect Value submitted.

(e) Each Party shall be responsible for paying its own costs of presenting
its case to the Environmental Expert, and the costs of the Environmental
Expert shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer.

(f) The written findings of the Environmental Expert need only set forth
the Environmental Experts award with respect to each Environmental Defect and
Environmental Defect Value, and not the Environmental Experts rationale for
the award.

 

(g) The Environmental Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose
of determining the specific matters disputed and shall not act as an
arbitrator, and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party
with respect to any matter.

 



33 (h) The Parties agree to execute such agreements as may be reasonably
requested or required by the Environmental Expert, including any engagement
letters, releases and indemnities consistent with this Agreement.

 

5.6 _Environmental Defect Reduction Amount_. In the event (a) the
aggregate amount of all Environmental Defect Values attributable to Non-De
Minimus Environmental Defects as finally determined (whether by agreement or
arbitration), exceeds (b) the Environmental Defect Deductible, then the
Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by such excess (the "Environmental
Defect Reduction Amount"), and such reduction shall be reflected, to the
extent determined on the date the Preliminary Settlement Statement is
delivered, on the Preliminary Settlement Statement, and otherwise on the
Final Settlement Statement.

5.7 _"As Is, Where Is" Purchase_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Buyer shall acquire the Assets (including Assets for which a notice
was given under _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ that are not otherwise excluded from
this Agreement) in an "AS IS, WHERE IS" condition and shall assume all risks
that the Assets may contain waste materials (whether toxic, hazardous,
extremely hazardous or otherwise) or other adverse physical conditions,
including the presence of unknown abandoned oil and gas wells, water wells,
sumps, pits, pipelines or other waste or spill sites that may not have been
revealed by Buyers investigation. Subject to _Article 15_ , at and after the
Closing, all responsibility and liability related to all such conditions,
whether known or unknown, fixed or contingent, will be transferred from Seller
to Buyer, regardless of when the responsibility and liability arose.

 

5.8 _Assumed Environmental Liabilities_. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall be deemed to have assumed and agreed to perform and pay (or cause to be
performed and paid) any and all duties, obligations, liabilities and other
Losses (including any civil fines, penalties, costs of assessment, clean-
up, removal and Remediation of pollution or contamination and expenses for
the modification, repair or replacement of facilities on the Lands) directly
or indirectly caused by or otherwise involving any environmental condition of
the Assets, where created or existing before, on or after, the Effective
Time, including the presence, disposal or release of any Hazardous Material,
on or under the Assets, including those brought or assessed by any Persons on
account of post-Effective Time personal injury, illness or death, any damage
to, destruction or loss of property, and any contamination or pollution of
natural resources (including soil, air, surface water or groundwater) (the

respect of debts), (b) the amount of cash available to Seller after taking
into account all other anticipated uses of funds is anticipated to be
sufficient to pay all such amounts on or in respect of debts, when such
amounts are required to be paid, and (c) Seller will have sufficient capital
with which to conduct its business.

 

6.20 _Wells and Equipment; Personal Property_. All Wells operated by
Seller or its Affiliates and, to Sellers knowledge, all other Wells have
been drilled and completed within the limits permitted by all applicable
Leases and no such Well operated by Seller or its Affiliates and, to Sellers
knowledge, no such other Well is subject to penalties on allowables after the
Effective Date because of any overproduction or any other violation of laws.
To Sellers knowledge, all currently producing Wells (and related equipment)
are in an operable state of repair adequate to maintain normal operations in
accordance with past practices, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Seller has
good and marketable title to, or valid rights to lease or otherwise use, all
items of personal property that are included in the Assets, in each case free
and clear of all liens, encumbrances, obligations, or defects, other than
Permitted Encumbrances.

6.21 _Non-Consent Operations_. Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.21
of the Disclosure Schedule_, Seller has not elected not to participate in any
operation or activity proposed with respect to the Assets which could result
in any of Sellers interest in such Assets becoming subject to a penalty or
forfeiture as a result of such election not to participate in such operation
or activity.

 

6.22 _Outstanding Capital Commitments; Payout Balances_. Except as set
forth on  _Section_ __ _ 6.22 of the Disclosure Schedule_, there are no
outstanding authorities for expenditure, known to Seller, which are binding on
the Assets and which Seller reasonably anticipates will individually require
expenditures by the owner of the Assets after the Effective Time in excess of
$100,000, net to the interest of Seller. Provided, however, should Seller
discover, prior to Closing, authorities for expenditures which were in
existence as of the Execution Date and that have been omitted from _Section_
__ _ 6.22 of the Disclosure Schedule_, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of
such omitted items and may supplement and amend _Section_ __ _ 6.22 of the
Disclosure Schedule_ to include such omitted items (and in the event Buyer
obtains knowledge of any such omitted items prior to Closing, Buyer shall
promptly notify Seller of such omitted items) so long as the aggregate amount
of expenditures with respect to such omitted items added to _Section_ __ _
6.22 of the Disclosure Schedule_ after the Execution Date does not exceed 1.5%
of the Base Purchase Price . The Parties further agree that any such
authorities for expenditures added to  _Section_ __ _ 6.22 of the Disclosure
Schedule_, shall, for purposes of the correctness of Sellers representations
in _Section_ __ _ 6.22_ or breaches thereof, as applied in Buyers conditions
in  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_, be subject to the indemnity cap and deductible
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 15.3(a)(ii)_, otherwise limited to breaches of
other representations arising after Closing. As of the date of this
Agreement, the payout balance for each Well and overriding royalty interest
that has a payout balance is reflected in _Section_ __ _ 6.22 of the
Disclosure Schedule_ as of the respective date shown thereon.

the date of this Agreement shall be terminated immediately). Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ by any representative or

of all employees of Seller or its Affiliates who may be considered for
employment by Buyer or its Affiliate (collectively, the "Available
Employees").

 

(b) Not less than 14 days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Buyer or
its Affiliate, in its sole discretion, may make offers of employment, which
offers will be effective as of the Closing Date and contingent upon the
occurrence of Closing ("Employment Date"), to one or more of the Available
Employees that it desires to employ. Any such offer of employment to an
Available Employee shall be for a salary or wage rate that is at least as
favorable as such Available Employees salary of wage rate as of the Execution
Date. Available Employees offered employment shall have not less than

 



44  7 days to accept or reject the offer in writing with the final day of such
period to occur not less than 2 days prior to the Closing Date. Those
Available Employees who accept Buyer or its Affiliates offer of employment
shall then terminate their employment with Seller or its Affiliate effective

of the Employment Date (such Available Employees who actually become
employees of Buyer or its Affiliate as of the Employment Date are referred to
individually and collectively as "Transferring Employees"). Buyer shall be
responsible for all costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and obligations
arising from or relating to (i) the hiring of any Transferring Employee and

result of the Closing of this Agreement, in an amount of a severance payment
equal to one year of base wages for each non-retained Available Employee.

Transferring Employees interests under any Seller benefit plan that is tax
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (excluding any plan loans), to any
similar Buyer benefit plan that is tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, and (ii) cause such Buyer benefit plan to accept any such rollovers if
Buyer or its Affiliate determines, to its reasonable satisfaction, that any
such rollover would not adversely affect the tax qualified status of its
benefit plan.

 

(b) Buyer or its Affiliate shall cause the Transferring Employees to be
credited with credited employment service with Seller and its Affiliates
under the employee benefit plans maintained by Buyer or its Affiliate for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (and not for benefit accruals), but only
if Seller or its Affiliate timely provides adequate records to Buyer or its
Affiliate to support the determination of credited service which are
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer or its Affiliate.

 

(c) For each Transferring Employee, Buyer or its Affiliates shall make a
commercially reasonable effort, subject to approval of the relevant insurers,
to cause Buyers major medical, group health plan to apply towards any
deductible requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits applicable to the
year of such Transferring Employees Employment Date under such Buyers plan,
any amounts paid by such Transferring Employee during such year toward such
requirements and limits under 

 



45  Sellers major medical, group health plan until the Employment Date. As soon
as reasonably practical after each Transferring Employees Employment Date,
and subject to compliance with any Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (" _HIPAA_ ") restrictions or any other applicable
laws concerning protected health information, Seller or its Affiliate shall
provide to Buyer with all information that is reasonably necessary for Buyer
to comply with its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_ with
respect to the affected Transferring Employees, and Buyers obligations under
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(c)_ shall apply only if and to the extent that such
information is timely received by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to it.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall retain responsibility for any
medical, dental or other health and other welfare benefit plan expenses and
benefits with respect to any and all claims incurred with respect to each
Transferring Employee and his or her dependents prior to the Employment Date.

 

9.3 _WARN Act_. Without limiting the provisions of _Article 15_ , Seller
shall be responsible for any WARN Act Obligations related to any Available
Employees loss of employment that occurs on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

9.4 _No Third Party Rights_. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that
all provisions contained in this _Article 9_ are included for the sole
benefit of Seller and Buyer and that nothing contained herein, express or
implied, is intended to (i) confer upon any Person any right to continued
employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific employee
benefit, (ii) constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
employee benefit plan, program or agreement of any kind or (iii) create any
third party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person, any participant
in any benefit plan or any dependent or beneficiary thereof. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of Seller or Buyer or any
of their Affiliates to amend or terminate any particular employee
benefit plan, program, agreement or policy.

Agreement pursuant to clauses (a) through (d) above if such Party is at such
time in material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants in
this Agreement.

11.2 _Liabilities Upon Termination_.

(a) _Buyer s Breach_. If all conditions to the obligations of Buyer set
forth in _Sections_ __ _ 10.1_ and _10.3_ are satisfied or are waived by
Buyer in writing and Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 11.1(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(d)_, and Seller has materially performed
all of its obligations hereunder and has not materially breached any
representation or warranty herein by Seller (collectively, a "Buyers
Breach"), Seller shall retain the Deposit as liquidated damages. Such remedy
shall be Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for Buyers wrongful failure to
tender performance at Closing or other breach of this Agreement, and Seller
expressly waives any and all other remedies, legal and equitable, that they
otherwise may have had for Buyers wrongful failure to close. It is expressly
stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of the damages resulting from
such a breach by Buyer would be difficult if not impossible to determine
accurately because of the unique nature of this Agreement, the unique nature
of the Assets, the uncertainties of applicable commodity markets and
differences of opinion with respect to such matters, and that the liquidated
damages provided for herein are a reasonable estimate by the Parties of such
damages.

 

(b) _Seller s Breach_. If all conditions to the obligations of Seller set
forth in  _Sections_ __ _ 10.1_ and _10.2_ are satisfied or are waived by
Seller in writing and Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 11.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_, and Buyer has materially performed
all of its obligations hereunder and has not materially breached any
representation or warranty herein by Seller, Seller shall return the Deposit
to Buyer immediately after the determination that the Closing will not occur,
and Buyer shall retain any legal or equitable remedies for Sellers breach of
this Agreement, including specific performance; _provided_ that Seller shall
not have any liability to Buyer for 

 



48  consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages, lost profits, or lost
business opportunities arising out of or related to Sellers breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Other Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
_to Section_ __ _ 11.1(e)_ or pursuant to _Sections 11.1(a)  (d)_ in the
absence of a Buyers Breach, Seller shall return the Deposit to Buyer
immediately after such termination.

POST-CLOSING OBLIGATIONS

 

13.1 _Post-Closing Adjustments_. On or before 120 days after the Closing
Date, Seller with the assistance of Buyers staff and with access to such
records as reasonably necessary, shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a final
settlement statement (the "Final Settlement

 



50  Statement") setting forth each adjustment to the Base Purchase Price or
payment that was not finally determined as of the Closing (including payments
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.8_ relating to any Title Defect Reduction
Amount and _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ relating to any Environmental Defect Reduction
Amount) and showing the calculation of such adjustment and the
resulting Purchase Price as finally adjusted (the "Final Purchase Price").
The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth all Wells (on a Well-by-Well or
property-by-property basis) and pipeline imbalances for which no adjustments
to the Base Purchase Price were made in the Preliminary Settlement Statement.
As soon as practicable after receipt of Sellers proposed Final Settlement
Statement, but in any event on or before 30 days after receipt of Sellers
proposed Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written
report containing any changes that Buyer proposes to make to the Final
Settlement Statement. Buyers failure to deliver to Seller a written report
detailing changes to the proposed Final Settlement Statement within such 30
day period shall be deemed an acceptance by Buyer of the Final Settlement
Statement as submitted by Seller. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to
agree with respect to the changes proposed by Buyer, if any, no later than 30
days after receipt by Seller of Buyers comments on the proposed Final
Settlement Statement. The date upon which such agreement is reached or upon
which the Final Purchase Price is established shall be called the "Final
Settlement Date." If the Final Purchase Price is more than the Closing Amount
plus the Deposit plus the amount deposited into the Defect Escrow Account at
Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller the amount of such difference. If the Final
Purchase Price is less than the Closing Amount plus the Deposit plus the
amount deposited into the Defect Escrow Account at Closing, Seller shall pay
to Buyer the amount of such difference. Any such payment by Buyer or Seller
shall be by wire transfer in immediately available funds within 5 Business
Days after the Final Settlement Date. No further adjustments to the Base
Purchase Price shall be made.

 

13.2 _Settlement Statement Dispute Resolution_. If the Parties are unable
to resolve any dispute concerning the Final Settlement Statement or Final
Purchase Price (other than disputes covered by _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_) on or before 30 days after receipt by Seller of Buyers
comments on the proposed Final Settlement Statement, such dispute shall be
finally determined by binding arbitration in Midland, Texas, with the Dallas,
Texas office of Moss Adams LLP, acting as a single arbitrator, pursuant to the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, and the arbitrators determination
shall be final and binding upon Seller and Buyer. The fees charged by the
arbitrator for making a determination under this _Section_ __ _ 13.2_ shall
be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 

13.3 _Records_. Seller shall make the Records available in electronic
form, or if not available in electronic form, for pick up by Buyer at a
mutually agreeable time, in each case, promptly after Closing (but in any
event no later than 5 Business Days after Closing). Seller may retain copies
of the Records; provided, that shall be subject to Section 8.8 with respect
to such copies. For a period of seven years after the Closing, the Records
shall be made available to Seller for review and copying (at Sellers expense)
as reasonably requested at any time after Closing by Seller. Buyer agrees not
to destroy or otherwise dispose of the Records for a period of seven years
after the Closing without giving Seller reasonable notice and an opportunity
to copy the Records.

 



51 13.4 _Suspense Accounts_. At Closing Seller shall transfer to Buyer, and
Buyer shall assume, any Suspense Accounts. Buyer will assume full and complete
responsibility and liability in accordance with applicable Law for proper
handling and payment of such amounts and all accounts and for all
monies payable to royalty owners, mineral owners and other Persons with an
interest in production of Hydrocarbons before, on or after the Effective Time
and of maintaining any necessary suspense accounts relating to production of
Hydrocarbons before, on or after the Effective Time.

13.5 _Removal of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any
case within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the name
"Cimarex", "Prize", "Magnum Hunter" and any variants thereof from the Assets
and shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks or trade names belonging
to Seller or any of its affiliates.

13.6 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after Closing, the Parties
shall each execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered, such further instruments and take such other
action as may be reasonably requested in order to accomplish the purposes
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE 14

 

TAXES

 

14.1 _Responsible Party_. All Property Taxes and Severance Taxes
attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the
Effective Time are the Sellers responsibility, subject to the remaining
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 14.1_, and all refunds pertaining to the
aforementioned Taxes, no matter when received, belong to Seller. All Property
Taxes and Severance Taxes attributable to the ownership or operation of the
Assets on or after the Effective Time are the responsibility of Buyer, subject
to the remaining provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 14.1_, and all
deductions, credits or refunds pertaining to the aforementioned Taxes, no
matter when received, belong to Buyer. Severance Taxes shall be attributable
to the period during which production occurred. Property Taxes, whether or
not based on production, shall be prorated based on a percentage of the
assessment period occurring before the Effective Time. Property Taxes
calculated based on production (other than Severance Taxes) shall be deemed
by the Parties to be attributable to the Tax period for which the Tax is
levied. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, Buyer shall pay all Property Taxes
and Severance Taxes attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets
and not paid on or prior to the Closing Date. Property Taxes and Severance
Taxes that are attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets prior
to the Effective Time and that are not paid as of the Closing Date shall be
treated as a reduction in the Base Purchase Price under _Section_ __ _ 2.7_,
and Property Taxes and Severance Taxes that are attributable to the ownership
and operation of the Assets after the Effective Time and that are paid by
Seller prior to the Closing Date shall be treated as an increase in the Base
Purchase Price under _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. The Parties shall estimate all
Property Taxes and Severance Taxes attributable to the ownership or operation
of the Assets to the extent they relate to the period on and after the
Effective Time and prior to Closing Date and incorporate such estimate into
the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The actual amounts (to the extent the
same differ from the estimate included in the Preliminary Settlement
Statement) shall be accounted for in the Final Settlement Statement.

 



52 14.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
it is acknowledged and agreed by and between Seller and Buyer that the
Purchase Price excludes any sales taxes or other Taxes of a similar nature in
connection with the sale of property pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer and
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith
to exempt the sale, conveyance, assignments and transfers to be made to Buyer
from any sales, use, stamp, real estate transfer, documentary, registration,
recording and other similar Taxes (each a "Transfer Tax"). If a determination
is ever made that a Transfer Tax applies, Buyer will be liable for such
Transfer Tax. Buyer shall prepare and timely file or cause to be filed all
required tax returns and reports for, or related to, or incident to such
Transfer Taxes.

 

14.3 _Tax-Deferred Exchange Option_. Either Party may elect to effect a
tax-deferred exchange under Internal Revenue Code §1031 (a "Tax Deferred
Exchange") for all or part of the Assets at any time prior to the Closing
Date. If a Party elects to effect a Tax-Deferred Exchange ("Electing Party"),
the other Party agrees to execute escrow instructions, documents, agreements
or instruments to effect the exchange; _provided_ that the other Party incurs
no additional costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or connected
with the exchange. Seller and Buyer may assign any of their respective rights
and delegate performance of any of their respective duties under
this Agreement in whole or in part to a Third Party in order to effect such
an exchange; _provided_ that the Electing Party will remain responsible to the
other Party for the full and prompt performance of its respective delegated
duties. The Electing Party will indemnify and hold other Party harmless from
and against all Claims resulting from its participation in any exchange
undertaken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 14.3_ pursuant to the request of
the Electing Party.

14.4 _Allocation of Values_. Seller and Buyer agree that the transaction
under this Agreement is not subject to the reporting requirement of Section
1060 of the Code and that, therefore, IRS Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition
Statement Under Section 1060) is not required to be and will not be filed for
this transaction. In the event that the Seller and Buyer mutually agree that
a filing of Form 8594 is required, Seller and Buyer will confer and cooperate
in the preparation and filing of their respective forms to reflect a
consistent reporting of the agreed upon allocation. In the event that the
allocation is disputed by any taxing authority, the Party receiving notice of
such dispute will promptly notify and consult with the other Party and keep
the other Party apprised of material developments concerning resolution of
such dispute.

14.5 _Tax Returns and Reports_. For tax periods in which the Effective
Time occurs, Seller agrees to immediately forward to Buyer copies of any tax
reports and returns (other than income tax returns) received by Seller after
Closing and provide Buyer with any information Seller has that is necessary
for Buyer to file any required tax reports and returns related to the Assets.
Buyer agrees to file all tax returns and reports applicable to the Assets that
Buyer is required to file after the Closing and, subject to the provisions
of  _Section_ __ _ 14.1_ and _15.3(a)_ , to pay all Taxes payable with
respect to the Assets. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with any
audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to the
Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another Partys
request) the provision of records and information that are relevant to any
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided under this Agreement. Seller and Buyer agree to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Effective Time until the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority.

(b) _Buyer s Indemnification of Seller_. Buyer shall defend, indemnify,
and save and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates, and its and their
respective Representatives (the "Seller Indemnified Parties"), from and
against any and all Losses attributable to or which arise from or in
connection with (i) the Assumed Liabilities

 



56  (including the Assumed Environmental Liabilities and Buyers Plugging and
Abandonment Obligations) and (ii) any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement.

(c) _Scope_. Except as otherwise provided herein or prohibited
by applicable Law, the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall
be without regard to the indemnified Persons sole, joint or concurrent
negligence, gross negligence, strict liability or other fault.

 

15.4 _Procedure_. The indemnification obligations contained in _Section_
__ _ 15.3_ shall be implemented as follows:

(a) _Coverage_. Such indemnity shall extend to all Losses suffered or
incurred by the Indemnified Party.

(b) _Claim Notice_. The party seeking indemnification under the terms of
this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall submit a written "Claim Notice"
to the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") which, to be effective, must
state: (i) the amount of each payment claimed by an Indemnified Party to be
owing, (ii) the basis for such claim, with supporting documentation, and (iii)
a list identifying to the extent reasonably possible each separate item of
Loss for which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within 10 Business Days after
receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of such payment has been
finally established, whichever last occurs.

(c) _Information_. Within 20 Business Days after the Indemnified Party
receives notice of a claim or legal action that may result in a Loss for
which indemnification may be sought under this _Article_ __ _ 15_ ("Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such Claim to
the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that any failure to provide notice within
such time period shall not affect the Indemnified Partys rights to
indemnification hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is materially
adversely affected by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party or its counsel
so requests, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with
copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. At
the election of the Indemnifying Party made within 30 Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying
Party to assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim,
legal action or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying
Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions, the
negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct
of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys choice; 
_provided_ that no such settlement can result in any liability or cost to the
Indemnified Party for which it is entitled to be indemnified hereunder without
its consent not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Indemnifying Party elects
to assume control of a claim or legal action, (i) any expense incurred by the
Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall
be borne by the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give
all reasonable information and assistance that the Indemnifying Party shall
deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim, legal action, or other
matter. In the absence of such an election, the

 



57  Indemnified Party will use its reasonable efforts to defend, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, any claim, legal action or other matter to which
the Indemnifying Partys indemnification under this _Article_ __ _ 15_
applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, and, if the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense within the time period
provided above, settle the same in the Indemnified Partys reasonable
discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense. If such a Claim requires
immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will
cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize
defense of such Claim or either partys position with respect to such Claim.

15.5 _No Insurance; Subrogation_. To the extent of the indemnification
obligations in this Agreement, Buyer and Seller hereby waive for themselves,
their successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to
subrogation for Losses for which each of them is respectively liable or
against which each respectively indemnifies the other, and, if required by
applicable policies, Buyer and Seller shall obtain waiver of such subrogation
from their respective insurers.

 

15.6 _Reservation as to Non-Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to limit or otherwise waive any recourse Buyer or Seller may have
against any Person who is not a party to this Agreement for any obligations or
liabilities that may be incurred with respect to the Assets.

 

15.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after Closing, absent fraud, the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to the matters provided for
in this Agreement shall be pursuant to the express provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ 15_ (provided that _Section_ __ _ 13.6_ shall also be
separately enforceable by Seller and Purchaser, as applicable, pursuant to
whatever rights and remedies are available to it outside of this _Article 15_
), the special warranty of title contained in the Assignment, Bill of Sale and
Conveyance,  _Section_ __ _ 4.7_ with respect to Title Defects, Title Defect
Values and Interest Additions, _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ with respect to
Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Values, and  _Section_ __ _
13.2_ with respect to Settlement Statement Dispute Resolution.

15.8 _Waiver of Right to Rescission_. Other than Buyers right to enforce

or otherwise. Without limitation of the foregoing, Seller expressly disclaims
any and all other representations and warranties, including any warranties or
representations, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, relating
to: (i) title to the Assets; (ii) the condition, quantity, quality, conformity
to models or samples, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or
non-infringement of any Assets; (iii) the accuracy or completeness of any
data, reports, records, projections, information, or materials furnished or

(a) It is the intention of the Parties that Buyers rights and remedies
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and with
respect to all acts or practices of Seller, past, present or future, in
connection with such transactions shall be governed by legal principles other
than the Texas Deceptive Trade PracticesConsumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and
Com. Code Ann. § 17.41 et seq. (the "DTPA"). As such, Buyer hereby waives the
applicability of the DTPA to such transactions and any and all duties,
rights or remedies that might be imposed by the DTPA, whether such duties,
rights and remedies are applied directly by the DTPA itself or indirectly in
connection with other statutes; _provided, however_ , Buyer does not waive §
17.555 of the DTPA. Buyer acknowledges, represents and warrants that it is
purchasing the goods and services covered by this Agreement for commercial or
business use; that it has assets of $5 million or more according to its most
recent financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles; that it has knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters that enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of a
transaction such as this; and that it is not in a significantly disparate
bargaining position with Seller.

 



63 (b) Buyer expressly recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed
to perform its obligations under this Agreement has been predicated upon the
inapplicability of the DTPA and this waiver of the DTPA. Buyer further
recognizes that Seller, in determining to proceed with the entering into of
this Agreement, has expressly relied on this waiver and the inapplicability
of the DTPA.
