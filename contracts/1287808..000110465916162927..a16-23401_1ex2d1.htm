1.5 _Net Working Capital_.

 



 

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Purchasers a good faith
estimate of the Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "),
showing in reasonable detail the calculation thereof in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, and, based thereon, a calculation of the sum of the
Base Price _plus_ or _minus_ , as applicable, the difference between the
Estimated Net Working Capital and the Target Working Capital and _minus_ the
Assumed Indebtedness (if any) and _minus_ the Australian Promissory Note
Purchase Price (such aggregate being, the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "). In
their preparation of the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Sellers shall (i)
consult with the Purchasers (which shall include, upon Purchasers reasonable
request, providing the Purchasers and their advisors with supporting
documentation in relation to the calculation of such estimates) and (ii)
consider any reasonable comments of the Purchasers and their advisors.

 



 

(b) As promptly as possible, but in any event within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, the Purchasers shall cause the Companies to prepare and deliver
to the Sellers an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Closing Balance
Sheet_ "), and a statement showing the calculation of the Net Working Capital
derived from the Closing Balance Sheet, together with the detailed working
papers which support the contents of the Closing Balance Sheet (together with
the Closing Balance Sheet, the " _Preliminary Statement_ "). The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared and the Net Working Capital shall be
determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles. For clarity, an
illustrative calculation of Net Working Capital as though the Closing had
occurred on June 30, 2016, which the parties hereto agree has been calculated
properly for purposes of this _Section 1.5(b)_, is included on _Schedule
1.5(b)_. After delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Purchasers and
Companies shall give the Sellers and their advisors reasonable access during
the 30-day period after delivery of the Preliminary Statement to review the
work papers, books, records and schedules prepared by the Companies and their
accountants in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Statement,
provided that such access shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of any Company. The Sellers and
their accountants may make reasonable inquiries of the Companies and their
accountants regarding questions concerning, or disagreements with, the
Preliminary Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the
Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their accountants
to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If the Sellers have any
objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Sellers shall deliver to the
Companies and the Purchasers a statement setting forth in reasonable detail
their objections thereto and proposed adjustments to the Preliminary Statement
and the reasons therefor (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections
Statement is not delivered by the Sellers within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Preliminary Statement shall be
final,

      
 

 



 

binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Sellers and the
Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections and agree
any proposed adjustments set forth in the Objections Statement, but if they do
not reach a final resolution with respect to all of the matters set forth in
the Objections Statement within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement, the Sellers and the Purchasers shall submit any amounts
remaining in dispute to an Independent Expert (the " _Dispute Resolution
Accountants_ "). The Purchasers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, shall submit an affidavit to the other evidencing no conflict or
other meaningful professional relationship with the Dispute Resolution
Accountants, and the Dispute Resolution Accountants shall so certify in
writing to the Purchasers and the Sellers that no such conflicts or other
meaningful professional relationships exist. Any further submissions to the
Dispute Resolution Accountants must be written and contemporaneously delivered
to each party to the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Accountants shall
consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections
Statement as being items which the Sellers and the Purchasers are unable to
resolve (" _Disputed Amounts_ "). The Dispute Resolution Accountants
determination will be based solely on the definition of Net Working Capital
contained herein and its decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the
range of values assigned to each such item in the Preliminary Statement and
the Objections Statement, respectively. The Sellers and the Purchasers shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution
Accountants to resolve all Disputed Amounts as soon as practicable and in any
event within twenty (20) days after the submission of any dispute. Further,
the Dispute Resolution Accountants determination shall be based solely on the
presentations by the Purchasers and the Sellers which are in accordance with
the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the
basis of an independent review). The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute
Resolution Accountants shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the
parties hereto.

 



 

(c) The Purchasers shall pay a portion of the fees and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Accountants equal to 100% multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Disputed Amounts submitted to the Dispute Resolution
Accountants that are resolved in favor of the Sellers and the denominator of
which is the total amount of Disputed Amounts submitted to the Dispute
Resolution Accountants. The Sellers shall pay that portion of the fees and
expenses of the Dispute Resolution Accountants that the Purchasers are not
required to pay hereunder.

 



 

(d) If the Net Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 1.5(b)_ is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, (i) the
Purchasers shall promptly pay or cause the Companies to pay to or as directed
by the Sellers such excess amount in accordance with _Section 1.6_, and (ii)
the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be released in its entirety together
with all accrued interest thereon by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers, and the
Purchasers shall timely cooperate and provide any written authorization or
direction to the Escrow Agent as prescribed under the Escrow Agreement to
facilitate such release. If the Net Working Capital as finally determined in
accordance with _Section 1.5(b)_ is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, then such shortfall amount shall be paid by the Escrow Agent from the
Working Capital Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement
and the Sellers shall timely cooperate and provide any written authorization
or direction to the Escrow Agent as prescribed under the Escrow Agreement to
facilitate such release. If such shortfall amount is greater than the Working
Capital Escrow Amount, then the Sellers shall

      
 

 



 

promptly pay to or as directed by the Purchasers the amount by which such
shortfall amount exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount in accordance with
_Section 1.6_.

 



 

(e) For the purposes of this _Section 1.5_, ordinary mathematical conventions
shall apply to determine whether or not an amount ("x") exceeds another amount
("y"), so that, where one or both of x and y is a negative number:

 



 

(i) if x < 0, y > 0, then y > x. For example, if x = - 50 and y = 65, then y
will exceed x (with the amount of such difference being 115); and

 



 

(ii) if x < 0, y < 0, then x > y if (0  x) < (0  y). For example, if x = -50
and y = -65, then x will exceed y (with the amount of such difference being
15).

 



 

(f) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.5_ shall be treated for all
purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

1.6 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. The Purchasers shall immediately (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days) deliver or cause to be delivered
to or as directed by the Sellers any amounts determined pursuant to _Section
1.5(d)_ to be due by the Purchasers by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account(s) designated by the Sellers. The Sellers shall
immediately (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) deliver or cause
to be delivered to or as directed by the Purchasers any amounts determined
pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ to be due by the Sellers in excess of the
Working Capital Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account(s) designated by the Purchasers.

 



 

1.7 _No Impairment of Other Rights_. Subject to _Section 8.2(d)_, the final
determination of the Net Working Capital under _Section 1.5_ shall not impair
any other rights of a party under this Agreement including, without
limitation, any rights to indemnification.

 



 

1.8 _Provisions Relating to Escrow Amounts_.

 



 

(a) The Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be
held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and, with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Indemnity
Letter of Credit.

 



 

(b) The Working Capital Escrow Amount shall serve as security, and a source of
payment, solely for amounts determined pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_ to be due
to the Purchasers, if any. The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall serve as
security, and a source of payment, solely for amounts payable to the
Purchasers in order to satisfy Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant
to _Article 8_, if any.

 



 

(c) The Indemnity Letter of Credit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Purchasers. The Sellers shall deliver (or caused to be delivered) a
draft of the proposed Indemnity Letter of Credit to the Purchasers for their
review at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent by the
Sellers by delivery of the Indemnity Letter of Credit; provided, that, in lieu
of the Indemnity

      
 

 



 

Letter of Credit, cash in the amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount
shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent by the Purchasers and such amount shall
be deducted from the amount payable under _Section 1.4(g)(iv)_, if the
Purchasers acting reasonably and in good faith, determine that the Indemnity
Letter of Credit is not in a form satisfactory to the Purchasers.

commitment of Sponsor Funds,

      
 

 



 

upon the terms and subject to the full satisfaction of the conditions set
forth therein, to provide severally to the Purchasers (via the Purchasers
parent entities) up to their respective pro rata shares of the cash equity
financing stated therein to fund a portion of the amount payable by the
Purchasers at Closing (the " _Equity Financing_ ") and

 



 

(ii) an executed facilities agreement dated on or prior to the date hereof,
(the " _Facilities Agreement_ " and together with the Equity Commitment Letter
the " _Definitive Financing Arrangements_ "), from Senior Loan Fund I (A)
Investments (Luxembourg) S.a.r.l., and HSBC Bank plc (collectively, "
_Lenders_ ") relating to the commitment of Lenders, upon the terms and subject
to the full satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein, to provide, upon
the terms and subject to the full satisfaction of the conditions set forth
therein, up to the full amount of the debt financing stated therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ " and together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_
").

 



 

(b) The Purchasers have delivered to the Sellers a true, complete and correct
copy of each Definitive Financing Arrangement. Assuming satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_, and that the
Financing is funded on the terms contemplated by the Definitive Financing
Arrangements in all material respects, each Purchaser will have sufficient
cash in immediately available funds or available under credit lines to pay,
fund or discharge all of the items to be paid, funded or discharged by such
Purchaser at the Closing under this Agreement. In no event shall the receipt
or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing ) by or to
the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or any other financing transaction be
a condition to any of the obligations of the Purchasers hereunder. The
Purchasers have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment
fees or other fees due and payable in connection with the Definitive Financing
Arrangements and will timely pay in full any such amounts as they become due
and the Definitive Financing Arrangements are in full force and effect and are
valid, binding and enforceable against the Purchasers, and to each Purchasers
Knowledge, the other parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms
(except to the extent limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
other similar Applicable Law affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity) and the respective commitments
have not been withdrawn, reduced, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended
or modified (and to the Purchasers Knowledge no such withdrawal, reduction,
rescission, termination, amendment or modification is contemplated);
_provided_ , that the existence or exercise of any "flex provisions" contained
in the Facilities Agreement or any document ancillary thereto shall not
constitute an amendment or modification of the Definitive Financing
Arrangements) in any respect. No event has occurred that would constitute a
material breach or material default (or with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a material default) under any Definitive Financing
Arrangement by any Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of the Purchasers, any other
party thereto. There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than the conditions precedent set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter and Clause 4.5(a) (Utilisations during the
Certain Funds Period) and Part II of Schedule 2 of the Facilities Agreement.
The Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing to be satisfied by the Purchaser will not be satisfied on or prior
to the Closing Date or that the Financing will not be made available to the
Purchaser on the Closing Date. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ , there
are no side letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements
relating to any Definitive Financing Arrangement or Financing to which the
Purchasers or any of its Affiliates is a party that could

      
 

 



 

affect the amount or availability of the Financing on the Closing Date, other
than those expressly set forth in the Definitive Financing Arrangements.
Purchasers have delivered copies of all side letters, understandings or other
agreements or arrangements set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ to Sellers.

 



 

4.10 _Independent Investigation_. The Purchasers have conducted to their
satisfaction an investigation, review, analysis and verification of the
business, results of operations, prospects, condition (financial or
otherwise), assets, liabilities and properties of the Companies and their
respective Company Subsidiaries, and acknowledge that they have been provided
satisfactory access to the personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and
records, and other documents and data of the Sellers, the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries for such purpose. Each Purchaser understands,
acknowledges and agrees that, in making its decision to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, such
Purchaser has relied solely upon its own investigation, review, analysis and
verification and the representations and warranties of the Sellers expressly
and specifically set forth in this Agreement and the certificates contemplated
hereby or delivered in connection herewith (including the Steps Memo
representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ and the related
portions of the Disclosure Schedules).

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 
COVENANTS OF THE SELLERS**

 



 

5.1 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly:

manage, operate, control, be employed by or participate or assist in the
ownership, management, operation or control of any business engaged in, or
that competes with the Business, directly or indirectly (other than (x) risk
management or management consulting services which are consistent with the
past practice of the Project Management Business in the twelve (12) months
preceding the date of this Agreement, and which do not relate to claims or
resolution of claims (unless such services are a continuation of a Contract of
the Project Management Business with any Person and such services represent no
more than 5% of the aggregate revenues relating to that Person under the
relevant Contract) or (y) in respect of the period from the date hereof to the
Closing Date, the ownership and operation of the Business itself);

 



 

(ii) solicit for employment or hire any employee of or consultant to any
Company or Company Subsidiary or any Person who was an employee or consultant
within the one-year period prior to being solicited or hired (or such shorter

shall not preclude any Seller or Affiliate of any Seller from soliciting for
employment or hiring any such employee or consultant who (A) responds to a
general solicitation through a public medium or general or mass mailing by or
on behalf of such Seller or any of its Affiliates that is not targeted at the
employees of or consultants to any Company or Company Subsidiary or (B) has

      
 

 



 

been terminated by any Company or Company Subsidiary prior to being solicited
for employment by any Seller or Affiliate of any Seller; or

 



 

(iii) solicit or endeavor to solicit Business from or entice away from any
Company or Company Subsidiary, endeavor to reduce the Business conducted with
any Company or Company Subsidiary by, or otherwise interfere with the Business

supplier, vendor or service provider to, or other Person having material
Business relations with, any Company or Company Subsidiary.

 



 

From the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
the Sellers, where an opportunity to make such a referral exists, shall use
best efforts to refer its clients who require claims consulting services or
other advice which is part of the offering of the Business to any Company or
Company Subsidiary save that the Sellers shall not be required to incur any
out-of-pocket expenses in fulfilling such referral obligations.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the continued conduct by the Sellers of the
Project Management Business in the manner in which the Project Management
Business (as distinct from the Business) is conducted as of the date of this
Agreement, without more, shall not be deemed to be a violation of this
_Section 5.1_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Sellers shall not be prohibited from (A) providing claims management
services or fact-based testimony services which are a continuation of a
Contract of the Project Management Business with any Person (and which
services represent no more than 5% of the aggregate revenues relating to that
Person under the relevant Contract or Contracts) or endeavoring to solicit the
business of any Person for the Project Management Business, in each case, in
the manner in which the Project Management Business (as distinct from the
Business) is conducted as of the date of this Agreement; or (B) engaging one
or more subcontractors to provide claims management services or fact-based
testimony services to clients of the Project Management Business in connection
with a continuation of a Contract of the Project Management Business with any
Person (and which services represent no more than 5% of the aggregate revenues
relating to that Person under the relevant Contract or Contracts); provided
that, in the case of both (A) and (B), the Sellers shall not take or permit
any action to be taken (x) with the intent of reducing or interfering in any
way with any relationship of any Company or Company Subsidiary with any
client, potential client, employee, contractor or supplier, or (y) which is
inconsistent with the past practice of the Project Management Business in the
twelve (12) months preceding the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) At all times after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) disclose, divulge or make use of any trade secrets or other information of
a business, financial, marketing, technical or other nature pertaining to the
Purchasers, the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or the Business, including
information of others that the Purchasers, any Company or any Company
Subsidiary has agreed to keep confidential, except (a) to the extent that such
information shall have become public knowledge other than by breach of this
Agreement by any of the Sellers,

      
 

 



 

(b) to the extent such information becomes available to the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates after the Effective Time on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than any of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates, (c) to the extent that disclosure of such information
is requested by any Governmental Entity or is otherwise required by Applicable
Law (but, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, only after the Sellers
have provided the Companies with reasonable notice and opportunity to take
action against any such requested or required disclosure) or (d) to the extent
the use or disclosure of such information is (A) permitted by or necessary for
the performance by any Seller of this Agreement or the Transition Services
Agreement or (B) necessary to enforce any of Sellers rights under this
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) make or cause to be made any disparaging statements regarding any
Company, any Company Subsidiary, any Purchaser, the Sponsor, or any of their
respective Affiliates or the Business; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall
not prohibit any Seller from making any truthful statements (if required by
any contract existing as at the date of this Agreement or by law to make such
a statement) or testifying truthfully in any action, proceeding,
investigation, case, or similar venue or other communication with any
Governmental Entity.

 



 

(c) It is the desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that the
provisions of _Section 5.1_ shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the law and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in
which enforcement is sought. If any provision of _Section 5.1_ is at any time
determined to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of being vague or
unreasonable as to duration, area, scope of activity or otherwise, then such
provision will be considered divisible (with the other provisions of this
Agreement to remain in full force and effect) and the invalid or unenforceable
provisions will not become and be deemed to be immediately amended to include
only such time, area, scope or activity and other restrictions as will be
determined to be reasonable and enforceable by the court or other body having
jurisdiction over the matter, and each party expressly agrees that this
Agreement, as so amended, will be valid and binding as though any invalid or
unenforceable provision had not been included herein.

 



 

(d) The parties recognize that the performance of the obligations under
_Section 5.1_ by the Sellers and their respective Affiliates is special and
unique in character, and that in the event of the breach or threatened breach
by any Seller of the terms and conditions of _Section 5.1_ to be performed by
such Seller, the Purchasers and the Companies (and their respective
Subsidiaries) may suffer irreparable injury, the amount of which may be
difficult to estimate or determine and which may not be adequately
compensated. Therefore, the Purchasers and the Companies (and their respective
Subsidiaries) will be entitled, if they so elect, to seek and (subject to
court approval) to obtain damages for any breach of such Section, or to seek
to enforce the specific performance thereof by such breaching Seller,
temporarily and permanently enjoin the breaching Seller and any of its
employees or its Affiliates from engaging in such breach or threatened breach,
or seek other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. The
right provided under this _Section 5.1(d)_ shall be in addition to, and not
in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the Purchasers, the
Companies or the Company Subsidiaries.

      
 

 



 

(e) Each Seller (i) has carefully read and understands all of the provisions
of this Agreement and has had the opportunity for this Agreement to be
reviewed by counsel, (ii) acknowledges that the duration, geographical scope
and subject matter of _Section 5.1_ of this Agreement are reasonable and
necessary to protect the goodwill, client relationships, legitimate business
interests, trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information of the
Business, (iii) acknowledges that the Purchasers would not have closed the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the benefits contained in
this Agreement, and (iv) understands that this Agreement is assignable by the
Purchasers to the extent permitted under _Section 11.4_ and shall inure to
the benefit of their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

5.2 _Company Intellectual Property_. If any Seller owns or shall at any time
hereafter acquire any rights in any Company Intellectual Property, other than
Seller Retained Marks, such Seller shall, and hereby does, transfer all of its
rights, title and interest in such Company Intellectual Property to the
Companies (or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable) for no additional
consideration. Each Seller shall execute and deliver such additional documents
and instruments and take such other actions as the Purchasers shall reasonably
request to give effect to the provisions of this Section.

 



 

5.3 _General Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller on its own
behalf, and on behalf of all members of the Seller Group, voluntarily,
knowingly and irrevocably releases and forever discharges the Companies, the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, managers and
employees from any and all actions, agreements, amounts, claims, damages,
expenses, liabilities and obligations of every kind, nature or description,
known or unknown, arising or existing prior to the Closing, provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver
or release of (x) any rights of indemnification to which _Section 6.3_
relates or (y) any rights of any member of the Seller Group under this
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or any other agreement entered
into pursuant to this Agreement. Save that no Company or Company Subsidiary
shall be released in the event of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation of
such person.

 



 

5.4 _Stub Period Financial Statements_. For the period commencing as of the
date hereof and ending as of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to
the Purchasers (a) the consolidated unaudited balance sheet of the Companies
and their respective Company Subsidiaries for each month after the month of
the Latest Balance Sheet, together with the related statements of cash flows
and income for the period then ended, and (b) any other regularly-prepared
financial reporting. Such financial statements and information shall be
delivered within thirty (30) days after the end of such month or, if earlier,
concurrent with the provision of such information to management

 



 

5.5 _Share Incentive Plans_. The provisions of this _Section 5.5_ shall have
effect in the event that any employee, officer or director of any Company,
Company Subsidiary or, on or after Closing, of any company in the Purchaser
Group that participates in the Share Incentive Plans (for the purposes of this
_Section 5.5_. only, a " _Relevant Person_ ") realizes an Award Gain and any
company in the Purchaser Group is obliged to account for any Employee Taxation
or to pay any Employer Taxation on, or at any time after, Closing:

      
 

 



 

(a) the Sellers will immediately notify the Purchasers if and when a Relevant
Person acquires a Relevant Award, or exercises, assigns or releases a Relevant
Award or if the Relevant Person receives any benefit or acquires shares in
connection with a Relevant Award, and the Purchasers will in turn immediately
notify the Sellers if any company in the Purchaser Group must, under
Applicable Law, account for any Employee Taxation and/or Employer Taxation in
excess of $1,000 (the " _Award Tax Threshold_ ") in respect of such exercise
of a Relevant Award;

 



 

(b) with respect to any Relevant Award or Awards held by a Relevant Person
with respect to which any member of the Purchaser Group must, under Applicable
Law, account for any Employee and/or Employer Taxation in excess of the Award
Tax Threshold (either per Relevant Award or in aggregate with respect to such
Relevant Person), the Sellers will, and will cause the other members of the
Seller Group, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to exercise and
enforce all of their respective rights under the rules of the Share Incentive
Plans or otherwise recover all Employee Taxation and, if permissible by law,
all Employer Taxation in respect of the Award Gain and will procure that any
such Employee and Employer Taxation so recovered will be paid to the relevant
company in the Purchaser Group promptly; and

 



 

(c) the Sellers shall ensure, to the extent required under Applicable Law,
that all relevant end-of-year filings in connection with the participation of
Relevant Persons in the Share Incentive Plans are made by the Relevant Tax
Authority deadlines and copies provided to the Purchasers as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter. Unless otherwise agreed by both parties,
the Sellers will provide to the Purchasers all information in the Sellers
possession that any company in the Purchaser Group is required to provide to
or notify to any Tax Authority in respect of the vesting, exercise,
assignment, release or receipt of Relevant Awards upon request by or on behalf
of the Purchasers and in any event by no later than fourteen (14) days after
such request.

extent of Applicable Law. On or prior to the Closing, the Purchasers shall
have purchased so-called "tail" policy coverage (or the equivalent thereof)
with respect to the Companies and Company Subsidiaries existing directors
and officers (or equivalent) liability insurance policies with a fresh,
unimpaired aggregate limit of liability, and containing terms and conditions
that are no less favorable to the directors and officers (or equivalent) of
the Companies and Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, as the Companies and
Company Subsidiaries existing directors and officers (or equivalent)
liability insurance policies, and from insurance carriers with at least
comparable claims paying ability ratings, all in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Sellers (the " _Tail Policies_ "). Until the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Purchasers shall cause the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries (a) not to amend or otherwise modify the coverage
under the Tail Policies or take any action that would result in the
cancellation, termination, amendment or modification of any Tail Policy and
(b) to continue to honor their respective obligations under the Tail Policies.
If any Company or Company Subsidiary is acquired during such Period, the
Company or Company Subsidiary will require in any agreement relating to its
being acquired that the acquirer shall maintain in effect the insurance
required by this Section. The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ are intended
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each current and former
employee, officer, manager and director of each Company and its Company
Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have had by Contract or otherwise. At or
prior to the Closing, the Purchasers shall deliver copies of the Tail Policies
to the Sellers.

 



 

6.4 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_.

 



 

(a) Subject at all times to the provisions of _Section 5.5_, from and after

the Purchasers shall cause each Company and its Company Subsidiaries to
maintain, in relation to any employees or consultants in the United States,
employment, severance, termination, consulting, retirement and other
compensation, benefit plans, arrangements and agreements for such employees of
such Company or such Company Subsidiary (as of the Closing) that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to such plans, arrangements and
agreements are in effect on the date hereof (it being understood that this
_Section 6.4_ shall not be deemed to prohibit any Purchaser, Company or
Company Subsidiary from amending, modifying, replacing or terminating such
arrangements in accordance with their terms). Further, Purchasers shall be
solely responsible for any liability for any employees or former employees of
such Company or Company Subsidiary including but not limited to, liability for
wages, severance, termination payments, and liability under the WARN Act for
payment, benefits and/or notice that arises as a result of any employment
loss, termination of employment, layoff and/or reduction in hours of any
employee of such Company or Company Subsidiary as of, or as a result of, the
Closing (other than those actions which take place pursuant to the Seller
Reorganization). This _Section 6.4_ shall survive the Closing, is

       
 

 



 

intended to benefit the Sellers, each Company and its Company Subsidiaries,
and the employees of each Company and its Company Subsidiaries, and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of each Purchaser and each Company and
its Company Subsidiaries. This _Section 6.4_ is not intended to amend any
Benefit Plans or programs of the Sellers or each Company and its Company
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) The Purchasers and the Sellers shall, to the extent possible, (i) treat
the Purchasers and each Company and its Company Subsidiaries as a "successor
employer" and each Company and its Company Subsidiaries as a "predecessor,"
within the meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with
respect to each Company (and its Subsidiaries) employees to be employed by
such Company and its Company Subsidiaries for purposes of Taxes imposed under
the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal
Insurance Contributions Act and (ii) cooperate with each other to avoid the
filing of more than one IRS Form W-2 with respect to each such employee for
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Person who (i) was an employee of a Company or Company
Subsidiary prior to the Closing, (ii) elected to receive an end of service
gratuity payment in connection with such Persons termination of service prior
to the Closing, and (iii) on or after the Closing, is an employee of any
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Companies and
Company Subsidiaries from and after the Closing), the Purchasers shall not,
and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates (including the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries from and after the Closing) to, (A) take
into consideration, "grandfather" or otherwise credit all or any portion of
the length of such Persons service as an employee of any Company or Company
Subsidiary attributable to the period prior to the Closing to the length of
such Persons service as an employee of any Purchaser or their respective
Affiliates (including the Companies and Company Subsidiaries from and after
the Closing) from and after the Closing for the purpose of calculating the
amount of any end of service gratuity or other payment payable to such Person
upon the termination of such Persons employment with any Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates (including the Companies and Company Subsidiaries
from and after the Closing), or (B) otherwise offer any benefit to any such
Person intended to entice or cause such Person to crystalize his or her end of
service gratuity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.5 _R andW Policy_. Promptly after the RandW Policy is received by the
Purchasers, the Purchasers shall deliver a copy of the RandW Policy to Sellers.
No Purchaser will, and the Purchasers will cause their respective Affiliates
(including the Companies and Company Subsidiaries after the Closing) not to,
amend, waiver or otherwise modify any provision of the RandW Policy in any
manner that would allow the insurer of the RandW Policy or any other Person to
subrogate or otherwise make or bring any action or proceedings against any
Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any past, present or future director,
manager officer, employee or advisor of any of the foregoing based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement.

Company or Company Subsidiary to, for a period of seven (7) years following
the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and
records of any Company or Company Subsidiary for any period on or prior to the
Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior written notice to the
Sellers and offering to surrender to the Sellers such books and records or any
portion thereof which the applicable Purchaser or the applicable Company (or
any of its Company Subsidiaries) may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, and subject to Applicable Law and the

the Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior written notice to the
Purchasers and offering to surrender to the Purchasers such books and records
or any portion thereof which the applicable Seller or the member of the Seller
Group may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.

 



 

(d) In furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, the
Purchasers will provide and, as applicable, cause their respective employees
and Affiliates and their employees to provide, commercially reasonable
cooperation with requests by or on behalf of any Seller pursuant to _Section

only be obligated to cause any Person to cooperate with the Sellers pursuant
to this _Section 7.2(d)_ if and for so long as the Purchasers are capable of
directing the actions of such Person.

 



 

(e) Any access granted to either party or its Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 7.2_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the party granting such
access. The party to whom such access or other cooperation is granted pursuant
to this _Section 7.2_ shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead,
salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred by the other party or its
Representatives in connection therewith.

to provide the other party or its Representatives with access to (A) personnel
records of employees relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other information which, in the disclosing partys good
faith opinion, is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject such
party or its Affiliates to risk of liability, or (B) information the
disclosure of which, in the disclosing partys good faith opinion (x) would
conflict with confidentiality obligations to which such party or any of its
Affiliates is bound, or (y) would reasonably be expected to result in the
forfeiture or waiver of any attorney-client or similar privilege; _provided_ ,
that in the case of this clause (y), the disclosing party shall use reasonable
best efforts to provide the other party, to the extent possible, with access
to the relevant information in a manner that would not reasonably be expected

privilege, or (ii) either partys independent accountants to make available to

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchasers and

(c) The Sellers and the Purchasers agree to execute and deliver such other

(d) The Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to arrange, and obtain the proceeds of, the Financing on
or prior to the Closing Date subject only to the conditions set forth in Part
II of Schedule 2 of the Facilities Agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to: (i) until the execution of the definitive financing agreements,
maintain in effect and enforce all material rights under each Definitive
Financing Arrangement and comply with their respective material obligations
thereunder; (ii) satisfy or obtain the waiver of on a timely basis (and in a
manner that will not prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) all conditions within their
reasonable control and comply in all respects with the covenants applicable to
the Purchasers to the funding of the Financing and any definitive agreements
to be executed in connection therewith and (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Definitive Financing Arrangements (including, if
necessary, any "flex" provisions) in all material respects (or on such other
terms as the Purchasers and the Lenders shall agree so long as the terms of
the definitive financing agreements (A) do not reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing set forth in the Facilities Agreement (except to the extent
of an increase in the aggregate amount of Equity Financing pursuant to a
binding commitment letter) to an amount that, when combined with the amount of
Equity Financing, is less than sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and pay the fees and expenses required to be paid at
Closing contemplated hereby, (B) do not contain additional or modified
conditions beyond those contained in the contingency to the funding of the
Debt Financing contained in the Facilities Agreement as of the date hereof
and/or (C) could not be reasonably expected to (and in fact do not) (1)
prevent, impede or, in any material respect, delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) materially and

      
 

 



 

adversely affect the ability or likelihood of the Purchasers to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (3) make the satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less likely to occur. The
Purchasers shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed on a timely basis and
reasonable manner of the status of their efforts to obtain the Financing. The
Purchasers shall give the Sellers prompt notice of any material fact, change,
event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse impact with respect to the Financing,
including notice in writing of any breach or default by any Purchaser or, to
the Purchasers Knowledge, any other party with respect to any Definitive
Financing Arrangement or any condition precedent to funding on the Closing or
any material dispute between the parties to the Definitive Financing
Arrangements related to any such Definitive Financing Arrangement of which the
Purchaser becomes aware. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any
funds or financing (including the Financing) by or to the Purchasers or any of
their respective Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition
to any of the obligations of the Purchasers hereunder. Prior to the Closing,
no Purchaser nor any Affiliate of any Purchaser shall agree to or permit any
termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of, or
waive any of its rights under, any Definitive Financing Arrangement without
the Sellerss prior written consent, provided that Purchasers may amend,
replace, supplement or modify the Facilities Agreement without any such Seller
consent if such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification (A) does
not contain additional conditions beyond those contained in the Facilities
Agreement as of the date hereof or adversely modify any existing condition or
contingency to the funding of the Debt Financing contained in the Facilities
Agreement as of the date hereof, (B) does not reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing (except to the extent of an increase in the aggregate
amount of the Equity Financing pursuant to a binding commitment letter
containing substantially the same terms as the Equity Commitment Letter and
provided that Purchasers shall promptly deliver a copy of such binding
commitment letter to Purchasers), (C) does not adversely impact the ability of
any Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to the Facilities
Agreement to the extent necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (D) otherwise would not reasonably be expected to (and
in fact does not) (1) prevent, impede or, in any material respect, delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (2) make
the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing materially less
likely to occur; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Purchasers may enter into discussions regarding, and
amend the Facilities Agreement to enter into, arrangements and agreements
relating to the Debt Financing, in each case to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities. In the event that all or
a portion of the financings contemplated by the Definitive Financing
Arrangements becomes unavailable on substantially the same terms contemplated
in the Definitive Financing Arrangement, the Purchasers shall use their
reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange replacement financing, on terms that
are not materially less favorable to the Purchasers, in the aggregate, than
the terms contained in the applicable Definitive Financing Arrangement, from
alternative sources as promptly as practicable in an amount sufficient,
together with any cash held by Buyer, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) obtain new financing commitment and
fee letters with respect to such replacement financing which shall be promptly
provided to the Sellers (an " _Alternative Debt Financing_ "). Upon any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification permitted by this _Section
7.5(d)_, the term " _Definitive Financing_

      
 

 



 

 _Arrangement_ " shall mean the Definitive Financing Arrangement as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or modified.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel,

cooperation to the extent it would, in the Sellers reasonable discretion, (1)
materially and unreasonably interfere with the Business or operations of any
member of the Seller Group, Company or Company Subsidiary, (2) cause any
representation, warranty, covenant or other term in this

      
 

 



 

Agreement to be breached or inaccurate or materially violate any Contract to
which any member of the Seller Group, Company or Company Subsidiary is a
party, (3) cause any closing condition set forth in this Agreement to fail to

and from and after the Closing none of the members of the Seller Group nor any
of their respective Affiliates, shall (1) have any liability or obligation
under any loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or
document related to any financing undertaken by the Purchasers in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (2) be required to
incur any other liability in connection with any financing undertaken by the
Purchasers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or take any action that would be prohibited by any Applicable Law or cause a
default of, or breach under, or otherwise violate any Contract that is
material to any member of the Seller Group, Company or Company Subsidiary, or
(3) be required to take any corporate (or equivalent) action related to any
Financing (other than to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Steps Memo or the Transition Services Agreement). Any obligation of the

their advisors) as required in connection with any financing undertaken by the

subject to customary confidentiality obligations by such potential Lenders.

 



 

The Purchasers shall promptly reimburse the Sellers, Companies, the Company
Subsidiaries, or their Affiliates, as applicable, for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
costs) to the extent such costs and expenses are incurred by such Person in

other representatives pursuant to the terms of this _Section 7.5(e)_ or in
connection with compliance with its obligations under this _Section 7.5(e)_.

and Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing) from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement
of the financings contemplated by the Definitive Financing Arrangements and
the performance of their respective obligations under _Section 7.5(d)_,
except in the event such losses, damages, claims, penalties, costs and
expenses arose out of or resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any Seller or, in respect of the period prior to Closing, of any
Company, Company Subsidiary or their respective Representatives. Whether or
not the Closing occurs, the Purchasers shall, promptly upon written request by
the Sellers, reimburse Sellers and its Affiliates for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any of them (including
those of its accountants, consultants, legal counsel,

      
 

 



 

agents and other Representatives) in connection with the cooperation required
by _Section 7.5(d)_ that was paid simultaneously in accordance with the
above.

 



 

(f) The Sellers hereby consent to the use of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that

likely to harm or disparage the Sellers, the Companies, or any Company
Subsidiary or the reputation or goodwill of the Sellers, the Companies, or any
Company Subsidiary and their respective marks.

 



 

(g) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Purchasers shall make appropriate filing of the FIRB Application with respect

whether any further action by, or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required, and (ii) in taking such actions or making
such any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith, and seeking to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers in a timely manner.

 



 

7.6 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Purchasers shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
filed all Stand-Alone Returns relating to Taxes for all periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Returns_ ") that are due after the
Closing Date (taking into account extensions) (for the avoidance of doubt,
such Pre-Closing Returns shall not include any Tax Return filed by a
consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated group that includes the Sellers
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand). Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for the
reasonable "out-of-pocket" expenses incurred in preparing such Pre-Closing
Returns. All such Pre-Closing Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the past practice of such Company and such Company Subsidiary, as the
case may be, except as otherwise required under Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers Expenses, the
write off of unamortised debt expense with respect to Indebtedness paid in
connection with the Closing, and all Sale Bonuses, in each case to the extent
such item is deductible by any Company or Company Subsidiary under Applicable
Laws, shall be taken as deductions on the Pre-Closing Returns of such Company
or Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, to the extent permitted under
Applicable Laws and, in the case of any Tax Returns filed for a Straddle
Period, with respect to which such deductions are permitted, shall be
allocated to the portion of the period up to and including the Closing Date.
For this purpose, the safe harbor of Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 IRB
746 shall be applied in determining the deductible amount of "success-based
fees". The Purchasers shall submit each of the Pre-Closing Returns, along with
supporting workpapers, to the Sellers for review at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for the filing of such return(s), taking into account
any extensions (or, in the event that

      
 

 



 

the filing due date is within thirty (30) days of the end of the relevant
taxable period, as soon as practicable before the required filing date). The
Sellers shall have the right to review and comment on each Pre-Closing Return
prior to the filing of such Pre-Closing Return and shall provide any comments
to Purchasers no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the filing due date of
such Pre-Closing Return, provided that in the case of a Pre-Closing Return
that is due within thirty (30) days of the end of the relevant taxable period,
such comments shall be provided as soon as practicable before the required
filing due date. If the Sellers and the Purchasers are unable to agree with
respect to comments made by the Sellers, the Sellers and the Purchasers shall
submit any such dispute to the Dispute Resolution Accountants which shall
resolve any such dispute and the decision of the Dispute Resolution
Accountants shall be final, conclusive and binding. If the Dispute Resolution
Accountants are unable to resolve the dispute at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the filing due date of the Tax Return at issue, such Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by the Purchasers, subject to subsequent amendment as may
be necessary to reflect the decision of the Dispute Resolution Accountants and
the obligations of the parties hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted. The
fees and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Accountants shall be paid one-half
by the Sellers and one-half by the Purchasers. The Sellers shall pay all Taxes
shown due and payable on a Pre-Closing Return to or as directed by the
Purchasers, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected as a liability
in Net Working Capital, in which case the Purchasers shall pay or cause to be
paid those Taxes to such extent to the appropriate Governmental Entity.

 



 

(b) The Purchasers shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared and timely
filed all Stand-Alone Returns relating to Taxes with respect to a period
beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ ") (collectively, the " _Purchaser Returns_ ") (for the
avoidance of doubt, such Purchaser Returns shall not include any Tax Return
filed by a consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated group that includes
the Sellers or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand). All such Purchaser Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with the past practice of such Company or Company
Subsidiary, as may be the case, except as otherwise required under Applicable
Law. The Purchasers shall submit to Sellers a copy of each of the Purchaser
Returns, along with supporting workpapers, and, if applicable, a statement
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Purchaser Return that is allocable
to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.6(c)_, together with appropriate
supporting information and schedules at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date for the filing of such return, taking into account any extensions (or
in the event that the filing due date is within thirty (30) days of the end of
the relevant taxable period, as soon as practicable before the filing date).
The Sellers shall have the right to review and comment on each Purchaser
Return prior to the filing of such Purchaser Return and shall provide any
comments to Purchasers no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the filing due
date of such Purchaser Return, provided that in the case of a Purchaser Return
that is due within thirty (30) days of the end of the relevant taxable period,
such comments shall be provided as soon as practicable before the required
filing due date. If the Sellers and the Purchasers are unable to agree with
respect to comments made by the Sellers, the Sellers and the Purchasers shall
submit any such dispute to the Dispute Resolution Accountants which shall
resolve any such dispute and the decision of the Dispute Resolution
Accountants shall be final, conclusive and binding. If the Dispute Resolution
Accountants are unable to resolve the dispute at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the filing due date of the Purchaser Return at issue, such Purchaser
Return shall be filed as prepared by the

      
 

 



 

Purchasers, subject to subsequent amendment as may be necessary to reflect the
decision of the Dispute Resolution Accountants and the obligations of the
parties hereunder shall be appropriately adjusted. The fees and expenses of
the Dispute Resolution Accountants shall be paid one-half by the Sellers and
one-half by the Purchasers The Purchasers shall pay or cause to be paid all
Taxes shown due and payable on a Purchaser Return to the appropriate
Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that the Sellers shall pay to or as directed
by the Purchasers such Taxes as are allocable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date, as determined in accordance with _Section
7.6(c)_ (except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected as a liability in
Net Working Capital).

 



 

(c) If any Company or Company Subsidiary is permitted under any Applicable Law
to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, the Sellers and
the Purchasers shall treat (and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective Affiliates to treat) the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period. For all purposes under this Agreement, in the case of Taxes
that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such
Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the close of the
Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are (x) based upon or
related to (actual or deemed) income or receipts or (y) employment, social
security or other similar taxes, deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date and all degrouping or
deconsolidation charges (including for the avoidance of doubt as a result of
any deemed disposal or realization at Closing) were incurred in such taxable
year ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes,
including property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period. Any credit or refund resulting from an
overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the
method employed in this _Section 7.6(c)_ taking into account the type of Tax
to which such credit or refund relates. None of the parties hereto shall take
any position (whether in audits, on any Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the foregoing unless required to do so by Applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The Sellers and the Purchasers shall, upon written request of the other,
at any time and from time to time (i) provide the other and its Affiliates,
and the Purchasers shall cause each Company and Company Subsidiary to provide
the Sellers, with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by any of
them in connection with the preparation and timely execution of any Tax Return
(including extensions thereof), audit or other examination by any taxing
authority or judicial or administrative proceedings or otherwise relating to
liability for Taxes of any Company, any Company Subsidiary, Sellers or any
Affiliate thereof, (ii) retain and provide the other and its Affiliates, and
the Purchasers shall cause each Company and its Subsidiaries to retain and
provide the Sellers with, any records or other information that may be
relevant to such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or
determination, and (iii) provide the other with any final determination of any
such audit or examination, proceeding, or determination that affects any
amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other or any Company or
Company Subsidiary for any tax period or portion thereof ending on the Closing
Date and any Straddle Period. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Purchasers shall retain, and shall cause each Company and
Company Subsidiary to retain, and

      
 

 



 

the Sellers shall retain, until the applicable statutes of limitations
(including any extensions) have expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting
work schedules, and other records or information that may be relevant to such
returns for all Tax periods or portions thereof ending before or including the
Closing Date and shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records
without first providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and copy the same. Each party shall bear its own expenses in complying
with the foregoing provisions.

 



 

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
similar Taxes and fees including, without limitation, any interest, penalties
or additions thereto (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with this
Agreement (but for the avoidance of doubt excluding Transfer Taxes payable in
connection with the Seller Reorganization) shall be paid one-half by Sellers
and one-half by Purchasers when due, and the Purchasers will file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and, if required by Applicable Laws, the Sellers will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The parties
shall take any reasonable action that may be available to reduce or eliminate
any Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(f) Except to the extent taken into account in the final determination of Net
Working Capital or resulting from a post-Closing tax attribute, any Tax
refunds or overpayments of Taxes actually received by, or credited to, any
Company or Company Subsidiary or any Purchaser that relate to any taxable
period of such Company or Company Subsidiary ending on or before the Closing
Date or, in the case of a Straddle Period of such Company or Company
Subsidiary, allocable to the portion of the taxable period up to and including
the Closing Date (determined in accordance with _Section 7.6(c_)) shall be
for the account of the Sellers and the Purchasers shall pay or cause such
Company or Company Subsidiary or their Affiliates to pay to the appropriate
Sellers any such refund or overpayment (net of any Income Taxes incurred with
respect to the receipt or realization of such overpayment) by wire transfer of
immediately funds to the account(s) designated by the Sellers within ten (10)
days after receipt or credit thereof.

 



 

(g) Each Purchaser agrees that it will not take any action, or cause any
Company or Company Subsidiary to take any action, on the Closing Date, which
would increase the amount of Taxes of any Company or Company Subsidiary for
the period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (other
than actions in the ordinary course of the business consistent with past
practice or any action contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

(h) Each Party hereto hereby waives compliance by each Company and the Sellers
with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" and similar laws of
any State or political subdivision.

 



 

(i) Sellers and Purchasers agree that no election shall be made under Section
336(e), Section 338(g) or Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the
sale of the Dutch Securities under this Agreement, nor shall any similar
elections be made under applicable state, local or foreign law. Hill Delaware
and US Purchaser agree that a joint election shall be made under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any analogous state, local or foreign law) with
respect to the sale of the US Securities under this Agreement and the Hill
Delaware Company and its US Subsidiaries (the " _Section 338(h)(10)
Election_"). Hill Delaware and US Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in
the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. US Purchaser shall

      
 

 



 

prepare IRS Form 8023 and all attachments required to be filed therewith
pursuant to applicable United States Treasury regulations including Form 8883
(and any analogous state, local or foreign forms) (the " _Election Forms_ ")
consistent with _Section 1.4(h)(iv)_ and shall deliver such Election Forms to
Hill Delaware no later than one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date if the Closing occurs in 2017 and one-hundred and twenty (120)
days after the Closing Date if the Closing occurs in 2016 for Hill Delawares
review and comment. Each party shall duly execute (or cause its common parent
to duly execute) the Election Forms as necessary under applicable law to
effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall timely file the Election
Forms with the appropriate taxing authority. Hill Delaware and US Purchaser
shall report the purchase and sale of the US Securities consistently with the
Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position inconsistent therewith
in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any taxing authority or otherwise.

 



 

(j) Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, under _Section 7.6(a)_, or
in settlement of a Tax audit or similar proceeding initiated by a Governmental
Entity, neither Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, any amended Tax
Return filed for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date ("
_Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") or any Straddle Period or file any original Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to any Company or Company
Subsidiary, without prior written consent of the Sellers (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(k) Subject to _Section 7.6(i)_, each Purchaser agrees that it will not, or
cause any Company or Company Subsidiary to, make, revoke or modify any Tax
election of the Company or any Company Subsidiary made before the date of this
Agreement with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period to
the extent such action would increase any Sellers liability (including under
this Agreement) or reduce a Tax attribute of the Seller or any Affiliate
thereof, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, under _Section 7.6(a)
or (b)_, in settlement of a Tax audit or similar proceeding initiated by a
Governmental Authority or with prior written consent of the Sellers (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(l) The Sellers, at the Sellers expense, shall timely prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns, other than Stand-Alone Returns, of
each Company or Company Subsidiary or in which a Company or Company Subsidiary
is required to be included for any Taxable period or portion thereof ending on
the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the past practice with respect to such Company or Company
Subsidiary, as the case may be, except as otherwise required under Applicable
Law. The Sellers shall pay all Taxes shown due and payable on such Tax
Returns, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected as a liability in
Net Working Capital.

 



 

7.7 _Tax Contests_.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, the Purchasers shall promptly notify in writing the
Sellers, upon receipt by the Purchasers, any Company or Company Subsidiary of
written notice of any Tax Proceeding (i) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period or (ii) with respect to Taxes, which, if pursued
successfully, would reasonably be expected to serve as a basis for an
indemnity claim under _Section 8.2(a)_ (such Tax Proceeding referred to as a
" _Tax_

      
 

 



 

 _Claim_ "); _provided_ , that the failure to give such notice will not affect
the Purchasers right to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_, except to
the extent any Seller is actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(b) In the case of a Tax Claim (other than a Tax Claim that relates to a
Straddle Period with respect to a Stand-Alone Return or a taxable period of
the Company or a Company Subsidiary beginning after the Closing Date), the
Sellers shall have the right, at their expense, to control the conduct of the
Tax Claim; the Purchasers may also, at their expense, participate in, but not
control, any such Tax Claim that is solely related to a Stand-Alone Return
and, if the Sellers do not assume the defense of a Tax Claim, the Purchasers
may defend the same in such manner as they may deem appropriate (but only
after written notice to Sellers of such Purchaser(s) intention to defend such
Tax Claim). In the case of a Tax Claim that relates to a Straddle Period with
respect to a Stand-Alone Return or a taxable period of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary beginning after the Closing Date), the Purchasers shall
have the right to control the Tax Claim; the Sellers may also, at their
expense, participate in, but not control, any such Tax Claim and, if the
Purchasers do not assume the defense of any such Tax Claim, the Sellers may
defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate (but only after
written notice to Purchasers of such Seller(s) intention to defend such Tax
Claim).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.7_, neither
any Purchaser nor any Seller shall, and no party shall cause any Company or
Company Subsidiary to, enter into any compromise or agree to settle any Tax
Proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or
would reasonably be expected to serve as a basis for a Tax Claim without the
prior written consent of the other party, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that a Seller shall
not need the Purchasers prior written consent to settle or compromise any Tax
Proceeding or Tax Claim with respect to Taxes that are determined on a
consolidated, combined, unitary, affiliated or similar basis with respect to
any group of which any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller (other than the
Company or any Company Subsidiary) is the common parent provided such
settlement or compromise has no material adverse effect for any post-Closing
Tax period or portion thereof.

 



 

(d) In the event of a conflict between this _Section 7.7_ and _Section 8.6_
( _Defense of Third Party Claims_ ), this _Section 7.7_ shall control.

 



 

7.8 _Wrong Pockets_. If, on or following the Closing, any party receives any
Cash or other payments which (after taking into account the terms of this
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Steps Memo and the
documentation relating to the Seller Reorganization) are properly due directly
or indirectly to another party, any Company, or any Company Subsidiary (such
amounts being a " _Wrong Pocket Amount_ "), the relevant party which is
directly or indirectly in receipt of the Wrong Pocket Amount shall, as soon as
is reasonably practicable, transfer (or cause the transfer of) the Wrong
Pocket Amount to the appropriate Person for no consideration. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the
Steps Memo and the documentation relating to the Seller Reorganization, if on
or following the Closing, any party holds or receives any asset which relates
or is attributable, exclusively, to another party, any Company, or any Company
Subsidiary (such assets being a " _Wrong Pocket Asset_ "), the relevant party
which holds the Wrong Pocket Asset shall as soon as is reasonably practicable,
transfer (or cause the transfer of)

      
 

 



 

the Wrong Pocket Asset to the appropriate Person for no consideration
including: (a) executing all such agreements or documents as may be necessary
for the purpose of transferring the relevant interest in such asset to such
Person and (b) if any third party consent or approval is required for the
transfer of a particular asset to be effective or lawful, using reasonable
efforts to obtain such consent or approval as soon as reasonably practicable.

 



 

7.9 _Cross-Guarantees; Bonding_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Purchasers hereby agree to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Seller Indemnified Party from any against any
and all Losses from any action, or failure to take action, of any Company or
any Company Subsidiary after the Closing where such action or failure to act
is the subject of (i) any guaranty given by any member of the Seller Group
(each, a " _Seller Guaranty_ ") or (ii) any liability of any member of the
Seller Group in respect of any letter of credit or bond (including the ongoing
costs of such letter of credit or bond arising after Closing) given by any
bank or financial institution in respect of the obligations of any Company or
Company Subsidiary as set forth on _Schedule 7.9_ (each, a " _Seller Bond_ "
and, together with each Seller Guaranty, a " _Seller Obligation_ "). As soon
as possible following the Closing, but no later than six (6) months
thereafter, the Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
request of each counterparty to any Seller Obligation that each member of the
Seller Group be released as a guarantor or obligor thereunder and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such removal of each such member of
the Seller Group such that the counterparty of each Seller Obligation releases
in full each member of the Seller Group. The Purchasers shall not renew,
amend, restate or extend any Seller Obligation unless the underlying guaranty,
bond, letter of credit or other obligation ceases to apply to such amended,
restated or extended Seller Obligation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Sellers hereby agree to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Purchaser Indemnified Party from any against any and
all Losses from any action, or failure to take action, of any member of the
Seller Group after the Closing where such action or failure to act is the
subject of (i) any guaranty given by any Company or Company Subsidiarity
(each, a " _Purchaser Guaranty_ ") or (ii) any liability of any Company or
Company Subsidiarity in respect of any letter of credit or bond (including the
ongoing costs of such letter of credit or bond arising after Closing) given by
any bank or financial institution in respect of the obligations of any member
of the Seller Group (each, a " _Purchaser Bond_ " and, together with each
Purchaser Guaranty, a " _Purchaser Obligation_ "). As soon as possible
following the Closing, but no later than six (6) months thereafter, the
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to request of each
counterparty to any Purchaser Obligation that each Company and Company
Subsidiary be released as a guarantor or obligor thereunder and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such removal of each Company and
Company Subsidiary such that the counterparty of each Purchaser Obligation
releases in full each member of the Purchaser Group. The Sellers shall not
renew, amend, restate or extend any Purchaser Obligation unless the underlying
guaranty, bond, letter of credit or other obligation ceases to apply to such
amended, restated or extended Purchaser Obligation.

 



 

7.10 _Litigation Matters_. From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall pay
over (or cause to be paid over) to the Purchasers any and all proceeds,
receivables, property, cash, and other consideration payable to, or on behalf
of, any Seller or any member of the Seller Group in

      
 

 



 

connection with the matters listed on _Schedule 7.10_ (the " _Litigation
Matters_ "), whether by suit, judgment, settlement, or otherwise)
(collectively, " _Litigation Proceeds_ ") promptly following receipt thereof
by the Sellers or, as the case may be, such members of the Seller Group;
provided, that the calculation of Litigation Proceeds payable hereunder will
take into consideration and shall be reduced by (i) any non-recoverable Taxes
payable by the Sellers in respect of the Litigation Proceeds, (ii) setoffs of
any kind, including setoffs in respect of any claim or counterclaim asserted
against any Seller by any Person, and (iii) any unpaid costs and expenses
relating to such Litigation Matter. From and after the Closing, the Purchasers
shall promptly following delivery of the relevant invoice or receipt reimburse
the Sellers for all reasonable and properly incurred costs and expenses
relating to the Litigation Matters, including, without limitation, all legal,
expert and other professional fees and costs.

 



 

7.11 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing, as and when
requested by any party hereto, any other party shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such
requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the transactions contemplated by the Steps Memo).

 



 

7.12 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

(a) The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for purposes of convenience in
separately titled sections corresponding to the sections of _Article 3_. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) matters reflected in the Disclosure
Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required to be reflected
therein, (ii) the disclosure by the Sellers of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by the Sellers
that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or
that the matter is material, (iii) if any section of the Disclosure Schedules
lists an item or information in such a way as to make its relevance to the
disclosure required by or provided in another section of the Disclosure
Schedules or the statements contained in any Section this Agreement reasonably
apparent, the matter shall be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect
to such other Section, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-
reference to such other Section or the omission of a reference in the
particular representation and warranty to such section of the Disclosure
Schedule, (iv) except as provided in clause (iii) above, to the extent that
headings have been inserted in the Disclosure Schedules, such headings have
been inserted for convenience of reference only, (v) the Disclosure Schedules
are qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of this
Agreement, and (vi) the Disclosure Schedules and the information and
statements contained therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the Sellers except
as and to the extent provided in this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a possible
breach or violation of, or default under, any contract, arrangement or
understanding, Applicable Law or order shall be construed as an admission or
indication that breach, violation or default exists or has actually occurred.
All references to this Agreement herein or in any of the Disclosure Schedules
shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement, including all Disclosure
Schedules. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not
otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.

       
 

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or
amend the Disclosure Schedules hereto with respect to any matter (i) arising
after the date hereof and prior to the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) which was not known by the Sellers would
arise as at the date of this Agreement (each a " _Schedule Supplement_ "). Any
disclosure in any such Schedule Supplement shall not be deemed to have cured
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement and given as at the date of this Agreement, including for
purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in
_Section 2.2(b)_ have been satisfied; _provided_ , that if the Purchasers
have the right to, but do not elect to, terminate this Agreement within
fifteen (15) Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule Supplement, then
the Purchasers shall (in respect only of any such matter which arises in the
ordinary course of business and which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect) be deemed to have irrevocably waived their right to terminate this
Agreement with respect to such matter and, further, shall have irrevocably
waived their right to indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ with respect to
such matter.

 



 

7.13 _Conflicts; Privileges_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties that
the Companies and the Sellers have retained Duane Morris LLP (" _DM_ ") to act
as their United States counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that DM has not acted as counsel for any other Person
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that no other
party or Person has the status of a client of DM for conflict of interest or
any other purposes as a result thereof. Each Purchaser hereby agrees that, in
the event that a dispute arises between such Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Company or Company Subsidiary)
and any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, any Company or Company Subsidiary), DM may represent such Seller or
any such Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of such Seller or
such Affiliate may be directly adverse to such Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Company or Company Subsidiary),
and even though DM may have represented any Company or Company Subsidiary in a
matter substantially related to such dispute, and such Purchaser and each
Company hereby waive, on behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates,
(i) any claim they have or may have that DM has a conflict of interest in
connection with or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation, (ii) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between such Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, any Company or Company Subsidiary) and any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates, DM may represent any such party if retained in such
dispute even though the interest of any such party may be directly adverse to
such Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any
Company or Company Subsidiary); _provided_ , that DM shall not represent such
party without the prior written consent of such Purchaser (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) if DM has represented any
Company or Company Subsidiary in a matter substantially related to such
dispute. Each Purchaser further agrees that, as to all communications among
DM, any Company or Company Subsidiary and any Seller or any of their
Affiliates that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence
and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the Sellers and
may be controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by such
Purchaser or any Company or Company Subsidiary. Each Purchaser agrees to take,
and to cause its Affiliates to take, all steps reasonably necessary to
implement the

      
 

 



 

intent of this _Section 7.13_. The Sellers, each Company and the Purchasers
further agree that DM is a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 7.13_.

material notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) the

Closing set forth in _Section 2.2_ would not be satisfied and (ii) any
failure of any Seller, Company, or Company Subsidiary to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder such that the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
2.2_ would not be satisfied. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.14(b)_ shall not (x) limit or otherwise affect any remedies

(c) The Purchasers shall give prompt notice to the Sellers of (i) the

(i) this Agreement shall not in any manner restrict the Companies and/or their
respective Subsidiaries from engaging in the Seller Reorganization (except as

of the Sellers in this Agreement; (iii) any newly-formed and directly wholly
owned Subsidiary of Hill Delaware that is formed in connection with the Seller
Reorganization and that, directly or indirectly through one or more of its

the Purchasers will cause the account balances of the employees of each
Company and Company Subsidiary (determined as of the Closing Date) under the
Hill International, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (" _Hill 401(k)
Plan_") to be transferred to a newly established 401(k) defined contribution
plan of the Purchasers or an Affiliate of the Purchasers in a plan-to-plan
transfer that satisfies the requirements of Applicable Law, including, without
limitation, Section 414(l) of the Code. The Sellers and the Purchasers will

(b) notify the relevant insurers of all claims and known incidents with
respect to the period prior to Closing which could result in a claim under the

shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to implement the Stage Two IT Separation as
soon as commercially practicable following the Closing and in a manner which
reasonably ensures no material adverse impact on the operations of the

other than those which by their terms contemplate performance after the
Closing Date, and each such surviving covenant and agreement shall survive the
Closing for the period contemplated by its terms. No Person shall be liable
for any claim for indemnification under this _Article 8_ unless written
notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the claim for

under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any corresponding or similar

included in any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group at any time
prior to Closing, (B) as a result of any Company or Company Subsidiary ceasing
to be part of any group for Tax purposes at Closing (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any deemed disposal or realisation on so ceasing), or
otherwise being related or associated for any relevant Tax purposes with any
Seller Group entity other than any other Company or Company Subsidiary at any
time prior to Closing, or (C) as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise, which transferee or successor status existed or arose prior to the
Closing;

occupied by any Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise used in
connection with the Business in the period prior to the Closing,

 



 

 _provided_ , that (x) no claims shall be so asserted under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would
otherwise be payable hereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal
to $1,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses
exceed the Deductible, (y) the Sellers shall not be liable for any Loss or

Fundamental Representations shall not be subject to the foregoing limits and
shall not be included in the determination of whether the limit in clause (z)
has been reached. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the
aggregate liability of the Sellers for indemnification payable hereunder with
respect to all claims under _Sections 8.2(a)_ exceed the Base Price, provided
that the maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers for claims under _Section
8.2(a)(ix)(B)_ shall not exceed $25,000 and for claims under _Section
8.2(a)(xii)_ shall not exceed $500,000;

 



 

Notwithstanding the limitations on indemnification set forth in _Section
8.2(a)_, such limitations shall not apply to any fraud or willful
misrepresentation. For purposes of _Section 8.2(a)(i)_: (A) when determining
whether a representation or warranty of a Seller or a Company or a Company
Subsidiary has been breached or is inaccurate, and the amount of any Losses
related thereto, any Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifier
(other than in the term "Material Contract") contained in any such
representation or warranty will be disregarded, other than any such qualifier
that appears in all capital letters (i.e., "MATERIAL" or "MATERIAL

      
 

 



 

Adverse Effect"), which shall continue to be given effect and shall not be
disregarded; and (B) when calculating the amount of any Losses relating to
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_, such Losses shall be reduced to the extent and provided
that (1) the facts and circumstances giving rise to such breach were actually
known, as evidenced by records or documents (including e-mail), by either Alan
Payne or Steve Bonnard prior to the date of this Agreement, (2) either Alan
Payne or Steve Bonnard understood that such facts and circumstances
constituted a breach of such representations and warranties in respect of
which an indemnification claim could be brought by the Purchaser under
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (it being understood that such individuals shall be
deemed to have read this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules hereto
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement), and (3) such facts and
circumstances were not within the Sellers Knowledge at any time prior to the
date hereof.

 



 

Notwithstanding the limitations on indemnification set forth in this _Section
8.2(a)_, each Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser
Indemnified Party, acknowledges and agrees that the sole and exclusive remedy
of any Purchaser Indemnified Party beyond the Cap for any claim pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)(i)_ (other than with respect to any claim arising from the
breach of a Fundamental Representation or any claim for fraud or willful
misrepresentation) shall be to make a claim against the RandW Policy (if, for
the avoidance of doubt such a policy is, in the Purchasers absolute
discretion incepted). Each Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other
Purchaser Indemnified Party, further acknowledges and agrees that the
provisions of the foregoing sentence shall apply regardless if (i) such
Purchaser obtains at or following Closing or maintains following Closing the
RandW Policy, (ii) the RandW Policy is revoked, cancelled or modified in any
manner after issuance, or (iii) any Purchaser Indemnified Party makes a claim
under the RandW Policy and such claim is denied by the insurer of the RandW Policy
for any reason, including, but not limited to, a situation where a claim is
covered but full indemnity is not granted due to erosion or exhaustion of
limits. Each Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser
Indemnified Party, further acknowledges and agrees that in no event may the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties recover amounts from the Sellers and pursuant to
the RandW Policy aggregating an amount (net of Taxes) in excess of its Losses
with respect to such claim, and any such excess amounts received by any such
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall promptly be paid over to the Sellers.

(including without limitation _Section 5.1_ and _Section 6.1_), the rights
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ (including,

exhibit or schedules hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder, except to
the extent that a Purchaser Indemnified Party suffers Losses as a result of

entitled to additional relief and

      
 

 



 

remedies otherwise available; _provided_ , that the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may seek injunctive relief in connection with any actual or threatened
breach of this Agreement.

Parties or any Company or Company Subsidiary or their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any officer, director, employee (present or former)
or Affiliate of any party hereto which is not otherwise expressly identified

them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy
in or breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of any

schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall have no right to any indemnification under this _Article 8_ for
any matter to the extent that (i) recovery for Losses with respect to such
matter would be duplicative of any adjustment made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 1.5_ or was otherwise fully taken into account as a
liability in the Net Working Capital or (ii) the Purchasers disputed such
matter and the dispute was resolved in favor of the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 1.5_.

 



 

8.3 _Indemnification by the Purchasers for the Benefit of the Sellers_. The
Purchasers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Seller and their respective Affiliates, and their respective officers,
managers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses arising out of or relating to
any breach or nonfulfillment of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of or by such Purchaser under this Agreement or any claim or suit
brought against any of the Seller Indemnified Parties at any time on or after
the Effective Time relating to actions or omissions (or failure to take
action) by any Purchaser or any Company or Company Subsidiary on or after the
Effective Time.

 



 

8.4 _Payment of Claims_. Subject to the limitations on indemnification set
forth in _Section 8.2_, any and all claims by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
for Losses pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ shall be satisfied (i) first, from
the Indemnity Escrow Amount and, thereafter, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds by the Sellers to the account(s) designated by the Purchasers,
_provided_ , that the aggregate amount of funds delivered pursuant to this
clause (i) shall not exceed the Cap and (ii) second, from and against the RandW
Policy (if any). To the extent that such Losses relate to a claim for breach
of a Fundamental Representation or a claim for fraud or willful
misrepresentation that are not satisfied in full pursuant to clauses (i) and
(ii), in the aggregate, then by wire transfer of immediately available funds
by the Sellers to the account(s) designated by the Purchasers. Any and all
claims by a Purchaser Indemnified Party for Losses pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(ii)_- _(xii)_ shall be satisfied first, from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount and, thereafter, by wire transfer of immediately available funds by the
Sellers to the account(s) designated by the Purchasers. If any Seller has not
satisfied any indemnification obligation owed by it hereunder and the
Indemnity Escrow Amount has been released or disbursed in its entirety, except
to the extent Losses related to such indemnification obligation are covered by
the RandW Policy (if any) pursuant to the process set out in _Section 8.2_, the
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates may, at their discretion,
satisfy the unpaid portion of such obligation by, to the extent permitted by
law, setting-off against any amounts due and

      
 

 



 

owing from a Purchaser Indemnified Party to a Seller, including any amounts
due under or in respect of the Transition Services Agreement and/or the
Employee Services Agreement.

 



 

8.5 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



 

8.6 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. Any Person making a claim for
indemnification under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ")
shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in
writing promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing the
claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof;
_provided_ , that the failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent
(and only to the extent) that the Indemnitor is actually and materially
prejudiced by the failure of the Indemnitee to provide such prompt notice. Any
Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action,
lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an
Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at
its option shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a
reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead
counsel in connection with such defense and providing notice to the Indemnitee
that the Indemnitor will be responsible for Losses in connection with such
claim; _provided_ , that any Indemnitor shall continue to be entitled to
assert any limitation on any claims described herein. If the Indemnitor
assumes control of the defense of any claim, (i) the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose at its sole expense and (ii) the Indemnitee may
take over the defense and prosecution of a claim from the Indemnitor if the
Indemnitor has failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such
claim. Further, the Indemnitor may not assume the defense of any claim if a
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee that
precludes effective joint representation or the amount of any claim exceeds or
reasonably could exceed the limits of indemnification acknowledged by the
Indemnitor. The Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates may assume
the defense and otherwise deal with any claim in good faith, with counsel of
its choice, indemnified to the extent set forth in _Article 8_ therefor at
any time when (i) a Purchaser believes in good faith that any claim is having
or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on any
Purchaser, the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, or (ii) a Purchaser
believes that a claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal matter. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any
such claim then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim;
_provided_ , that the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend
such claim unless such settlement agreement unconditionally releases the
Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim,
without prejudice, except for payments of money damages by the Indemnitor that
are paid in full by the Indemnitor; _provided_ , that, if the Indemnitee does
not consent to any proposed settlement, then the Indemnitee shall not be
entitled to any indemnification or other payment hereunder for Losses incurred
after such date in excess of the proposed settlement with respect to such
claim whether or not the Indemnitee was otherwise

       
 

 



 

entitled to indemnification hereunder. The parties will cooperate fully with
each other in connection with the defense of any claim by a third party.

 



 

8.7 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ shall be calculated net
of (i) any Tax Benefit actually received by the Indemnitee or any of its
Affiliates on account of such Loss in the year in which the applicable claim
is made or the immediately following year and (ii) any insurance proceeds (net
of direct collection expenses and Taxes) actually received by the Indemnitee
with respect thereto. If the Indemnitee receives a Tax Benefit on account of
any Loss after an indemnification payment is made to it with respect to such
Loss but within the timeframe set forth in clause (i) of the foregoing
sentence, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor the amount of
such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax
Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes of this _Section
8.7_, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes paid or credit against
or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, net
of Taxes (without duplication of any Taxes taken into account under clause (i)
of this _Section 8.7_) and any costs or expenses in obtaining such Tax
Benefit. In the event that an insurance recovery is made by any Indemnitee
with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall
be made promptly to the Indemnitor.

 



 

8.8 _Waiver_. From and after the Closing, each Purchaser agrees, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, that, with respect to this
Agreement: (i) no Affiliate of the Sellers, or any of the Sellers or their
Affiliates respective directors, managers, officers, employees, equity
holders, members, partners, successors, assigns, Affiliates, agents, advisors
or representatives or their heirs, shall have any liability or responsibility
whatsoever to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, managers, officers, equity holders, members, partners,
employees, Affiliates, successors, assigns, agents, advisors or
representatives or their heirs; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the foregoing limitation shall not limit or otherwise affect the Sellers
indemnification and other obligations under this Agreement, the Transition
Services Agreement, the Employee Services Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby.

 



 

8.9 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments made
hereunder shall be treated for all purposes as adjustments to the Purchase
Price.

 



 

8.10 _Double Claims_. If the same fact, matter, event or circumstance gives
rise to more than one claim under any of the provisions of this Agreement,
neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall be entitled to recover more than
once in respect of the same loss.

 



 

8.11 _Provisions Relating to Indemnity Letter of Credit_. In the event of a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_, the Escrow Agent may
only draw upon the Indemnity Letter of Credit when (i) joint written
instructions of the Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Sellers are delivered
to the Escrow Agent, or (ii) a final non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction has conclusively determined that the Sellers are
obligated to indemnify a Purchaser Indemnified Party (in which case the
Sellers shall execute a joint instruction providing for the draw of funds by
the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party).

11.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns (and, as applicable, heirs and
legal beneficiaries), except that neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any
Seller without the prior written consent of the Purchasers nor, prior to the
Closing, by any Purchaser without the prior written consent of the Sellers
(other than a collateral assignment to the Lenders). For the avoidance of
doubt, no consent shall be required for an assignment as of or following the
Closing (a) of the indemnification and other rights hereunder of a Purchaser
to any bank or other Person which is or becomes a lender (or any agent
thereof) to any Purchaser, any Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or

portion of the assets, business or securities of Hill Delaware or any Seller,
whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or securities or otherwise.

 



 

11.5 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under Applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

11.6 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other headings
and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto are solely
for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties
hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days or months shall be
deemed references to calendar days or months. All references to "$" shall be
deemed references to United States dollars. Unless the context otherwise
requires, any reference to a "Section," "Exhibit," "Disclosure Schedule" or
"Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a section of this Agreement, exhibit to
this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as

      
 

 



 

applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. English shall be the governing
language of this Agreement. Unless context requires otherwise, the word
"including" shall mean "including, without limitation".

 



 

11.7 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. The information contained in this Agreement and in the
Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall be deemed
to be an admission by any party hereto to any third party of any matter
whatsoever (including, without limitation, any violation of law or breach of
Contract).

 



 

11.8 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedules or Exhibits hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
by the Purchasers and the Sellers; provided, that, any amendment of _Section
9.3_, _Section 11.10_, _Section 11.11_, _Section 11.16_, _Section 11.17_
or this _Section 11.8_ that in any way materially adversely affects the
rights of the Debt Financing Sources shall not be effective without the prior
written consent of the Debt Financing Sources. Each of the Debt Financing
Sources is an express third party beneficiary of the preceding sentence. No
waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall
extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or subsequent
breach or default. No failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or remedy.

 



 

11.9 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and
Schedules) and the documents referred to herein contain the complete agreement
between the parties hereto and supersede any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have
related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

 



 

11.10 _Guarantees of Obligations; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. For and in
consideration of the premises, and with full knowledge that the Purchasers are
relying hereon and would not have entered into this Agreement but for this
provision, Hill Delaware hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the
prompt performance and payment by each member of the Sellers of each and all
of their respective obligations under this Agreement and the other agreements,
documents and instruments contemplated hereby. Except as expressly set forth
herein, including, without limitation, the rights conferred upon the Debt
Financing Sources pursuant to _Section 9.3_, _Section 11.8_, _Section
11.11_, _Section 11.16_, _Section 11.17_, nothing in this Agreement will be
construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any
legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. In furtherance, and not in
limitation, of the foregoing, this Agreement shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon the insurer of the RandW Policy.

       
 

 



 

11.11 _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION INVOLVING THE
FINANCING AND/OR WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT FINANCING AND/OR ANY DEBT COMMITMENT

EXPRESS THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THIS _SECTION 11.11_ SOLELY WITH RESPECT
TO ANY LITIGATION INVOLVING THE FINANCING AND/OR WITH RESPECT TO THE DEBT
FINANCING AND/OR ANY DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND/OR ANY OF THE DEBT FINANCING
SOURCES.

11.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or PDF_. This Agreement and any signed agreement
entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile
machine or electronically transmitted portable document format (or similar),
shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and shall
be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such
contract shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or electronic transmission
in portable document format (or similar) to deliver a signature or the fact
that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use
of facsimile machine or electronic transmission in portable document format as
a defense to the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

 



 

11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

beroeps- en gedragsregels_ ) established by the Royal Notarial Professional
Organisation ( _Koninklijke Notari ele Beroepsorganisatie_), the parties
hereby explicitly agree (i) that the Notary shall execute any notarial deeds
related to this Agreement and (ii) that the Sellers are assisted and
represented by, _inter alia_ , Loyens and Loeff N.V., in relation to this
Agreement and any agreements that may be concluded, or disputes that may

11.16 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably agrees
that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any agreements or transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware and hereby expressly submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue
of such court for the purposes thereof and expressly waives any claim of
improper venue and any claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum. This
provision may be filed with any court as written evidence of the knowing and
voluntary irrevocable agreement between the parties to waive any objections to
jurisdiction, to venue or to convenience of forum. Each party hereby
irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of the aforementioned
court in any such suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the address set forth or
referred to in _Section 11.3_. Any legal action or proceeding with respect to
the Facilities Agreement or the Debt Financing and any action for enforcement
of any judgement in respect thereof shall be brought in a federal court
located within the County of New York in the State of New York, and any
appellate court from any such court, and, by the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the parties hereby accept for themselves and in respect of
their property, generally and unconditionally, the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts and appellate courts. Each of the Debt Financing Sources
is an express third party beneficiary of this _Section 11.16_ solely with
respect to any legal action or proceeding with respect to the Facilities
Agreement or the Debt Financing and any action for enforcement of any
judgement in respect thereof.

 



 

11.17 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of the parties hereto expressly agrees that none of the Debt Financing
Sources will have any liability or obligation to the Companies or any of their
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, any Facilities Agreement or, if applicable, any
Alternative Debt Financing, or for any claim for any loss suffered as a result
of any breach of this Agreement or any Facilities Agreement or, if applicable,
any Alternative Debt Financing (including any willful breach thereof), or the
failure of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated,
or in respect of any oral or written representation made or alleged to have
been made, in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and no Company nor any of its Affiliates will
have any direct rights or claims against any of the Debt Financing Sources
under any Facilities Agreement or, if applicable, any Alternative Debt
Financing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto expressly agrees that in no event shall any Company or any of
its Affiliates be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement or any Facilities Agreement or, if applicable, any Alternative Debt
Financing against the Debt Financing Sources; _provided_ , that nothing herein
to the contrary shall prohibit the Purchaser from enforcing its rights
directly against the Debt Financing Sources under any Facilities Agreement or,
if applicable, any Alternative Debt Financing or causing the Debt Financing
Sources to fund (including by seeking

      
 

 



 

specific performance thereunder) pursuant to any Facilities Agreement or, if
applicable, any Alternative Debt Financing. Each of the Debt Financing Sources

(a) Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall, or
shall cause its relevant Subsidiary to, assign the Secondees to those entities
specified in this _Section 1(a)_ (the " _Recipients_ ") in order to provide
such services as the Secondees are reasonably required to perform as directed
by the Recipients (the " _Services_ "):

 



 

(i) _the Interim Secondees shall be seconded:_

 



 

A. from Hill International (Middle East) Ltd (BVI) to Hill International

B. from Hill International Engineering Consultancy LLC (Oman) to Hill

E. from Hill International (Hong Kong) Ltd (Hong Hong) to James R. Knowles
(Hong Kong) Ltd., in the case of the HK Secondees; and

 



 

F. from Binnington Copeland and Associates (Pty) Ltd and BCA Training (Pty)
Ltd to SA Newco, in the case of the SA Secondees,

 



      
 

 



 

(collectively, the " _Interim Secondments_ "),

 



 

(ii) the Veteran Secondees shall be seconded: from Hill International (Middle
East) Ltd (BVI) and Hill International Engineering Consultancy LLC (Oman) to
Hill International Consulting (Middle East) Ltd (BVI) and Hill International
Construction Consultancy LLC (Oman), respectively (together, the " _Veteran
Secondments_ ")

 



 

(b) During the term of the applicable Secondment, subject to the limitations
described in _Section 1(c)_ below, the Seller shall, or shall cause its
relevant Subsidiary to, assign each Secondee to be under the exclusive control
of the appropriate Recipient, in particular in relation to the allocation and
performance of his or her duties and to be subject to the reasonable working
practices of, and to take reasonable instructions from, the Recipient.

 



 

(c) During the applicable period of the Secondment, subject to Applicable Law,
the Seller shall, or shall cause its relevant Subsidiary to, assign each
Secondee to:

 



 

(i) work such hours as are reasonably necessary to perform the Services;

 



 

(ii) work from such location(s) as shall be reasonably required by the
relevant Recipient from time to time and shall, if required, undertake such
travel, including internationally, as may be reasonably requested by the
Recipient for the proper provision of the Services; and

 



 

(iii) comply with the Recipients office rules, internal procedures and
compliance regulations, in each case as are communicated in writing by the
Recipient to the Secondees and to Seller and any relevant Subsidiary of the
Seller from time to time during the period of the applicable Secondment.

 



 

However, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
expressly agreed and understood that the Seller and its Affiliates cannot
ensure that any CCB Employee will accept their Secondment or comply with the
terms of their assignment and any CCB Employees or Secondees failure to do
so shall not in itself constitute a breach of this Agreement. Moreover, Seller
and its Affiliates shall not be required to make any Secondment or assign any
Secondee to perform Services if and to the extent they are not permitted to do
so under Applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Seller may, where the Secondees are employed or engaged by one or more of
its Subsidiaries, provide any of the Secondees through any such

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries, provided that Seller shall remain ultimately responsible for all
of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

(e) _Transfers of employment_

 



 

(i) The Parties acknowledge the transitional nature of this Agreement and the
Secondments. Accordingly, in relation to the Secondees and those of the
Veteran Secondees (if any) in respect of whom visas are obtained enabling such
Veteran Secondees to be employed or engaged directly by a Recipient, as
promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Purchasers
and Seller shall co-operate and use all reasonable efforts to transfer the
employment or engagement of each such Secondee to the relevant Recipient as
set out at _Section 1(a)(i)_ above, on terms no less favorable to the
Secondee such that the Secondee is employed or engaged by the relevant
Recipient (or its Affiliate) and is no longer employed or engaged by the
Seller Group (each such transfer being a " _Transfer_ ", the dates on which
such Transfer occurs being a " _Transfer Date_ ", any Interim Secondee who so
Transfers being a " _Transferred Interim Secondee_ " and any Veteran Secondee
who so Transfers being a " _Transferred Veteran Secondee_ ").

 



 

(ii) Seller agrees during the Term to provide Purchasers and the Recipients,
and the Purchasers and the Recipients agree during the Term to provide Seller
and its Subsidiaries, with such reasonable co-operation, together with such
data and information, as they may reasonably request to assist them with the
making of any arrangements for the Transfers.

 



 

(f) Each Party shall designate one individual to be the primary liaison
between the Parties for the provision of and the transfer of responsibility
for the Secondees (each, a " _Service Manager_ "). A Party may replace its
Service Manager at any time upon written notice to the other Party. Seller
hereby designates as its initial Service Manager and
Purchasers hereby designate as their
initial Service Manager.

 



 

 **2.** **_Term_** ** _._**

 



 

The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall expire
upon termination of the final Secondment to be terminated under _Section 3_
(the " _Term_ ").

 



 

 **3.** **_Termination._**

 



 

(a) Without prejudice to _Sections 3(c)_ and _3(d)_ below, the Secondment of
a Secondee under this Agreement shall terminate on the earlier of:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) the Transfer Date in respect of such Transferred Secondee;

 



 

(ii) subject to _Section 3(b)_ below, the earliest of the date on which the
employment or contractor relationship of such Secondee by or with any member
of the Seller Group is terminated (1) by the Seller (or its relevant
Subsidiary) for Cause, or (2) by the Secondee by reason of the Secondee giving
notice or otherwise resigning, or (3) due to the Secondees death or permanent
incapacity (in each case, the Seller shall promptly inform the Purchaser of
such termination);

 



 

(iii) in the case of the Interim Secondees, the six (6) month anniversary of
the Closing Date, or, where the Transfer of such an Interim Secondee has not
occurred by such date because (x) the necessary visa has not yet been
obtained, (y) the Recipient has not yet been formed, or (z) any approvals
required for the Transfer have not yet been obtained, the twenty-four (24)
month anniversary of the Closing Date;

 



 

(iv) in the case of Veteran Secondees, the eighteen (18) month anniversary of
the Closing Date; and

 



 

(v) such date as is specified to the Seller in writing by a Purchaser or
Recipient.

 



 

(b) Seller and its Affiliates shall not, during the period in which a Secondee
is seconded to a Recipient and without the prior written consent of (or at the
written direction of) the Recipient, terminate or take any steps to terminate
the employment or engagement of, or procure or attempt to procure the giving
of notice by, such Secondee, except (i) for " _Cause_ ", which shall mean the
refusal or failure to accept or continue an assigned Secondment to a Recipient
or to perform Services, willful misconduct, unlawful conduct, criminal
conviction, insubordination, dishonesty, fraudulent acts or omissions, or
material violation of policy; or (ii) in the event such Secondee resigns from
employment or engagement.

 



 

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller upon written notice to
Purchasers in the event Purchasers fail to make any payment as provided for in
this Agreement within [ ] ([ ]) days of when such payment is due.

 



 

(d) This Agreement may be terminated by either Party upon written notice to
the other Party (i) upon a material breach of any of the terms of this
Agreement (other than a breach covered by _Section 3(c)_) by the other Party
if such breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after written
notice of such breach is delivered by the non-breaching Party to the breaching
Party; or (ii) if such other Party files a proceeding in bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation or reorganization, or for composition,

 



      
 

 



 

liquidation or dissolution or for similar relief, or there is a filing against
such Party of any such proceeding which is not dismissed within thirty (30)
days after the filing thereof.

 



 

(e) The expiration or termination of any Secondment shall not relieve any
Party of any obligations or extinguish any rights of any Party that have
accrued to either Party prior to such expiration or termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 4_ below, Purchasers shall have no
obligation to pay any future compensation relating to a Secondee (other than
for or in respect of the Secondment of such Secondee in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement prior to such termination) where the Secondees
employment does not transfer to the Recipient under _Section 1(e)(i)_.

be entitled to terminate the employment or engagement of such Secondee and the
Purchasers will be responsible for all costs arising out of or in connection

written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) make, propose or agree to
make any material changes to the terms and conditions of employment or
engagement of any Secondee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any

changes in the ordinary course of business, or remove, redeploy or replace any
Secondee (or any person who would have been a Secondee but for their removal,
redeployment or replacement).

 



 

 **6.** **_Fees._**

 



 

(a) During the Term, Purchasers shall pay to Seller a monthly fee in an amount
equal to the sum of the following: (i) the aggregate of all Salaries payable

of all Benefits provided to or made available to the Secondees (including,
without limitation, the Secondment Gratuity Accrual in respect to such
Secondees, subject to _Section 4_) with respect to that calendar month, plus
(iii) the amount of any properly incurred Employment Costs with respect to
that calendar month, plus (iv) the amount of all reasonable and properly
allocated overhead charges for payroll administration incurred by Sellers
relating to the Secondees with respect to that calendar month (the " _Service
Fees_ ").

 



 

(b) Where the Seller is responsible for a Historic Gratuity Accrual under
_Section 4(b)(i)B_, it shall pay to Purchasers within thirty (30) days of a
demand therefor an amount equal to such Historic Gratuity Accrual.

 



 

 **7.** **_Payment Terms._**

 



 

(a) Not more than [ ] ([ ]) Business Days before the end of each
Payroll Period during the Term, Seller shall submit to Purchasers in writing
an invoice setting out in reasonable detail, by Recipient, (i) the Salaries,
(ii) the Benefits, (iii) the Employment Costs to be paid, and (iv) the amount
of allocated overhead charges to be attributable to each Secondee seconded to
the Recipient in respect of such Payroll Period and the corresponding Service
Fee for the same period.

 



 

(b) Purchasers shall (subject to _Section 7(c)_ and _Section 7(f)_) pay
Seller all invoiced charges in full promptly on receipt of each invoice, but
in no event later than [ ] ([ ]) Business Days after receipt of
the invoice, to enable Seller or the relevant Seller Subsidiary to use the
Service Fees to pay the Salaries, and Benefits to the Secondees in arrears and
pay the Employment Costs in connection therewith.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In the event that any Salaries or Benefits paid by Seller or the relevant
Seller Subsidiary are less than the equivalent amounts set out in a
corresponding invoice submitted to Purchasers pursuant to _Section 7(a)_ and,
as a result, the amount of the corresponding Service Fee paid by Purchaser
(for example and without limitation because a Secondment terminates during the
period between the date on which an invoice is issued and the date on which
the corresponding Service Fee is paid), Seller shall promptly notify the
Purchasers in writing and shall deduct such amount from the Service Fee set
out in the next practicable invoice submitted by Seller to Purchasers pursuant
to _Section 7(a)_, or, at the election of Purchasers, will repay such amount
to Purchasers within thirty (30) days and Seller shall indemnify and keep
indemnified Purchasers in full and on demand in respect of the same.

 



 

(d) In the event that a Party considers that the other Party should make a
payment to it to reflect the apportionment of responsibilities under _Section
4(a)_ and _Section 4(b)_, the former party shall promptly notify the latter
party in writing and the latter Party shall make any such payment within
thirty (30) days (except in the event that the latter Party gives the former
Party written notice of a bona fide dispute in accordance with clause 7(f)).

 



 

(e) If a Party fails to pay any charges or amounts due under this Agreement by
the date on which such charges or amounts are due, such Party shall be
obligated to pay to the other Party, in addition to the amount due, interest
from and including the date such payment is due at an interest rate of two
percent (2%) over the prime rate in effect during such period, as published in
the eastern edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ or a comparable newspaper if
_The Wall Street Journal_ shall cease publishing the prime rate. Such interest
shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall
be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days
elapsed.

 



 

(f) A Party will give the other Party written notice of any disputed charges
or other amounts due under this Agreement within ten (10) days following
receipt of the invoice (or other written notice) reflecting such charges or
amounts, along with a description of the nature of the dispute and providing
reasonable supporting evidence where practicable. If a Party fails to dispute
a charge or amount within such ten (10) day period, that Partys right to
dispute such charge or amount is automatically deemed to be waived without any
further action on the part of any Party. If a Party does dispute a charge or
amount within such ten (10) day period in accordance with this _Section
7(f)_, the Party which has received the applicable dispute notice will notify
the other Party of its determination regarding disputed charges or amounts
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the applicable dispute notice and
description and will credit the other Partys account, if appropriate, within
the fifteen (15)-day period.

 



      
 

 



 

Any dispute which is not resolved under this _Section 7(f)_ will be resolved
in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of _Section 14_.

 



 

(g) All amounts payable hereunder shall be paid in United States Dollars
except that any such amounts which correspond to Salaries, Benefits and
Employment Costs shall (where practicable) be remitted in such currencies in
which such Salaries, Benefits and Employment Costs are paid, to a bank or
other Person to be designated in an invoice or otherwise in writing by the
Seller or relevant Subsidiary of such Seller receiving such funds, unless
otherwise provided for and agreed upon in writing by the Parties, and shall be
made subject to any deduction or withholding on account of tax required by
Applicable Law.

 



 

(h) The obligations under this Agreement shall not be subject to set-off for
non-performance or any monetary or non-monetary claim by any Party or any of
their respective Affiliates under any other agreement between the Parties or
any of their respective Affiliates, including the Purchase Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

 **8.** **_Records and Documents._**

 



 

(a) Seller shall be responsible for maintaining full and accurate accounts and
records in respect of the Secondees and shall provide such additional
information as Purchasers may reasonably request for purposes of their
internal bookkeeping, accounting, operations and management. To the extent not
in conflict with the foregoing, Seller shall maintain its accounts and
employee records in accordance with past practice.

 



 

(b) Purchasers and Recipient shall be responsible for maintaining full and
accurate accounts and records in respect of the Secondees during the
Secondment and shall provide Seller and its Affiliates on a bi-weekly basis
(or such other basis as is appropriate) all information they may reasonably
request to calculate and pay or otherwise provide the Salaries of each
Secondee, which shall include but not be limited to all hours worked by the
Secondee, the locations where the Services were rendered, and a description of
any time off taken.

 



 

(c) At any time during the Term of this Agreement, and for a period of six (6)
months after termination or expiration of this Agreement, Purchasers, the
other Recipients, or an authorized independent auditor or counsel of
Purchasers or such Recipients, shall have the right to inspect Sellers books
and records relating to the Secondments upon reasonable (and no less than
fifteen (15) days) prior written notice during regular business hours and
without undue disruption of the normal operations of Seller. At any time
during the Term of this Agreement, and for a period of six (6) months after
termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Seller, its Affiliates, or an
authorized independent auditor or counsel of the Seller or

 



      
 

 



 

its Affiliates, shall have the right to inspect Purchasers and any other
Recipients books and records relating to the Secondees upon reasonable (and no
less than fifteen (15) days) prior written notice during regular business
hours and without undue disruption of the normal operations of Purchasers or
Recipients.

 



 

(d) All information to which Purchasers, the Recipients, Seller, its
Affiliates or their respective representatives gain access pursuant to this
_Section 8_ shall be subject to the terms of the confidentiality provisions
set forth in _Section 11_ of this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.** **_Independent Contractor Status_**.

 



 

This Agreement constitutes a contract for the provision of services only and
not a contract of employment. The Secondees shall at all times whilst they are
Secondees under the terms of this Agreement be employees of the Seller or the
relevant Subsidiary of Seller. Nothing in this Agreement shall render or be
deemed to render the Secondees as employees of the Recipient. Nothing in this
Agreement shall constitute or be construed as constituting or establishing any
partnership or joint venture between the Parties for any purpose whatsoever.
None of the Parties shall be entitled to enter into agreements or other
arrangements on behalf of any of the other parties. The terms of this
Agreement are not intended to cause any of the Parties and their Affiliates to
become a joint employer for any purpose.

 



 

 **10.** **_Intellectual Property_**.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, all Intellectual Property Rights
which arise by virtue of the activities of the Secondees in the performance
and supply of the Services (the " _Relevant IPRs_ ") shall belong to the
Recipient exclusively and absolutely and are hereby assigned by Seller or the
relevant Subsidiary to the Recipient together with all rights of action
accrued thereto. Seller shall direct the Secondees to assign the Relevant IPRs
to the Recipient together with all rights of actions accrued thereto.

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Relevant IPRs are not capable of being assigned by
operation of _Section 10(a)_ or fail to vest in the Recipient for any other
reason, Seller shall direct that the applicable Secondee shall undertake to
irrevocably appoint the applicable Recipient as the Secondees exclusive agent
for administering such Relevant IPR and to irrevocably assign to the
applicable Recipient any and all right, title and interest in and to all
royalties and other payments to be paid to the Secondee pursuant to such
Relevant IPRs.

 



 

(c) Seller shall, and Seller shall direct that the Secondees shall, at the
request and expense of the relevant Recipient, forthwith execute such
documents and do such things as may be required to effectively assign to and
vest in the Recipient all Relevant IPRs and enable the Recipient to register
or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise obtain for its own benefit and in its own name any Relevant IPRs and
to maintain, defend and enforce the interest of the Recipient in the Relevant
IPRs. All reasonable costs associated with such activities will be paid by the
Recipient.

 



 

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Seller hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and Seller shall direct that the Secondees irrevocably
waive, any and all moral rights (whether conferred by the Copyright Designs
and Patents Act 1988 or otherwise) which may arise directly out of, or in
connection with, the performance by the Secondees and/or Seller of the
Services.

 



 

(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Intellectual Property Rights_ "
means all (i) patents, patent disclosures and inventions (whether patentable
or not), (ii) trademarks, service marks, trade dress, trade names, logos,
corporate names and domain names, together with all of the goodwill associated
therewith, (iii) copyrights and copyrightable works (including computer
programs), and rights in data and databases, (iv) trade secrets, know-how and
other confidential information, (v) all license rights, whether as licensor or
as licensee, under any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, know how,
and other proprietary information, and (vi) all other intellectual property
rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all
applications for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights, and all similar
or equivalent rights or forms of protection in any part of the world.

 



 

 **11.** **_Confidential Information_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise required under Applicable Law, each Party hereto
agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain as
confidential any and all information provided by or on behalf of either Party
to the other, or otherwise obtained by such Party or its Affiliates after the
date hereof in connection with or as a result of this Agreement. The Parties
further agree to cooperate with each other, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, to develop and implement security and file guarding procedures
that are designed to maintain the integrity of the Parties confidential
information and proprietary systems and software. Nothing contained in this
Section shall limit or affect in any way obligations of the Parties or their
respective Affiliates to maintain the confidentiality of information pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 11(a)_, each Party and its
Affiliates may disclose confidential information to each other and to their
own personnel to the extent required for the proper performance of this
Agreement, conditional upon any such personnel being informed of the
confidential nature of the information and the relevant Party using its

 



      
 

 



 

commercially reasonably efforts to cause such personnel to comply with the
provision of _Section 11(a)_ as if it were a party to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If a Party becomes legally compelled to disclose any confidential
information disclosed by the other Party, the receiving Party shall provide
(i) prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing Party may
seek, at its sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy, and
(ii) reasonable assistance, at the disclosing Partys sole cost and expense,
in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations
on disclosure. If, after providing such notice and assistance as required
herein, the receiving Party remains required by Applicable Law to disclose any
confidential information of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall
disclose no more than that portion of the confidential information which the
receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, upon the disclosing
Partys request, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances from the applicable court or agency that such confidential
information will be afforded confidential treatment.

 



 

(d) If either Party becomes aware of any breach of confidence or unauthorized
use of confidential information by any of its personnel, it shall promptly
notify the other Party.

 



 

(e) Immediately following the expiration or termination of this Agreement,
each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, if requested in writing
to do so by the other Party either (i) provide to the disclosing Party all of
the disclosing Partys confidential information and other data and materials
which is then such Partys (or its Affiliates) control or possession; or (ii)
at the written request of the disclosing Party, destroy or delete such
confidential information and shall confirm to the disclosing Party in writing
that it has done so.

 



 

 **12.** **_Protection of Business Interests_**.

 



 

Where the contract of employment between a Secondee and Seller or relevant
Seller Subsidiary contains any provision intended to protect the interests of
the Business, including without limitation any provision intended to restrict
such Secondee from competing with the Business or any business carried out by
a Recipient, Seller shall, subject to Applicable Law, direct (or shall procure
that the relevant Seller Subsidiary directs) such Secondee to comply with such
provision.

 



 

 **13.** **_Limitation of Liability, Indemnity; Disclaimer of Warranty_**.

 



 

(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, SELLER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH
OF ITS AFFILIATES, HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY
REPRESENTATION OR

 



      
 

 



 

WARRANTY IN REGARD TO QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, NONINFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL
UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE SERVICES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability in contract, tort (including negligence)
or otherwise, for or in connection with the Secondment of the Secondees
pursuant to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the actions or inactions of Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with
the Secondment of the Secondees, to any Purchaser Indemnified Party, except to
the extent that a Purchaser Indemnified Party suffers, sustains or becomes
subject to any losses, claims, liabilities, damages or expenses (" _Losses_ ")
that result from Sellers or any of its Affiliates breach of this Agreement,
or gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the Secondment of
the Secondees, transactions, actions or inactions.

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall defend, indemnify,
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against all
Losses, which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may actually suffer, sustain or
become subject to resulting from, arising out of, based upon the Secondment of
the Secondees, or otherwise in respect of, any material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking made by Seller pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, that, (x) claims for indemnification made pursuant
to this _Section 13(c)_ shall be limited to, in the aggregate, the total
amount of Service Fees paid or payable to Seller hereunder; save that no such
cap shall apply in connection with (i) sums for which the Seller is liable
pursuant to _Section 4_, (ii) any Losses sustained by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party under the indemnity in _Section 4(c)_, or (iii) as a result
of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or any of its
Affiliates; and (y) in no event will Seller (or any of its Affiliates) be
liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any special, indirect or
consequential Losses, whether arising in contract, tort (including a Partys
negligence) or otherwise.

 



 

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, Purchasers shall defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
all Losses which any Seller Indemnified Party may suffer or sustain or become
subject to resulting from, arising out of, based upon or otherwise in respect
of any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
undertaking made by Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement and any claims by
third parties arising out of the acts or omissions of any and all Secondees
with respect to the Services; provided that, (x) claims for indemnification
made pursuant to this _Section 13(d)_ shall be limited to, in the aggregate,
the total amount of Service Fees paid or payable to Seller hereunder; save
that no such cap shall apply in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with (i) sums for which any Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
liable pursuant to _Section 4_, (ii) any Losses sustained by any Seller
Indemnified Party under the indemnity in _Section 4(c)_, or (iii) as a result
of the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates; and (y) in no event will Purchasers (or any of their
Affiliates) be liable to any Seller Indemnified Party for any special,
indirect or consequential Losses, whether arising in contract, tort (including
a Partys negligence) or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of
any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



 

(f) In the event Seller (or any Seller Indemnified Party) or Purchasers (or
any Purchaser Indemnified Party), as applicable (an " _Indemnitee_ "), shall
have a claim for indemnity against the other Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ")
under the terms of this Agreement arising out of a third party claim, the
Parties shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 8.6 of the Purchase
Agreement as if fully set forth herein.

 



 

(g) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this Agreement
shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit (as defined in Section 8.7 of
the Purchase Agreement) received by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates on
account of such Loss and (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of direct collection
expenses) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by
the Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto. If the Indemnitee
receives a Tax Benefit on account of any Loss after an indemnification payment
is made to it with respect to such Loss, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to
the Indemnitor the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to
the extent that such Tax Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnitee. The
Indemnitee shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any
Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is
made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has
been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery less any costs of recovery or any taxes incurred on the amount
recovered shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor. The Indemnitors shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees and their Affiliates in respect of
any Losses indemnified by the Indemnitors.

 



 

(h) Without prejudice to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and except as
expressly provided in _Section 13(i)_, the indemnifications provided by
_Section 4_, _Section 13(c),_ and _Section 13(d)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any Loss incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or
the Seller Indemnified Parties (as the case may be) with respect to any

 



      
 

 



 

misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representations or
warranties or any breach or failure in performance of any covenants or
agreements made by Seller or Purchasers in this Agreement or in any exhibit or
schedules hereto.

 



 

(i) Each Party recognizes and expressly acknowledges and agrees that any
failure by it or its Affiliates (including, in the case of Seller, the
Secondees) to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or
other breach of this Agreement by such Party may cause irreparable injury to
the other Party for which an adequate monetary remedy may not exist.
Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party may seek and obtain
temporary injunctive and other temporary equitable relief (including an order
of specific performance), in each case without necessity of posting a bond,
restraining such breach or threatened breach or compelling the cure thereof,
and that such relief may be sought, among other options, in the form of a
temporary restraining order obtained in an ex parte proceeding. The rights
provided under this _Section 13(i)_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other rights and remedies available to Purchasers.

 



 

(j) No claim shall be brought or maintained by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties or their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any officer, director, employee (present or former)
or Affiliate of any Party which is not otherwise expressly identified as a
party hereto, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them,
by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of any Party set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto.

 



 

(k) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties may not avoid the limitations on
liability set forth in this _Section 13_ by seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability and the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties hereby waive such claims to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law.

 



 

 **14.** **_Dispute Resolution_.**

 



 

Prior to the initiation of any action, lawsuit, proceeding or other claim
relating to this Agreement and subject to the obligations set forth in
_Section 1(f)_, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
first be referred to the Service Managers, who shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any such dispute, controversy or claim. Any dispute, controversy or
claim that is not resolved by the Service Managers shall be referred to the
[Executive Officer] of Seller and the [Executive Officer] of Purchasers. In
the event that any Party, after complying with the provisions set forth in
this _Section 14_ desires to commence an action, lawsuit, proceeding or other
claim relating to this Agreement, such Party, subject

 



       
 

 



 

to _Section 15(o)_, may submit the dispute, controversy or claim (or such
series of related disputes, controversies or claims) to any court of competent
jurisdiction.

 



 

 **15.** **_Miscellaneous_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Authorization_. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other
Party that: (i) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and perform its obligations hereunder; (ii) the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by such Party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
requisite action, and no other proceedings on its part are necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement; (iii) this
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Party and assuming that
this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the other Party, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of such Party,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights in general and
subject to general principles of equity and the discretion of courts in
granting equitable remedies; and (iv) delivery and performance of this
Agreement by such Party does not contravene or conflict with any provision of
Applicable Law or of its charter or bylaws (or equivalent documents) or any
material agreement, instrument or order binding on such Party.

 



 

(b) _Compliance_. Each Party shall be responsible for its own compliance with
any and all Applicable Laws applicable to its performance under this
Agreement. No Party will take any action in violation of any such Applicable
Law that would reasonably be likely to result in liability being imposed on
the other Party. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchasers acknowledge and
agree that Seller shall not, and may refuse to, make any Secondment to the
extent that the making such Secondment would require Seller, or any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates, to violate any
Applicable Laws or any Seller policies and/or procedures (it being confirmed
by Seller that, as at the date of this Agreement, it is not aware of any such
Applicable Laws or policies and procedures that will be violated by the making
of the Secondment). Purchasers shall, and shall cause each of the other
Recipients, to follow the policies and procedures of Seller and its Affiliates
that are known to Purchasers or any other Recipient with respect to the
services provided to it by Seller or its Affiliates, including those in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date and any changes thereto that are known
to Purchasers or any Recipient. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchasers
shall, and shall cause each of the other Recipients to, comply with all
policies, procedures and regulations of Seller or its Affiliates relating to
continuity of business, computer and network security measures and data
encryption that are known to Purchasers or any other Recipient, including any
security

 



      
 

 



 

requirements reasonably requested by Seller or its Affiliates. Each Party
shall be responsible for its Affiliates, and its and their subcontractors,
consultants and agents compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Parties in Interest. Other than Persons entitled to receive
indemnification under _Section 4(c)_, _Section 13(c)_ and _Section 13(d)_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer on any
Person other than the Parties, the other Recipients, and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies under or by virtue of
this Agreement. Each Purchaser Indemnified Party other than Purchasers, and
each Seller Indemnified Party other than Seller, is an express, third party
beneficiary of _Section 4(c)_, _Section 13(c)_ and _Section 13(d)_.

 



 

(d) _Schedules_. The Schedules attached hereto are incorporated herein by
reference and shall be construed with and as an integral part of this
Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim
herein.

 



 

(e) _Entire Agreement_. The terms of this Agreement (including the Employee
Schedule) and other documents and instruments referenced herein (including the
Purchase Agreement) are intended by the Parties as a final expression of their
agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and may not be
contradicted by evidence of any prior or contemporaneous agreement. The
Parties further intend that this Agreement constitutes the complete and
exclusive statement of its terms and that no extrinsic evidence whatsoever may
be introduced in any judicial proceeding, if any, involving this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the Employee
Schedule may be amended or waived only in a writing signed by all of the
Parties. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof
shall extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach or default.

 



 

(g) _Notices_. All notices, demands and other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (i) when personally delivered,
(ii) when transmitted via email to the email address set out below if the
sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a recognized
overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (iii) the day following the day
(except if not a Business Day then the next Business Day) on which the same
has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight air courier
service or (iv) the third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the
same is sent by certified or registered U.S. mail, postage prepaid. Notices,
demands and communications, in each case to the respective Parties, shall be
sent to the

(h) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
any Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, and any
attempt to assign any rights or obligations arising under this Agreement
without such consent shall be null and void; provided that: (i) Purchasers may
assign any of their rights and interests (but not their respective
obligations) hereunder (A) to any other Recipient, or (B) by way of security
to any of its lending banks in connection with the Purchase; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Seller may assign any of its rights and interests (but not its
obligations) hereunder to any other member of the Seller Group.

 



 

(i) _Successors and Assigns_. Subject to _Section 15(h)_, this Agreement and
all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by (and against) the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted transferees and assigns.

 



 

(j) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under Applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(k) _References_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and will not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and construed
as if no captions had been used in this Agreement. Unless the context
otherwise requires, any reference to a "Section" or "Schedule" shall be deemed
to refer to a section of this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as
applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. English shall be the governing
language of this Agreement. The word "including" shall mean "including,
without limitation."

 



 

(l) _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Consequently, in
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(m) _Force Majeure_. No Party shall be in default of its obligations hereunder
for any delays or failure in performance to the extent resulting from any
cause or circumstance beyond such Partys reasonable control as long as the
Party exercises commercially reasonable efforts to perform its obligations in
a timely manner.

 



 

(n) _Delivery by PDF_. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered into in
connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of an

 



      
 

 



 

electronically transmitted portable document format, shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of either Party, the other Party
shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting
Party. No Party shall raise the use of electronic transmission in portable
document format to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of electronic
transmission in portable document format as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

 



 

(o) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one Party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 



 

(p) _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. Each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and hereby
expressly submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such court for the
purposes thereof and expressly waives any claim of improper venue and any
claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum. Each Party hereby
irrevocably consents to the service of process of any of the aforementioned
court in any such suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the address set forth or
referred to in _Section 15(g)_.

 



 

(q) _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, REGARDLESS OF
WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

, , by and among Liberty Mergeco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" **US Purchaser** ") and Liberty Bidco UK Limited, a corporation incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales (the " **UK Purchaser** " and, together
with the US Purchaser, the " **Purchaser** "), Hill International, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" **Hill Delaware** "), and Hill International N.V., a
corporation organized under the laws of the Netherlands (" **Hill N.V.** "
and, together with Hill Delaware, the " **Seller** "), and Citibank, N.A., a
national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the
United States of America (" **Citibank** ") solely in its capacity as escrow
agent under this Agreement, and any successors appointed pursuant to the terms
hereof (Citibank in such capacity, the " **Escrow Agent** "). Purchaser and
Seller are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the " **Interested
Parties** " and each individually as an " **Interested Party** ".

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
, 2016 (the " **Purchase Agreement** "), by and among the Interested Parties
(among other parties), the Interested Parties have agreed to establish an
escrow arrangement for the purposes set forth therein. Capitalized terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Purchase Agreement.

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** the Interested Parties wish to appoint Citibank as Escrow Agent
and Citibank is willing to accept such appointment and to act as Escrow Agent,
in each case upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which is hereby irrevocably acknowledged, the parties hereto agree
as follows, with the intent to be legally bound **:**

 



 

 **1.** **_Establishment of Escrow Account_. **On the date hereof, Hill
Delaware shall deposit with the Escrow Agent (a) a stand-by letter of credit
having a stated amount equal to $3,750,000(1) (the " **Indemnity Escrow
Property** " and such letter of credit the " **Indemnity Letter of Credit** ")
and (b) immediately available funds in the amount of $5,000,000 (the "
**Completion Accounts Escrow Property** " and, together with the Indemnity
Escrow Property, the " **Escrow Property** "), and the Escrow Agent shall hold
the Escrow Property, including holding all cash portions thereof in a non-
interest bearing deposit account established with the Escrow Agent (the "
**Escrow Property Account** "). Any compensation or investment income or
proceeds received thereon, if any, from time to time will become part of the
Indemnity Escrow Property.

 



 

 **2.** **_Claims and Payment; Release from Escrow_.**

 



 

(a) **_Disbursement upon Joint Written Instructions_**. Except as otherwise
contemplated by _Section 2(b) and (c)_, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the
Escrow Property (including any amounts drawn on the Indemnity Letter of
Credit), or any portion thereof, only in accordance with the joint written
instructions signed by an authorized person of each of the Seller and the
Purchaser (the person(s) so designated from time to time, the " **Authorized
Persons** ") (such signed joint written instructions, " **Joint Instructions**
"). Such Joint Instructions

  (1) Note to draft: This agreement remains subject to adjustment prior to
closing to reflect letter of credit mechanics.

      
 

 



 

shall set forth sufficient payment instructions for each portion of the Escrow
Property to be distributed and the Escrow Agent shall act solely upon the
Joint Instructions. The Interested Parties, as between themselves, agree that
any such Joint Instructions that disburse any Escrow Property to the Seller
shall apportion such disbursement between Hill Delaware and Hill N.V. as
required by the Purchase Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, when the Net
Working Capital is finally determined in accordance with the Purchase
Agreement, the Interested Parties agree, as between themselves, to deliver a
Joint Instruction providing for the release of the Completion Accounts Escrow
Property in accordance with Sections 1.5 and 1.6 of the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Disbursement Pursuant to Claims_.

 



 

(1) From time to time at or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on
, (2) (such anniversary, the " **Escrow Termination Date** "), an
Authorized Person of the Purchaser (on behalf of itself or another Purchaser
Indemnified Party) may deliver to the Escrow Agent and the Seller any number
of written notices of claims for indemnification (each, an " **Escrow Claim
Notice** ") in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, which (subject to the
provisions of the Purchase Agreement) shall (A) describe in reasonable detail
the claim and the basis of the Purchaser Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification, and contain a good faith estimate of the amount of the Losses
attributable to such claim (the " **Claim Amount** ") and that the Purchaser
Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification or other payment from the
Indemnity Escrow Property pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement (an
" **Indemnification Obligation** "), and (B) specify detailed payment
instructions for such Purchaser Indemnified Party (if applicable). Any Escrow
Claim Notice delivered pursuant to this _Section 2(b)(1)_ with respect to any
unliquidated Indemnification Obligation may be supplemented, prior to such
time as any amount with respect to such Escrow Claim Notice is distributed
hereto, by a later Escrow Claim Notice specifying the applicable Claim Amount
or any other items set forth therein. The Escrow Agent shall promptly forward
to the Seller a copy of any Escrow Claim Notice received from the Purchaser.

 



 

(2) If the Seller objects to the Indemnification Obligation or any portion of
the Claim Amount specified in such Escrow Claim Notice, the Seller shall,
within 30 calendar days after delivery by the Escrow Agent of a copy of such
Escrow Claim Notice received from the Purchaser to the Seller (the " **Reply
Period** "), deliver to the Escrow Agent, a certificate (a " **Claim Reply
Certificate** "), with a copy of such Claim Reply Certificate to the
Purchaser, (A) noting, in reasonable detail, its objection to the
Indemnification Obligation or Claim Amount and (B) specifying in reasonable
detail, to the extent possible, the basis for such objection. The Escrow Agent
shall promptly forward to the Purchaser a courtesy copy of any Claim Reply
Certificate received from the Seller. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
promptly negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach written resolution of any
objections raised in a Claim Reply Certificate.

 



 

(3) If a Claim Reply Certificate is not received by the Escrow Agent from the
Seller prior to the expiration of the Reply Period with respect to any Escrow
Claim Notice, then the Seller shall be deemed to have agreed to the
Purchasers right to

  (2) Insert one year anniversary of closing.

 



      
 

 



 

receive the Claim Amount specified in such Escrow Claim Notice with respect to
the applicable Indemnification Obligation (a " **Payment Authorization** ").
If a Claim Reply Certificate pursuant to which the Seller objects to only a
portion of the Claim Amount specified in the applicable Escrow Claim Notice is
received by the Escrow Agent from the Seller prior to the expiration of the
Reply Period, then the Seller shall be deemed to have delivered a Payment
Authorization acknowledging the Purchasers right to receive the uncontested
portion of such Claim Amount.

 



 

(4) If the Escrow Agent receives a Claim Reply Certificate pursuant to
_Section 2(b)(2)_ the portion of the Claim Amount contested in such Claim
Reply Certificate shall not be released to the Purchaser, except upon receipt
by the Escrow Agent of either (A) Joint Instructions directing the Escrow
Agent to release the Claim Amount (or any other amount mutually agreed upon by
such parties) to the Purchaser or (B) a final non-appealable order of a court
of competent jurisdiction, a copy of which is delivered to the Escrow Agent by
either the Seller or the Purchaser and concurrently to the other party hereto,
that instructs the Escrow Agent as to the disbursement of all or any portion
of the Escrow Property along with opinion of counsel of the prevailing
Interested Party to the effect that such order is final and non-appealable and
written payment instructions of the prevailing Interested Party to effectuate
such order (a " **Final Award** "), relating to the Indemnification
Obligations referred to in such Claim Reply Certificate demonstrating that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification for such Claim
Amount pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (or any other amount set forth in
such Final Award) (either _(A)_ or _(B)_ being deemed a Payment
Authorization hereunder). The Escrow Agent may request (at the expense of the
presenting party) and conclusively rely upon an opinion of counsel to the
effect that any order of a court is final, non-appealable, and from a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

(5) As soon as practicable following a Payment Authorization (but in no event
later than three Business Days thereafter), the Escrow Agent shall draw on the
Indemnity Letter of Credit the amount authorized by such Payment Authorization
and disburse such amount to the Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Purchasers account set forth in _Section 12(b)_ or to
such other account or a Purchaser Indemnified Party identified by the
Purchaser in the Escrow Claim Notice.

 



 

(c) _Other Disbursement_.(3) Within three Business Days following the Escrow
Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to the Seller pursuant to
its wire transfer instructions set forth in _Section 12(b)_ the Indemnity
Escrow Property remaining in the Escrow Property Account at such time after
deduction of the aggregate Claim Amounts paid; provided, however that if any
claims under any Escrow Claim Notice are then pending, the aggregate Claim
Amounts for such claims, or such other amounts as the Purchaser and the Seller
may agree in writing and communicate to the Escrow Agent no later than the
Escrow Termination Date, shall not be disbursed on such date but shall be
retained by the Escrow Agent until the Escrow Agent receives Joint
Instructions or notice of a Final Award as contemplated in _Section 2(b)(4)_.

  (3) Note to draft: Mechanics regarding Indemnity Letter of Credit release to
be implemented following review of letter of credit and in consultation with
the Escrow Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Escrow Agent shall act solely upon the instructions, notices, claims
and objections it receives from the Interested Parties under this Section 2
and shall not be responsible for determining whether such instructions are in
accordance with the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

 **3.** **_Investment of Funds_.**

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Interested Parties, the cash
portions of the Escrow Property shall be held in a "noninterest-bearing
deposit account" insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("
**FDIC** ") to the applicable limits. Thereafter, any other investment and any
instruction to change investments must be in writing executed by the
Interested Parties, which shall specify the type and identity of the
investments to be purchased and/or sold (the " ** _Permitted Investments_**
"), _provided_ that such instructions are received by the Escrow Agent at
least two Business Days prior to the proposed date of such investment, and
such investment is available to the Escrow Agent. Any Escrow Property or
written notice to remit payment received by the Escrow Agent after 11:00 a.m.
New York City time shall be treated as if received on the following Business
Day. For purposes of this Agreement, " **Business Day** " shall mean any day
that the Escrow Agent is open for business.

 



 

(b) Any investment direction contained herein may be executed through an
affiliated broker dealer of the Escrow Agent and will be entitled to such
usual and customary fee. Neither the Escrow Agent nor any of its affiliates
assume any duty or liability for monitoring the investment rating.

 



 

 **4.** **_Tax Matters_.**

 



 

(a) The Interested Parties agree that, unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, any earnings from the Escrow Property during a calendar year period
shall be (i) treated as the income of the Purchaser, with [ ]% being
allocated to the US Purchaser and [ ]% being allocated to the UK
Purchaser,(4) and (ii) shall be reported on an annual basis by the Escrow
Agent on the appropriate United States Internal Revenue Service (" **IRS** ")
Form 1099 INT (or IRS Form 1042-S), as required pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (" **Code** ") and the regulations
thereunder.

 



 

(b) If IRS imputed interest requirements apply, the Interested Parties shall
provide the Escrow Agent prior to any disbursement, a detailed schedule
indicating he allocation of such disbursement from the Escrow Property between
(i) principal, (ii) imputed interest to be reported on IRS Form 1099 INT or
1042S or (iii) Original Issue Discount (" **OID** ") to be reported on Form
1099 OID, along with the relevant payee tax information, documentation, and
proportionate interest thereof. The Escrow Agent shall rely solely on such
information and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness
of any such calculations or information or for the failure of the Interested
Parties to provide such information.

 



 

(c) The Interested Parties shall upon the execution of this Agreement provide
the Escrow Agent with a duly completed and properly executed IRS Form W-9 (or
original

  (4) Note to draft: to be allocated in accordance with their respective
portions of the total purchase price.

 



      
 

 



 

applicable IRS Form W-8, in the case of a non-U.S. person) along with any
supporting documentation certifying such Interested Partys tax status for
U.S. tax information reporting purposes and tax identification number. In the
event the payee is not an Interested Party or a party to this Agreement, the
Interested Parties shall provide the Escrow Agent with the applicable duly
completed and properly executed IRS Form along with any required supporting
documentation from such payee prior to payment being made. The Interested
Parties understand that, in the event valid U.S. tax forms or other required
supporting documentation are not provided to the Escrow Agent, the tax law may
require withholding of tax on any earnings, proceeds or distributions from the
Escrow Property and further, such withholdings will be taken from the Escrow
Property and deposited with the IRS in the manner prescribed for the Escrow
Agent to perform its reporting obligations under the Code, the Foreign Account
Tax Compliance Act and any other applicable law or regulation. Any amounts
withheld pursuant to the preceding sentence will be treated as distributions
to the person(s) from whom such amounts were withheld.

 



 

(d) Should the Escrow Agent become liable for the payment of taxes, including
withholding taxes relating to any funds, including interest and penalties
thereon, held by it pursuant to this Agreement or any payment made hereunder,
the Interested Parties agree, jointly and severally, to reimburse the Escrow
Agent for such taxes, interest and penalties upon demand. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct such taxes, interest
and penalties from the Escrow Property.

 



 

(e) The Interested Parties and the Escrow Agent agree that the Escrow Agent
will not be responsible for providing tax reporting and withholding for
payments which are for compensation for services performed by an employee or
independent contractor.

 



 

(f) The Escrow Agents rights under this Section shall survive the termination
of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. The
Interested Parties hereby represent to the Escrow Agent no other tax reporting
of any kind is required in connection with this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.** **_Concerning the Escrow Agent_.**

 



 

(a) _Escrow Agent Duties_. Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be
limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement, each of which is
administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed to be fiduciary) in
nature, and no duties, responsibilities or obligations shall be inferred or
implied, (ii) the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any of the
agreements referred to or described herein (including without limitation the
Purchase Agreement), or for determining or compelling compliance therewith,
and shall not otherwise be bound thereby, and (iii) the Escrow Agent shall not
be required to expend or risk any of its own funds to satisfy payments from
the Escrow Property hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Liability of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any
damage, loss or injury resulting from any action taken or omitted in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction).

 



      
 

 



 

The Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for the investment or
reinvestment of any Escrow Property, or any liquidation of such investment or
reinvestment, executed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any liability for any delays in the investment
or reinvestment of the Escrow Property, any loss of interest incident to any
such delays, or any loss or penalty as a result of the liquidation of any
investment before its stated maturity date. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon any instruction, notice, request or other instrument delivered to
it without being required to determine the authenticity or validity thereof,
or the truth or accuracy of any information stated therein. The Escrow Agent
may act in reliance upon any signature believed by it to be genuine and may
assume that any person purporting to make any statement or execute any
document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to
do so. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel satisfactory to it, and the
opinion or advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good
faith and in accordance with the opinion and advice of such counsel. The
Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not performing any act or

services or any electronic communication facility).

 



 

(c) _Reliance on Orders_. The Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with final
orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the Escrow
Property, without determination by the Escrow Agent of such courts
jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of the Escrow Property is at any
time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property
shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment
or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any
part thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is authorized to
rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is
advised is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if
the Escrow Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it
shall not be liable to any of the Interested Parties hereto or to any other
person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ,
judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside
or vacated.

 



 

(d) _Unlawful Gambling_. In accordance with the Unlawful Internet Gambling Act
(the " **Act** "), the Interested Parties may not use the Escrow Account or
other Citibank facilities in the United States to process restricted
transactions as such term is defined in 31 CFR Section 132.2(y). Therefore,
neither the Interested Parties nor any person who has an ownership interest in
or control over the Escrow Account may use it to process or facilitate
payments for prohibited internet gambling transactions. For more information
about the Act, including the types of transactions that are prohibited, please

(e) _Secure E-mail_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any and
all e-mail communications (both text and attachments) by or from the Escrow
Agent that the Escrow Agent deems to contain confidential, proprietary, and/or
sensitive information shall be

 



      
 

 



 

encrypted. The recipient (the " **E-mail Recipient** ") of the encrypted
e-mail communication will be required to complete a registration process.
Instructions on how to register and/or retrieve an encrypted message will be
included in the first secure e-mail sent by the Escrow Agent to the E-mail
Recipient. Additional information and assistance on using the encryption
technology can be found at Citibanks Secure E-mail website at

(f) _Tax Advice_. The Escrow Agent, its affiliates, and its employees are not
in the business of providing tax or legal advice to any taxpayer outside of
the Escrow Agent and its affiliates. This Agreement and any amendments or
attachments are not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used or
relied upon, by any such taxpayer or for the purpose of avoiding tax
penalties. Any such taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayers
particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

 



 

 **6.** **_Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and Indemnification_.**

 



 

(a) _Compensation._ Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees,
jointly and severally, to pay the Escrow Agents fees and expenses specified
in _Schedule A_. Any attorneys fees incurred in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and any Escrow Agent acceptance
fees shall be due and payable upon the execution of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agent will provide a statement of any such fees to the Interested Parties
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement. As between themselves, each
of the Seller and the Purchaser covenants and agrees to pay 50% of the Escrow
Agents fees and expenses specified in _Schedule A_.

 



 

(b) _Security and Offset_. The Interested Parties hereby grant to the Escrow
Agent a first lien upon, and right of offset against, the Escrow Property with
respect to any fees or expenses due to the Escrow Agent hereunder (including
any claim for indemnification hereunder). In the event that any fees or
expenses, or any other obligations owed to the Escrow Agent (or its counsel)
are not paid to the Escrow Agent within 30 calendar days following the
presentment of an invoice for the payment of such fees and expenses or the
demand for such payment, then the Escrow Agent may, without further action or
notice, pay such fees from the Escrow Property and may sell, convey or
otherwise dispose of any Escrow Property for such purpose. The Escrow Agent
may in its sole discretion withhold from any distribution of the Escrow
Property an amount of such distribution it reasonably believes would, upon
sale or liquidation, produce proceeds equal to any unpaid amounts to which the
Escrow Agent is entitled to hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Indemnification._ Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees,
jointly and severally, to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its employees,
officers, directors, affiliates, and agents (each, an " **Escrow Agent
Indemnified Party** ") for, hold each Escrow Agent Indemnified Party harmless
from, and defend each Escrow Agent Indemnified Party against, any and all
claims, losses, actions, liabilities, costs, damages and expenses of any
nature incurred by any Escrow Agent Indemnified Party, arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or with (a) the administration of its duties
hereunder, including but not limited to attorneys fees, costs and expenses,
tax liabilities (including any taxes, interest and penalties but

 



      
 

 



 

excluding any income tax liabilities associated with the Escrow Agents fees),
and other costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any
claim of liability (whether threatened or initiated), except to the extent
such loss, liability, damage, cost or expense shall have been finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from
the Escrow Agent Indemnified Partys own gross negligence or willful
misconduct; or (b) its following any instructions or other directions from the
Purchaser or Seller, except to the extent that its following any such
instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. Each
Escrow Agent Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and employ
separate counsel with respect to any action or claim brought or asserted
against it, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid upon
demand by the Interested Parties jointly and severally. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent
be liable, directly or indirectly for special, indirect, incidental, punitive
or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The
foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold harmless shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow
Agent. As between themselves, each of the Seller and the Purchaser covenants
and agrees to pay 50% of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6_.

 



 

 **7.** **_Dispute Resolution_. **In the event of any disagreement among any
of the Interested Parties to this Agreement, or between any of them and any
other person, resulting in adverse claims or demands being made with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement, or in the event that the Escrow
Agent, in good faith, is in doubt as to any action it should take hereunder,
the Escrow Agent may, at its option, refuse to comply with any claims or
demands and refuse to take any other action hereunder, so long as such
disagreement continues or such doubt exists, and in any such event, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable in any way or to any person for its failure or
refusal to act, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue to so
refuse to act and refrain from acting until (i) the rights of all parties
having or claiming an interest in the Escrow Property or the Escrow Account
shall have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or all differences and doubts shall have been resolved by
agreement among all of the Interested Parties, and (ii) the Escrow Agent
shall, in the case of adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction, have
received a final order, judgment or decree by such court of competent
jurisdiction, which order, judgment or decree is not subject to appeal, and in
the case of resolution of differences and doubts by agreement, have received a
notice in writing signed by an Authorized Person (as defined below) of each of
the Interested Parties setting forth in detail the agreement. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to receive (from and at the expense of the presenting party)
an opinion of counsel to the effect that any order, judgment or decree is
final and not subject to appeal. The Escrow Agent shall have the option, after
30 calendar days notice to the Interested Parties of its intention to do so,
to petition (by means of filing an action in interpleader or any other
appropriate method) any court of competent jurisdiction, for instructions with
respect to any dispute or uncertainty, and to the extent required or permitted
by law, pay into such court the Escrow Property for holding and disposition in
accordance with the instructions of such court. The costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the Escrow
Agent in connection with such proceeding shall be paid by, and be the joint
and several obligation of, the Interested Parties. The rights of

 



      
 

 



 

the Escrow Agent under this Section 7 are cumulative of all other rights which
it may have by law or otherwise.

 



 

 **8.** **_Exclusive Benefit_. **Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, this Agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and their respective permitted successors, and shall not be deemed
to give, either expressly or implicitly, any legal or equitable right, remedy,
or claim to any other entity or person whatsoever. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 19 below, no party may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties.

 



 

 **9.** **_Resignation and Removal_.**

 



 

(a) The Interested Parties may remove the Escrow Agent at any time by giving
to the Escrow Agent thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice of removal
signed by an Authorized Person of each of the Interested Parties. The Escrow
Agent may resign at any time by giving to each of the Interested Parties
thirty (30) calendar days prior written notice of resignation.

 



 

(b) Within thirty (30) calendar days after giving the foregoing notice of
removal to the Escrow Agent or within thirty (30) calendar days after
receiving the foregoing notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, the
Interested Parties shall appoint a successor escrow agent and give notice of
such successor escrow agent to the Escrow Agent. If a successor escrow agent
has not accepted such appointment by the end of such (i) 30-day period, in the
case of the Escrow Agents removal, or (ii) 30-day period, in the case of the
Escrow Agents resignation, the Escrow Agent may either (A) safe keep the
Escrow Property until a successor escrow agent is appointed, without any
obligation to invest the same or continue to perform under this Agreement, or
(B) apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief.

 



 

(c) Upon receipt of notice of the identity of the successor escrow agent, the
Escrow Agent shall either deliver the Escrow Property then held hereunder to
the successor escrow agent, less the Escrow Agents fees, costs and expenses,
or hold such Escrow Property (or any portion thereof) pending distribution,
until all such fees, costs and expenses are paid to it.

 



 

(d) Upon delivery of the Escrow Property to the successor escrow agent, the
Escrow Agent shall have no further duties, responsibilities or obligations
hereunder.

 



 

 **10.** **_Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waivers_.**

 



 

(a) The parties agree that, to the extent such laws would otherwise not apply,
this Agreement (including this choice-of-law provision) and the rights and
obligations of the parties to this Agreement shall be governed by, construed
in accordance with, and all controversies and disputes arising under, in
connection with or in relation to this Agreement shall be resolved pursuant to
the laws of State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
for any proceedings commenced regarding this Agreement, including, but not
limited to, any interpleader proceeding or proceeding for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent the Escrow Agent may commence pursuant to this
Agreement. The parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts
for the determination of all issues in such proceedings and irrevocably waive
any objection to venue or inconvenient forum for any proceeding brought in any
such court.

 



 

(c) To the extent that in any jurisdiction any Interested Party may be
entitled to claim, for itself or its assets, immunity from suit, execution,
attachment (whether before or after judgment) or other legal process, each
such party hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim, and hereby waives, such
immunity.

 



 

(d) The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any right to trial by
jury with respect to any proceeding relating to this Agreement.

 



 

 **11.** **_Identifying Information_. **To help the U.S. government fight the
funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
identifies each person who opens an account. When an account is opened, the
Escrow Agent will ask for information that will allow the Escrow Agent to
identify relevant parties. The Interested Parties hereby acknowledge such
information disclosure requirements and agree to comply with all such
information disclosure requests from time to time from the Escrow Agent.

 



 

 **12.** **_Notices; Instructions_.**

 



 

(a) Any notice or instruction permitted or required hereunder shall be in
writing in English, and shall be sent (i) by personal delivery, (ii) by a
nationally recognized overnight courier or delivery service, (iii) by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, (iv)
by confirmed facsimile, or (v) by e-mail with a PDF attachment thereto of an
executed document, in each case addressed to the address and person(s)
designated below their respective signature hereto (or to such other address
as any such party may hereafter designate by written notice to the other
parties). Notices to the Escrow Agent shall only be effective upon actual
receipt by the Escrow Agent. Any notice or instruction must be executed by an
authorized person of an Interested Party (the person(s) so designated from
time to time, the " **Authorized Persons** "). The identity of such Authorized

shall remain in effect until the applicable Interested Party notifies the
Escrow Agent of any change thereto. The Escrow Agent is authorized to seek
confirmation of such notice or instruction by telephone call back to the

been resolved to its satisfaction. The persons and telephone numbers for call
backs may be changed only in writing, signed by an Authorized Person, actually

WHEREAS, the Closing is being consummated on the date of this Agreement (the "

covenant and agree as follows:

 



 

1. _Services; Standard and Manner of Performance; Third Party Resources_.

 



 

(a) _Seller Services_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, Seller shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers to:

 



 

(1) provide to Purchasers, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable (the " _Purchaser Recipients_ "), the services set forth in
_Exhibit 1_ hereto (as such _Exhibit_ may be amended or supplemented in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement) (the " _Seller Services
Schedule_ "); and

 



 

(2) to the extent not already completed as at Closing, undertake all of the
actions described or otherwise contemplated in the Steps Memo and the
operational separation plans set forth in _Exhibit 2_ hereto (as such
_Exhibit_ may be amended or supplemented in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement) (the " _Separation Plans_ "). The services and actions
described in _Exhibits 1 and 2_ shall, together with any actions described in
the Steps Memo which have not been completed as at the date hereof and which
are to be completed hereunder, comprise the " _Seller Services_." Subject to
_Section 1(c)(i)_, it is understood that the

obligated to perform or provide to any Purchaser Recipient, any services or
actions not expressly set forth in the Seller Services Schedule, the
Separation Plans or the Steps Memo.

 



 

(b) _Purchaser Services_. Subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, Purchasers shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or Third Party

_Exhibit 3_ shall comprise the " _Purchaser Services_." Subject to _Section
1(c)(ii)_, it is understood that the Purchaser Services do not include, and

provide to any Seller Recipient, any services or actions not expressly set
forth in the Purchaser Services Schedule. The Seller Services and Purchaser
Services are collectively referred to herein as the " _Services_."

 



 

(c) _Additional Services_.

 



 

(i) If, at any time during the three (3) month period beginning on the date of
this Agreement, Purchasers identify, and provide Seller with a reasonable
description of, any services or rights required by them which were provided by
or on behalf of a member of the Seller Group to or for the benefit of the
Business in the ordinary course of business within six (6) months prior to the
date of this Agreement, but which are not expressly set forth in the Seller
Services Schedule, the Separation Plans or the Steps Memo (the " _Additional
Seller Services_ "), Purchasers may request the Seller to provide such
Additional Seller Services, in which case the provisions of _Section
3(c)(iii)_ shall apply.

 



 

(ii) If, at any time during the three (3) month period beginning on the date
of this Agreement, Seller identifies, and provides Purchasers with a
reasonable description of, any services or rights required by it which were
provided to a member of the Seller Group by any Company or Company Subsidiary
in the ordinary course of business within six (6) months prior to the date of
this Agreement, but which are not expressly set forth in the Purchaser
Services Schedule (the " _Additional Purchaser Services_ "), Seller may
request the Purchasers to provide such Additional Purchaser Services in which
case the provisions of _Section 3(c)(iv)_ shall apply.

 



 

(iii) The following shall apply in relation to any request for Additional
Seller Services:

 



 

(1) if the requested Additional Seller Services are supplementary or ancillary
to any of the Seller Services set forth in the Seller Services Schedule, the
Separation Plans or the Steps Memo as of the Closing Date and are necessary to
complete the Seller Reorganization and/or to enable Business to continue to
operate in the ordinary course as it had been operating immediately prior to
the Closing (subject to the Seller Reorganization), Seller shall, or cause its
Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers (as defined below) to, provide such
Additional Seller Services to Purchasers (and/or to such other Purchaser
Recipients as Purchasers may direct); or

      
 

 



 

(2) if the requested Additional Seller Services are not of the nature
described in sub-section (1) above, Seller shall consider Purchasers request
in good faith and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or
cause its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers (as defined below) to provide,
such Additional Seller Services to Purchasers (and/or to such other Purchaser
Recipients as Purchasers may direct); provided, Seller shall not be obligated
to provide, and shall not be obligated to cause its Affiliates or Third Party
Suppliers to provide, any Additional Seller Services not of the type described
in sub-section (1) above if in Sellers reasonable judgment: (i) none of
Seller or its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers has adequate resources to
provide such Additional Seller Services; or (ii) the provision of such
Additional Seller Services would: (a) interfere with the operation of Sellers
or its Affiliates business; (b) require a new contract or agreement with, or
amendment or modification to, or waiver under, or extension of, any existing
contract or agreement with a Third Party Supplier; (c) impair the rights or
benefits of, or impose any additional liability or obligation on, or result in
a violation or breach by, or result in the acceleration of any liability or
obligation of, Seller or any of its Affiliates under any contract or
agreement; (d) require capital expenditure on Sellers part; or (e) violate
Applicable Law. Seller shall notify Purchasers within fifteen (15) days of
Sellers receipt of Purchasers request for Additional Seller Services as to
whether it will or will not provide the Additional Seller Services.

 



 

If Seller is required to provide, or agrees to provide (as the case may be),
Additional Seller Services in accordance with sub-sections (1) or (2) above,
then Purchasers and Seller shall in good faith negotiate as soon as reasonably
practicable the terms of a supplement to the Seller Services Schedule which
will describe in reasonable detail the service, scope, term, price and payment
terms to be charged for the Additional Seller Services so as to replicate, in
all material aspects, the basis upon which the Additional Seller Services were
provided to the Business prior to the date of this Agreement. Once agreed to
in writing, the supplement to the Seller Services Schedule shall be deemed
part of this Agreement as of such date and the Additional Seller Services
shall be deemed "Seller Services" provided hereunder, in each case subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and such supplement.

 



 

(iv) The following shall apply in relation to any request for Additional
Purchaser Services:

 



 

(1) if the requested Additional Purchaser Services are supplementary or
ancillary to any of the Purchaser Services set forth in the Purchaser Services
Schedule as of the Closing Date and are necessary to enable any member of the
Seller Group to continue to operate in the ordinary course as it had been
operating immediately prior to the Closing, Purchasers shall, or shall cause
their respective Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers (as defined below) to,
provide such Additional Purchaser Services to Seller (and/or to such other
Seller Recipients as Seller may direct); or

 



 

(2) if the requested Additional Purchaser Services are not of the nature
described in sub-section (1) above, Purchasers shall consider Sellers request
in good faith and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or
shall cause their respective Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers (as defined
below) to provide, such Additional Purchaser Services to Seller (and/or to
such other Seller Recipients as Seller may direct); provided, Purchasers shall
not be obligated to provide, and shall not be obligated to cause their
respective

      
 

 



 

Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers to provide, any Additional Purchaser
Services not of the type described in sub-section (1) above if in Purchasers
reasonable judgment: (i) none of the Purchasers or their respective Affiliates
or Third Party Suppliers has adequate resources to provide such Additional
Purchaser Services; or (ii) the provision of such Additional Purchaser
Services would: (a) interfere with the operation of Purchasers or their
respective Affiliates business; (b) require a new contract or agreement with,
or amendment or modification to, or waiver under, or extension of, any
existing contract or agreement with a Third Party Supplier; (c) impair the
rights or benefits of, or impose any additional liability or obligation on, or
result in a violation or breach by, or result in the acceleration of any
liability or obligation of, Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates
under any contract or agreement; (d) require capital expenditure on any
Purchasers part; or (e) violate Applicable Law. Purchasers shall notify
Seller within fifteen (15) days of Purchasers receipt of Sellers request for
Additional Purchaser Services as to whether either of them will or will not
provide the Additional Purchaser Services.

 



 

If Purchasers are required to provide, or agree to provide (as the case may
be), Additional Purchaser Services in accordance with sub-sections (1) or (2)
above, then Seller and Purchasers shall in good faith negotiate as soon as
reasonably practicable the terms of a supplement to the Purchaser Services
Schedule which will describe in reasonable detail the service, scope, term,
price and payment terms to be charged for the Additional Purchaser Services so
as to replicate, in all material aspects, the basis upon which the Additional
Purchaser Services were provided to the Business prior to the date of this
Agreement. Once agreed to in writing, the supplement to the Purchaser Services
Schedule shall be deemed part of this Agreement as of such date and the
Additional Purchaser Services shall be deemed "Purchaser Services" provided
hereunder, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and such supplement.

 



 

(d) _License of Premises_

 



 

(i) In addition to the Seller Services, Seller shall grant, or shall cause its
relevant Affiliates to grant, to Purchasers and/or to the relevant Purchaser
Recipients, licenses, for the duration of the relevant license periods set out
on _Exhibit 4_ (the " _License Periods_ "), to use for the same use only,
such portions of the office premises listed on _Exhibit 4_ (or, in the case
of the offices and/or residential premises located in (A) South Africa, (B)
the United Kingdom, (C) France and (D) Hong Kong as listed on _Exhibit 4_,
the entirety of each of these premises) as used by Seller or its relevant
Affiliates in the operation of the Business immediately prior to Closing (the
" _Licensed Premises_ "), together with the right to use the common facilities
at each such Licensed Premises and the right to use the Sellers and its
Affiliates equipment (such as photocopiers, scanners, printers, phones and
desks) at such Licensed Premises as used by Seller or its relevant Affiliates
in the operation of the Business immediately prior to Closing, in accordance
with this _Section 1(d)_ (the " _License to Occupy_ ").

 



 

(ii) Each Purchaser shall, or shall cause the relevant Purchaser Recipients
to, pay to Seller or its relevant Affiliates a license fee (the " _License
Fee_ ") in the amount set forth on _Exhibit 4_ for the applicable License to
Occupy from the date of this Agreement through and until the expiration date
of the relevant License Period, such License Fee to be prorated on a per diem
basis for any partial month within the applicable License Period. All payments
shall be due and payable on the first Business Day of each month, with the pro
rata

      
 

 



 

amount due from the date of this Agreement to the end of the month being paid
on the date of this Agreement. The License Fee shall be paid when due, without
demand, offset or abatement.

 



 

(iii) Each Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of the relevant
Purchaser Recipients, acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to examine
the Licensed Premises and is licensing the Licensed Premises and the Licensed
Equipment in its "AS IS/WHERE IS" condition as of the date of this Agreement,
without any obligation on the part of Seller or its Affiliates to make any
improvements thereto or provide to any Purchaser or the relevant Purchaser
Recipients any allowance therefor and without any representation or warranty
whatsoever, including, without limitation, as to the condition thereof or the
suitability thereof for Purchasers and the Purchaser Recipients purposes.

 



 

(iv) Purchasers agree to remove, or to cause the relevant Purchaser Recipients
to remove, all goods and equipment which they own from each Licensed Premises
and vacate the Licensed Premises on expiry or termination of the relevant
License Period without notice or demand. No Purchaser nor any Purchaser
Recipient shall have any right or option to renew or extend the terms of the
License Periods. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any
time during the applicable License Period the Sellers or its Affiliates
right to possession of the Licensed Premises is terminated, the License to
Occupy for such Licensed Premises shall terminate as of the same date.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding any operation of law or otherwise, neither Purchasers nor
any other Purchaser Recipient shall acquire any right or title in the Licensed
Premises (including any leasehold interest) and the Parties expressly
acknowledge that they intend to create only a license and not a lease of the
Licensed Premises.

 



 

(vi) Purchasers agree and undertake, and shall procure the same of the other
Purchaser Recipients: (A) to follow any reasonable security, health and safety
and other procedures prevailing in respect of the Licensed Premises and
Licensed Equipment as are notified to them by Seller from time to time; (B) to
ensure that their personnel use the Licensed Premises and Licensed Equipment
in accordance with this Agreement; (C) to use commercially reasonable efforts
not to cause, and to procure that none of their personnel cause, any damage to
the Licensed Premises or Licensed Equipment; (D) not to make any alterations
or additions to the Licensed Premises; (E) not to remove any fixtures and
fittings within the Licensed Premises; (F) to keep the Licensed Premises clean
and tidy and clear of rubbish and to leave them in as good a state of repair
and decoration as they are at the Closing Date; (G) not to obstruct the common
areas and facilities at the Licensed Premises nor cause them to become dirty
or untidy nor to leave any rubbish on them; (H) not to use the Licensed
Premises in such a way as would or might constitute a breach of any statutory
requirement affecting the Licensed Premises or which would or might vitiate in
whole or in part any insurance effected in respect of the Licensed Premises
from time to time and to comply with the requirements of any insurance policy
in place from time to time in respect of the Licensed Premises; (I) not to
charge, assign, underlet or part with possession or occupation of, nor to
share possession or occupation of, the whole or any part of or any interest in
the Licensed Premises; (J) to co-operate with Seller as may reasonably be
required to ensure the security of the Licensed Premises and to prevent the
entry of unauthorized persons; (K) not to impede in any way Sellers or its
Affiliates personnel in the exercise of their rights of possession and
control of the Licensed Premises or impede

      
 

 



 

Sellers or its Affiliates ability to operate their business at the Licensed
Premises; (L) to not cause a default (irrespective of any notice and/or cure
periods) under any Applicable Lease where the applicable terms of that lease
have been notified to Purchasers (it being acknowledged that copies of the
Applicable Leases have been provided to the Purchasers prior to the date of
this Agreement), provided that the parties acknowledge that the occupation of
the Licensed Premises under the Licenses to Occupy by the Business in
accordance with this _Section 1(d)_ and in a manner which is consistent with
the manner in which the Licensed Premises were occupied during the period
immediately prior to Closing shall not be deemed to constitute a default for
the purposes of this subsection (L), irrespective of the terms of any
Applicable Lease; and (M) to maintain insurance as required by the Applicable
Lease, which insurance shall name Seller or its applicable Affiliate as an
additional insured.

 



 

(vii) Purchaser and the Purchaser Recipients shall defend, indemnify and save
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties against and from all Losses which may
be imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against the Seller Indemnified
Parties by reason of any of the following which shall occur: (i) any work or
act done in, on or about the Licensed Premises or any part thereof following
the Closing Date at the direction of Purchasers, the Purchaser Recipients or
their respective agents, employees or contractors (the " _Purchaser Parties_
"); (ii) any negligence or other wrongful act or omission on the part of any
Purchaser Parties in relation to the Licenses to Occupy; (iii) any accident,
injury or damage to any person (including any Purchaser Parties) or property
occurring in or on the Licensed Premises or any part thereof following the
Closing Date, unless caused by Seller or any of its Affiliates; (iii) any
failure on the part of any Purchaser Party to perform or comply with any of
the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions, conditions or limitations
contained in this sub-section (d) to be performed or complied with; and (iv)
any failure of Purchaser Parties to vacate the Licensed Premises at the end of
the applicable License Period without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



 

(viii) In the event of a breach or default by any Purchaser or Purchaser
Recipient under this _Section 1(d)_, Seller or its relevant Affiliate may, in
addition to exercising any rights or remedies available at law or in equity,
terminate the applicable License to Occupy by notice to the Purchasers (or the
Purchaser Recipient); provided, that, (1) with respect to any breach of or
default under this _Section 1(d)_ due to a failure to pay any Licensee Fee on
the date such Licensee Fee is due, Purchasers (or the Purchaser Recipient)
shall first be given a five (5) Business Day grace period from the date on
which Purchasers (or the relevant Purchaser Recipient) receive written notice
from Seller (or its relevant Affiliate) of such failure to pay; and (2) with
respect to any breach of or default under this _Section 1(d)_ for any reason
other than as described in sub-section (1) of this _Section 1(d)(iii)_,
Purchasers (or the Purchaser Recipient) shall first be given the right to cure
such breach or default that, in Sellers reasonable discretion, is capable of
being cured within twenty one (21) days of receipt by Purchasers (or the
Purchaser Recipient) of written notice from Seller (or its relevant Affiliate)
of such breach or default. Without limiting the foregoing, if Purchaser or any
Service Recipient breaches or defaults under any provision of this _Section
1(d)_, Seller or its relevant Affiliate may cure such default at the expense
of Purchasers and the Purchaser Recipients and the reasonable amount of all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by Seller or its
relevant Affiliate in so doing shall be deemed additional License Fees payable
on demand.

      
 

 



 

(e) _Standard and Manner of Performance_.

 



 

(i) Each Party providing services (the " _Service Provider_ ") shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates and Third Party Suppliers (as defined below) to, provide
to the other Party (the " _Service Recipient_ ") the Services to be provided
by such Service Provider with reasonable skill and care (including through
suitably skilled, experienced, and licensed personnel) in a professional
manner and in compliance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and without limiting any other provision of this Agreement (including any
schedule, exhibit or appendix hereto), unless otherwise agreed by the Parties
in writing, the nature, scope and/or standard of care shall be no less than
that which was provided to the Business (in the case of Seller Services) or to
the Seller Group (in the case of Purchaser Services) in the ordinary course in
the six (6) months immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Unless
otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing and save to the extent that the
provision of Seller Services to complete the Seller Reorganization in
accordance with the Steps Memo and the Separation Plans, Seller and its
Affiliates and Third Party Suppliers shall be required to provide the Seller
Services only for the benefit of the Purchaser Recipients, and only to the
same scope, and only for the same volume of Seller Services, and only to the
same Companies and Company Subsidiaries that such Seller Services were
provided to the Business in the ordinary course in the six (6) months
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) In respect of those Services, if any, which are provided on a Service
Providers behalf by a sub-contractor or other third party (each a " _Third
Party Supplier_ ") to the Service Recipient or any of its Affiliates, Service
Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, on a pass-through
basis, cause such Third Party Supplier to provide such Services for the
benefit of the Receiving Party (and such other Purchaser Recipients or Seller
Recipients as Purchasers or Seller, as applicable, may from time to time
direct) in the same manner and to the same standards (including as to service
levels, if any) and with the same assurances and other contractual protections
(including as to confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions) as the Service
Provider or its Affiliates receives from the relevant Third Party Supplier in
the applicable sub-contract or contract between the Service Provider or the
relevant Affiliate and that Third Party Supplier. Without prejudice to the
foregoing, each Service Recipient shall, during the Term, comply with, and
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Service Provider (which
such consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Service Provider), seek
to terminate, amend, waive, modify or restate any such contracts.

 



 

(iii) Unless otherwise explicitly set forth in the Seller Services Schedule,
the Separation Plans or the Steps Memo, Seller shall not, nor shall any of its
Affiliates, be required to expand or modify any facilities, incur any capital
expenditures, acquire any additional equipment or software or retain any
specific personnel or Third Party Suppliers in connection with its obligation
to provide the Seller Services. Unless otherwise set forth in the Purchaser
Services Schedule, Purchasers shall not, nor shall any of their Affiliates, be
required to expand or modify any facilities, incur any capital expenditures,
acquire any additional equipment or software or retain any specific personnel
or Third Party Suppliers in connection with their obligation to provide the
Purchaser Services.

 



 

(iv) Seller shall be responsible for the security of the accounts, files,
data, information, assets, system(s), technical resources and hardware
(collectively, " _Computer Systems_ ") to which it, and each of its
Affiliates, provides access to Purchasers or any other Purchaser Recipient in
the course of providing the Seller Services; provided, however, that Seller

      
 

 



 

shall not be responsible for any damage, breach or other harm to any of its or
its Affiliates Computer Systems if such damage, breach or harm is caused by
an act or omission of any Purchaser Recipient or its employees, independent
contractors or representatives. Purchasers shall be responsible for the
security of the Computer Systems to which they, or any other Purchaser
Recipients, provide access to Seller or its Affiliates in the course of
providing the Seller Services; provided, however, that Purchasers shall not be
responsible for any damage, breach or other harm to their or any other
Purchaser Recipients Computer Systems if such damage, breach or harm is
caused by an act or omission of Seller or any of its Affiliates or their
respective employees, independent contractors or representatives. Each Party
shall limit access to the other Partys Computer Systems solely to the use of
such Computer Systems for purposes of providing (in the case of Seller and its
Affiliates) or receiving (in the case of Purchasers and the other Purchaser
Recipients) Seller Services and shall not access or attempt to access any of
such other Partys Computer Systems other than those required for the Seller
Services, or those that are publicly available. Each Party shall limit such
access to those of its Third Party Suppliers, employees, independent
contractors or representatives with a bona fide need to have such access in
connection with the Seller Services, and shall follow all the other Partys
security rules and procedures for restricting access to its Computer Systems
in effect as of the date of this Agreement. All usernames (or other
identification data), pins and passwords disclosed to a Party and any
information obtained by such Party as a result of such Partys access to and
use of the other Partys Computer Systems shall be deemed to be, and treated
as, Confidential Information hereunder. Without prejudice to its other
obligations under this Agreement, the Parties and their respective Affiliates
shall have the right to implement reasonable processes to protect their and
their Affiliates information technology operating environment. If, in
connection with the Seller Services, any Party (or Affiliate thereof) deems it
necessary to implement any information technology connections, firewalls or
the like specifically in connection with such Seller Services, the costs of
implementing such measures shall be borne by such Party. Each Party shall not,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to, tamper with, compromise or
circumvent any safety, security or audit measures employed by the other Party
with respect to its Computer Systems. The Parties shall cooperate in the
investigation of any apparent unauthorized access to either Partys Computer
Systems.

 



 

(v) Service Provider may perform its obligations under this Agreement through
one or more of its Affiliates, and each of the foregoing may hire or rely upon
Third Party Suppliers to perform any of Service Providers obligations
hereunder, including to provide all or part of any Service to be provided by
it hereunder, provided that Service Provider shall remain ultimately
responsible for the provision of the Services to be provided by it hereunder
and all of its obligations hereunder. Service Recipient acknowledges and
agrees that the Services provided by Service Provider or its Affiliates
through Third Party Suppliers, or using third party assets, including
Intellectual Property, are subject to the terms and conditions of any
applicable agreements with such third parties. Without prejudice to the
provisions of the Purchase Agreement, if any consent, authorization, order,
approval or exemption (a " _Third Party Consent_ ") is required to be obtained
or made with respect to any third party relationship to enable the provision
or receipt of the Services hereunder, excluding any Third Party Consents which
are required in order to carry out any of the actions described in the Steps
Memo, the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in
good faith to obtain them. Service Provider and its Affiliates shall be liable
for the costs of obtaining any such Third Party Consents. Without prejudice to
the foregoing, if the Parties are unable to obtain any Third Party

      
 

 



 

Consent, they shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) negotiate in
good faith reasonable modifications of the Services such that such Third Party
Consent is not required and (B) implement such modifications. Service Provider
will not be in breach of this Agreement as a result of any non-performance of,
or other effect upon, any applicable Services as a result of any failure to
obtain any such consent, so long as it has otherwise complied with this
_Section 1(e)(v)_.

 



 

(vi) Without prejudice to its obligations under this Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates shall have sole discretion and authority with respect to
designating, employing, assigning, compensating, removing, replacing and
discharging their respective personnel and Third Party Suppliers in connection
with performance of the Seller Services.

 



 

(f) The Parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the Services.
Accordingly, as promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, and in the case of Purchasers, subject to the completion of the
Seller Reorganization, Service Recipients shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to make a transition of each applicable Service to their
own internal organization or to obtain alternate third party sources to
provide such Services and to terminate such transitioned Services in
accordance with _Section 3_. Without prejudice to Sellers obligations to pay
the Separation Costs in accordance with _Section 1(g)_ below and subject to
the provisions of the Services Schedules, each Service Provider agrees during
the Term to provide the applicable Service Recipients, at the sole cost and
expense of the Service Recipients (to be charged on a time and materials basis
at the hourly rates set out in the applicable Services Schedule (" _Time and
Materials Basis_ "), with such reasonable co-operation, together with such
data and information, as Service Recipients may reasonably request in writing
to assist them with the making of any arrangements for the applicable Services
to be provided in-house by them or the procurement of services substantially
the same as the Services from an alternative services provider and to achieve
an orderly transition and handover of the Services. Where Services are
provided by a Third Party Supplier and where requested by a Service Recipient,
Service Provider shall use all reasonable endeavors, at the sole cost and
expense of the Service Recipient on a Time and Materials Basis (provided that
such costs are not Separation Costs or other costs for which Seller is liable
under this Agreement), to facilitate direct commercial discussions between
such Third Party Supplier and such Service Recipient in order to enable the
Services provided by such Third Party Supplier to continue to be provided to
the Service Recipient following the termination or expiry of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Seller acknowledges and agrees that it shall be liable for and shall pay
in a timely manner (and shall not seek reimbursement from Purchasers or the
other Purchaser Recipients in respect of) all costs and expenses incurred or
required to be incurred by Seller in undertaking the actions necessary to
complete the Seller Reorganization (" _Separation Costs_ "), including
(without limitation) the IT Separation, in accordance with this Agreement, the
Steps Memo and the Separation Plans; provided, for the avoidance of doubt,
that Seller shall not be liable under this _Section 1(g)_ for any ongoing or
recurring costs or expenses of the Business following the implementation of
the Seller Reorganization.

 



 

(h) Each Party shall designate one individual to be the primary liaison
between the Parties for the provision of and the transfer of responsibility
for the Seller Services (each, a " _Service Manager_ "). A Party may replace
its Service Manager at any time upon written

      
 

 



 

notice to the other Party. Seller hereby designates **[ ]** as its
initial Service Manager and Purchasers hereby designate **[ ]** as
their initial Service Manager.

 



 

(i) The Parties agree to comply with the provisions of _Section 7.8_ (
_Wrong Pockets_ ) of the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

2. _Term_. This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and, unless earlier terminated or extended as set forth in _Section 3_, shall continue in respect of each Service until its scheduled expiry date (if applicable, as set out in the Seller Services Schedule or Purchaser Services Schedule). In the case of any Seller Services required to be performed as part of the Seller Reorganization (each being a " _Seller Reorganization Item_ "), this Agreement shall continue until all actions relating to that Seller Reorganization Item, as set out in the Seller Services Schedule, the Steps Memo and/or the Separation Plans, have been completed in accordance with this Agreement, the Seller Services Schedule, the Steps Memo and/or the Separation Plans, as applicable. For these purposes (and for the avoidance of doubt), references in the Seller Services Schedule to Seller Reorganization Items being undertaken "within [x] months of the Closing Date" are indicative timeframes only and shall not excuse Seller from its obligation to complete such actions if, despite Sellers commercially reasonable efforts, they have not been completed within the period set out in the Seller Services Schedule.

 



 

3. _Termination; Suspension of Services_.

 



 

(a) Any Service may be terminated, in whole or in part, at any time upon the
mutual written agreement of the Parties.

 



 

(b) Purchasers may terminate any Seller Service in its entirety only at any
time upon written notification to Seller at least thirty (30) days (or such
longer period as may be set forth in the Seller Services Schedule with respect
to such Seller Service) in advance of such termination. Seller may terminate
any Purchaser Service in its entirety only at any time upon written
notification to Purchasers at least thirty (30) days (or such longer period as
may be set forth in the Purchaser Services Schedule with respect to such
Purchaser Service) in advance of such termination.

 



 

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by: (i) Seller upon written notice to
Purchasers in the event Purchasers fail to make any payment as provided for in
this Agreement within ten (10) days following delivery of written notice of
such failure by Seller to Purchasers, provided that no _bona fide_ dispute
with respect to such payment has been made pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ and
remains unresolved; or (ii) by either Party upon written notice to the other
Party (A) upon a material breach of any of the terms of this Agreement by the
other Party (other than a breach covered by sub-section (i) of this _Section
3(c)_) if such breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after
written notice of such breach is delivered by the non-breaching Party to the
breaching Party; or (B) if such other Party files a proceeding in bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation or reorganization, or for composition,
liquidation or dissolution or for similar relief, or there is a filing against
such Party of any such proceeding which is not dismissed within thirty (30)
days after the filing thereof.

       
 

 



 

(d) In the event that Purchasers desire to extend any Seller Service (which is
not a Seller Reorganization Item) beyond the scheduled expiry date of such
Seller Service solely for the purpose of providing for the orderly transition
and handover of the Seller Services to Purchasers (or to the applicable
Purchaser Recipient(s)) or to their nominated replacement service provider (an
" _Extended Seller Service_ "), Purchasers shall provide Seller with written
notice of such desire no less than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled
expiry date of such Seller Service. Such written notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail each Seller Service for which the Purchasers desire to
extend the term and the requested extension period for each such Seller
Service. Seller shall agree to any reasonable request from Purchasers to
extend the term of a Seller Service described in such written notice where
there have been no previous extensions of such Seller Service and the
requested extension set forth in such written notice is for a period of not
more than thirty (30) days (save where Purchasers request for an extension of
a Seller Service is due to Purchasers being unable to (despite using
commercially reasonable efforts) recruit new employees to take over the
provision of the applicable Seller Service within the time available, in which
case Seller shall agree to extend the term of such Seller Service for a period
of not more than sixty (60) days, subject to Purchasers agreeing to pay, and
in fact paying, to Seller the aggregate amount of all Exceptional Extension
Costs (as defined below) payable during the term of such extension period (an
" _Exceptional Extension_ ")). In circumstances where Purchasers request an
extension of a Seller Service for a period of more than thirty (30) days (or
sixty (60) days in the case of an Exceptional Extension), or where the request
is for less than that period but the Seller Service has already been extended
one or more times previously, Seller shall consider such request in good faith
and, if Seller determines (acting reasonably and in good faith) to provide
such Seller Service beyond the scheduled expiry date of such Seller Service,
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or shall cause
its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers (as defined below) to provide, such
Extended Seller Service; provided, Seller shall not be obligated to provide,
and shall not be obligated to cause its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers to
provide, any Extended Seller Service if in Sellers reasonable judgment (i)
none of Seller or its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers has adequate
resources to provide such Extended Seller Service; or (ii) the provision of
such Extended Seller Service would (A) interfere with the operation of
Sellers or its Affiliates business; (B) require a new contract or agreement
with, or amendment or modification to, or waiver under, or extension of, any
existing contract or agreement with a Third Party Supplier; (C) impair the
rights or benefits of, or impose any additional liability or obligation on, or
result in a violation or breach by, or result in the acceleration of any
liability or obligation of, Seller or any of its Affiliates under any contract
or agreement; (D) require capital expenditure on Sellers part; or (E) violate
Applicable Law. Seller shall notify Purchasers within fifteen (15) days of
Sellers receipt of Purchasers written notice delivered pursuant to this
_Section 3(d)_ as to whether it will or will not provide the Extended Seller
Service. Except as set forth on the Seller Services Schedule, the price,
payment terms and any other relevant provisions relating to any Extended
Seller Service shall remain the same as provided for in the Seller Services
Schedule unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing. " _Exceptional
Extension Costs_ " means the aggregate amount of all (i) salaries and other
compensation, (ii) costs of benefits (including accrued gratuities), (iii)
employer contributions, costs and tax obligations, and (iv) reasonable and
properly allocated overhead charges for payroll administration, in each case,
that are payable or incurred by Seller (or its relevant Subsidiary) during the
Exceptional Extension period with respect to each employee of Seller (or its
relevant

      
 

 



 

Subsidiary) that is tasked with performing the Extended Service that is
subject of such Exceptional Extension.

 



 

(e) In the event that Seller desires to extend any Purchaser Service beyond
the scheduled expiry date of such Purchaser Service, Seller shall provide
Purchasers with written notice of such desire no less than thirty (30) days
prior to the scheduled expiry date of such Purchaser Service (an " _Extended
Purchaser Service_ "). Such written notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail each Purchaser Service for which Seller desires to extend the term and
the requested extension period for each such Purchaser Service. Purchasers
shall agree to any reasonable request from Seller to extend the term of a
Purchaser Service described in such written notice where there have been no
previous extensions of such Purchaser Service and the requested extension set
forth in such written notice is for a period of not more than thirty (30)
days. In circumstances where Seller requests an extension of a Purchaser
Service for a period of more than thirty (30) days, or where the request is
for less than thirty (30) days but the Purchaser Service has already been
extended one or more times previously, Purchasers shall consider such request
in good faith and, if Purchasers determine (acting reasonably and in good
faith) to provide such Purchaser Service beyond the scheduled expiry date of
such Purchaser Service, Purchasers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide, or cause their Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers (as defined
above) to provide, such Extended Purchaser Service; provided, Purchasers shall
not be obligated to provide, and shall not be obligated to cause their
respective Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers to provide, any Extended
Purchaser Service if in Purchasers reasonable judgment: (i) neither of
Purchasers or their respective Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers has
adequate resources to provide such Extended Purchaser Service; or (ii) the
provision of such Extended Purchaser Service would (A) interfere with the
operation of Purchasers or their Affiliates business; (B) require a new
contract or agreement with, or amendment or modification to, or waiver under,
or extension of, any existing contract or agreement with a Third Party
Supplier; (C) impair the rights or benefits of, or impose any additional
liability or obligation on, or result in a violation or breach by, or result
in the acceleration of any liability or obligation of, Purchasers or any of
their respective Affiliates under any contract or agreement; (D) require
capital expenditure on any Purchasers part; or (E) violate Applicable Law.
Purchasers shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days Purchasers receipt of
Sellerss written notice delivered pursuant to this _Section 3(e)_ as to
whether they will or will not provide the Extended Purchaser Service. The
price, payment terms and any other relevant provisions relating to any
Extended Purchaser Service shall remain the same as provided for in the
Purchaser Services Schedule unless the Parties agree otherwise in writing.

 



 

(f) The expiration or termination of any Service or this Agreement shall not
relieve any Party of any obligations or extinguish any rights of any Party
that have accrued to either Party prior to such expiration or termination. For
the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall have any obligation to pay any future
compensation relating to terminated Services (other than for or in respect of
Services already provided in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior
to such termination). In no event shall Purchasers or any other Purchaser
Recipient be liable for any Seller Personnel termination costs or claims
arising from the expiration or termination of this Agreement (in whole or in
part). Seller shall indemnify and keep indemnified Purchasers and the other
Purchaser Recipients in full and on demand at all times from and against any
Losses which Purchasers and the other Purchaser Recipients may in any way
incur or suffer as a result of any employee or former employee of Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Third

      
 

 



 

Party Suppliers (other than former employees of the Seller Group which have
become employees of the Business in accordance with the Purchase Agreement)
making any claim against Purchasers or another of the Purchaser Recipients
that they have become an employee of Purchasers or another Purchaser Recipient
or a claim in respect of wrongful dismissal, unfair dismissal, redundancy or a
failure to duly inform and consult employees or their representatives or
otherwise under any Applicable Laws, which claim is made against Purchasers or
another Purchaser Recipient on the basis that, by virtue of the termination or
expiration of this Agreement (in whole or in part), that individuals
employment has transferred to Purchasers or the relevant Purchaser Recipient.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any such employee or former
employee or Seller or any of its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers asserting
that they have become an employee of Purchasers or another of the Purchaser
Recipients, Purchasers or the relevant Purchaser Recipient shall be entitled
to terminate such employment with immediate effect and without notice and to
rely on the indemnity given in this _Section 3(f)_.

 



 

(g) In the event the Service Recipient fails to make any payment as provided
for in this Agreement within ten (10) days following delivery of written
notice of such failure by the Service Provider to the Service Recipient,
provided that no _bona fide_ dispute with respect to such payment has been
made pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ and remains unresolved, the Service Provider
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, upon ten (10) Business Days
prior written notice, to suspend performance of all of the Services for which
it is the Service Provider (being either the Seller Services or the Purchaser
Services, as applicable) until payment shall have been received. The Service
Providers election to suspend performance of the Services pursuant to this
_Section 3(g)_ shall not be deemed to (i) constitute a breach of this
Agreement, (ii) prohibit or limit the Service Providers right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 3(c)_ or pursue or enforce any
other rights or remedies it may have against the Service Recipient, or (iii)
waive any obligation or covenant of the Service Recipient.

 



 

(h) The following provisions shall survive the expiration or termination of
this Agreement: _Section 1(d)(vii)_, _Section 3(f)_, _Section 3(g)_, this
_Section 3(h)_, _Section 5(c)_, _Section 5(d)_, _Section 5(e)_, _Section
6_, _Section 7_, _Section 8_, _Section 9_, _Section 10_, _Section 11_,
_Section 12_, _Section 13(b)(ii)_ and _Section 14_, and any other provision
that expressly provides that it shall survive such expiration or termination.

 



 

4. _Fees_.

 



 

(a) Purchasers shall pay to Seller a fee for each Seller Service in the amount
set forth opposite such Seller Service on the Seller Services Schedule (the
fee, if any, for a particular Seller Service a " _Seller Service Fee_ " and,
collectively, " _Seller Service Fees_ "). In addition to the Seller Service
Fees and to the extent not already forming part of the Seller Service Fees or
Separation Costs, Purchasers shall reimburse Seller for all pre-approved (by
Purchasers), out-of-pocket costs and expenses from third parties actually
incurred by Seller in the provision of the Seller Services to Purchasers (the
" _Third Party Costs_ "). If at any time Seller believes that the Seller
Service Fee contemplated by a specific Seller Service in the Seller Services
Schedule is, or the Seller Services Fees in the aggregate are, insufficient to
compensate it for the cost of providing such Seller Service or the Seller
Services, Seller shall notify Purchasers as soon as possible, and the Parties
will commence good-faith negotiations toward an agreement in writing as to the
appropriate course of action with respect to provision and/or pricing of such
Seller

      
 

 



 

Service or the Seller Services for future periods, provided, that Seller
acknowledges and confirms that: (i) as of the date hereof, Seller believes the
Seller Service Fees applicable to each Seller Service and in the aggregate are
sufficient to compensate it for the costs of providing the Seller Services;
and (ii) nothing in this _Section 4(a)_ shall entitle Seller to recover any
Separation Costs, directly or indirectly.

 



 

(b) Seller shall pay to Purchasers a fee for each Purchaser Service in the
amount set forth opposite such Purchaser Service on the Purchaser Services
Schedule (the fee, if any, for a particular Purchaser Service a " _Purchaser
Service Fee_ " and, collectively, " _Purchaser Service Fees_ "). In addition
to the Purchaser Service Fees and to the extent not already forming part of
the Purchaser Service Fees, Seller shall reimburse Purchasers for all pre-
approved (by Seller), out-of-pocket costs and expenses from third parties
actually incurred by Purchasers in the provision of the Purchaser Services to
Seller (the " _Third Party Costs_ "). If at any time Purchasers believe that
the Purchaser Service Fee contemplated by a specific Purchaser Service in the
Purchaser Services Schedule is, or the Purchaser Services Fees in the
aggregate are, insufficient to compensate it for the cost of providing such
Purchaser Service or the Purchaser Services, Purchasers shall notify Seller as
soon as possible, and the Parties will commence good-faith negotiations toward
an agreement in writing as to the appropriate course of action with respect to
provision and/or pricing of such Purchaser Service or the Purchaser Services
for future periods, provided, that Purchasers acknowledge and confirm that as
of the date hereof, Purchasers believe the Purchaser Service Fees applicable
to each Purchaser Service and in the aggregate are sufficient to compensate it
for the costs of providing the Purchaser Services.

 



 

5. _Payment Terms_.

 



 

(a) Not later than thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month
during the Term, each Service Provider shall submit to the applicable Service
Recipient in writing an invoice setting out in reasonable detail each Service
performed by the Service Provider and its Affiliates and Third Party Suppliers
during the preceding calendar month and the related Service Fee and, if
applicable, any Third Party Costs incurred by the Service Provider or its
Affiliates in connection therewith (including with such Service Providers
invoice reasonable supporting documentation, including extracts of relevant
third party invoices). The Service Recipient shall pay the Service Provider
all invoiced charges in full promptly on receipt of each invoice, but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice. Except in the
event that the Service Recipient gives the Service Provider written notice of
a _bona fide_ dispute with respect to any charges in accordance in accordance
with _Section 5(b)_, if the Service Recipient fails to pay any invoiced
charges by such date, the Service Recipient shall be obligated to pay to the
Service Provider, in addition to the amount due, interest from and including
the date such payment is due at an interest rate of two percent (2%) over the
prime rate in effect during such period, as published in the eastern edition
of _The Wall Street Journal_ or a comparable newspaper if _The Wall Street
Journal_ shall cease publishing the prime rate. Such interest shall be payable
at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on
the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

 



 

(b) The Service Recipient will give the Service Provider written notice of any
disputed charges within ten (10) days following receipt of the invoice
reflecting such charges, along with a description of the nature of the dispute

excises, fees or other charges in each case in the nature of taxation
(including any sales, use, goods and services, value added or similar taxes)

assets.

The terms of this Agreement are not intended to cause any of the Parties or its Affiliates to become a joint employer for any purpose. Each of the Parties agrees that the provisions of this Agreement as a whole are not intended to, and do not, constitute control of the other Party or any Affiliates thereof or provide it with the ability to control such other Party or any Affiliates thereof, and each Party hereto expressly disclaims any right or power under this Agreement to exercise any power whatsoever over the management or policies of the other Party or any Affiliates thereof.

 



 

8. _Status of Employees and Facilities_. Whenever a Party utilizes its (or its Affiliates or a Third Party Suppliers) employees to perform Services pursuant to this Agreement, such employees shall at all times remain subject to the direction and control of such Party or such Affiliate or third party, and the other Party shall have no liability to such Persons for their welfare, salaries, fringe benefits, unemployment insurance, workers compensation insurance payments, disability benefits, legally-required employer contributions and tax obligations by virtue of the relationships established under this Agreement. No equipment or facility of Seller used in performing the Seller Services for Purchasers and their Affiliates shall be deemed to be transferred, assigned, conveyed or leased by such performance or use.

 



 

9. _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement is
intended to transfer any right, title, or interest in and to any tangible,
intangible, real or personal property (including any and all Intellectual
Property Rights) except as specifically set forth herein. Notwithstanding any
materials, data, information or other products that may be created or
developed by a Party or its Affiliates from the date hereof through the
expiration or termination of the Term, no Party hereby conveys, nor does the
other Party or any of its Affiliates hereby obtain, any right, title, or
interest in or to any of such Partys or any of its Affiliates equipment,
materials, products, data or any other rights or property used to provide the
Services. All customer and personnel data, files and input and output

_Redirected URLs_ ") and the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in
order to maintain the URL Redirection, the Redirected URLs must remain live,
validly registered and within the control of Seller or its Affiliates. Seller

Redirected URLs, for a minimum period of twenty four (24) months from the
Closing Date; and

      
 

 



 

(ii) a suitable notice on the homepage of the Sellers main website indicating

(a) Except as otherwise required under Applicable Law, each Party hereto
agrees that it shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain as
confidential any and all information provided by or on behalf of either Party
to the other, or otherwise obtained by such Party or its Affiliates after the
date hereof in connection with or as a result of this Agreement. The Parties
further agree to cooperate with each other, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, to develop and implement security and file guarding procedures
that are designed to maintain the integrity of the Parties confidential
information and proprietary systems and software. Nothing contained in this
_Section 10(a)_ shall limit or affect in any way obligations of the Parties
or their respective Affiliates to maintain the confidentiality of information
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 10(a)_, each Party and its
Affiliates may disclose confidential information to each other and to their
own personnel and to the personnel of its Third Party Suppliers to the extent
required for the proper performance of this Agreement, conditional upon any
such personnel being informed of the confidential nature of the information
and the relevant Party using its commercially reasonably efforts to cause such
personnel to comply with the provision of _Section 10(a)_ as if it were a
party to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If a Party becomes legally compelled to disclose any confidential
information disclosed by the other Party, the receiving Party shall provide
(i) prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing Party may
seek, at its sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy, and
(ii) reasonable assistance, at the disclosing Partys sole cost and expense,
in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations
on disclosure. If, after providing such notice and assistance as required
herein, the receiving Party remains required by Applicable Law to disclose any
confidential information of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall
disclose no more than that portion of the confidential information which the
receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, upon the disclosing
Partys request, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances from the applicable court or agency that such confidential
information will be afforded confidential treatment.

      
 

 



 

(d) If either Party becomes aware of any breach of confidence or unauthorized
use of confidential information by any of its personnel, it shall promptly
notify the other Party.

 



 

(e) Immediately following the expiration or termination of this Agreement,

to do so by the other Party either (i) provide to the disclosing Party all of
the disclosing Partys confidential information and other data and materials
which is then such Partys (or its Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers)
control or possession; or (ii) at the written request of the disclosing Party,
destroy or delete such confidential information and shall confirm to the
disclosing Party in writing that it has done so.

 



 

11. _Limitation of Liability; Indemnity; Disclaimer of Warranty_.

 



 

(a) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, SELLER,
ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF ITS AFFILIATES, HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SELLER SERVICES, WHETHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN REGARD TO QUALITY,
PERFORMANCE, NONINFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
OF THE SELLER SERVICES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability in contract, tort (including negligence)
or otherwise, for or in connection with any Seller Services rendered or to be
rendered by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions or
inactions of Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with any such
Seller Services, to any Purchaser Indemnified Party, except to the extent that
a Purchaser Indemnified Party suffers, sustains or becomes subject to any
losses, claims, liabilities, damages or expenses (" _Losses_ ") that result
from Sellers or any of its Affiliates breach of this Agreement, or
negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the provision of any such
Seller Services, transactions, actions or inactions. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, neither Purchaser nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall have any liability in contract, tort (including negligence) or
otherwise, for or in connection with any Purchaser Services rendered or to be
rendered by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions or inactions of any Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with any such Purchaser Services, to any
Seller Indemnified Party, except to the extent that a Seller Indemnified Party
suffers, sustains or becomes subject to any Losses that result from any
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates breach of this Agreement,
or negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the provision of any
such Seller Services, transactions, actions or inactions.

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall defend, indemnify,
and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against all
Losses which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may actually suffer, sustain or
become subject to resulting from, arising out of, or based upon the provision
of the Seller Services, or otherwise in respect of, any material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking made by Seller

      
 

 



 

pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that, (x) claims for indemnification
made pursuant to this _Section 11(c)_ with respect to the provision of Seller
Services hereunder shall be limited to, in the aggregate, the total amount of
Seller Service Fees paid or payable to Seller hereunder, save that no such cap
shall apply in connection with: (i) sums for which Seller is liable under the
Purchase Agreement (except to the extent set forth in the Purchase Agreement)
and _Section 1(g)_ in respect of the Seller Reorganization; (ii) sums for
which the Seller is liable pursuant to _Section 1(e)(v)_, (iii) claims for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 3(f)_, or (iv) as a result of the fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates; and
(y) in no event will Seller (or any of its Affiliates) be liable to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party for any special, indirect or consequential Losses,
whether arising in contract, tort (including a Partys negligence) or
otherwise.

 



 

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, Purchasers shall defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
all Losses which any Seller Indemnified Party may suffer or sustain or become
subject to resulting from, arising out of, or based upon the provision of the
Purchaser Services, or otherwise in respect of, any material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking made by any Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement; provided that, (x) claims for indemnification made
pursuant to this _Section 11(d)_ with respect to the provision of Purchaser
Services hereunder shall be limited to, in the aggregate, the total amount of
Purchaser Service Fees paid or payable to Seller hereunder; save that no such
cap shall apply in connection with: (i) claims for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 1(d)(vii)_ or _Section 13(b)(i)_, or (ii) as a result of the fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates; and
(y) in no event will Purchasers (or any of their Affiliates) be liable to any
Seller Indemnified Party for any special, indirect or consequential Losses,
whether arising in contract, tort (including a Partys negligence) or
otherwise.

 



 

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall take
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of
any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 



 

(f) In the event Seller (or any Seller Indemnified Party) or Purchasers (or
any Purchaser Indemnified Party), as applicable (an " _Indemnitee_ "), shall
have a claim for indemnity against the other Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ")
under the terms of this Agreement arising out of a third party claim, the
Parties shall follow the procedures set forth in Section 8.6 of the Purchase
Agreement as if fully set forth herein.

 



 

(g) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this Agreement
shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit (as defined in Section 8.7 of
the Purchase Agreement) received by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates on
account of such Loss and (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of direct collection
expenses) or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by
the Indemnitee from any third party with respect thereto. If the Indemnitee
receives a Tax Benefit on account of any Loss after an indemnification payment
is made to it with respect to such Loss, the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to
the Indemnitor the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to
the extent that such Tax Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnitee. The
Indemnitee shall seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any
Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to

      
 

 



 

indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is
made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has
been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery less any costs of recovery or any taxes incurred on the amount
recovered shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor. The Indemnitors shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees and their Affiliates in respect of
any Losses indemnified by the Indemnitors.

 



 

(h) Except as expressly provided in _Section 1(d)(viii)_ and _Section
11(i)_, the indemnifications provided by _Section 1(d)(vii)_, _Section
3(f)_, _Section 11(c)_, and _Section 11(d)_, shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any Loss incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the
Seller Indemnified Parties (as the case may be) with respect to any
misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representations or
warranties or any breach or failure in performance of any covenants or
agreements made by Seller or Purchasers in this Agreement or in any exhibit or
schedules hereto.

 



 

(i) Each Party recognizes and expressly acknowledges and agrees that any
failure by it or its Affiliates and Third Party Suppliers to perform the
Services to be provided by it as provided herein or other breach of this
Agreement by such Party may cause irreparable injury to the other Party for
which an adequate monetary remedy may not exist. Accordingly, each Party
agrees that the other Party may seek and obtain temporary injunctive and other
temporary equitable relief (including an order of specific performance), in
each case without necessity of posting a bond, restraining such breach or
threatened breach or compelling the cure thereof, and that such relief may be
sought, among other options, in the form of a temporary restraining order
obtained in an ex parte proceeding. The rights provided under this _Section
11(i)_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and
remedies available to a Party.

 



 

(j) No claim shall be brought or maintained by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties or their respective successors or
permitted assigns against any officer, director, employee (present or former)
or Affiliate of any Party which is not otherwise expressly identified as a
party hereto, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them,
by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of any Party set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto.

 



 

(k) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties may not avoid the limitations on
liability set forth in this _Section 11_ by seeking damages for breach of
contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability and the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties hereby waive such claims to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law.

 



 

12. _Dispute Resolution_. Prior to the initiation of any action, lawsuit, proceeding or other claim relating to this Agreement and subject to the obligations set forth in _Section 1(h)_ and _Section 4(b)_, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall first be referred to the Service Managers, who shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such dispute, controversy or claim. Any dispute, controversy or claim that is not resolved by the Service Managers shall be referred to the **[Executive Officer]** of Seller and the **[Executive Officer]** of Purchasers. In the event that any Party, after complying with the provisions set forth in this _Section 12_ desires to commence

       
 

 



 

an action, lawsuit, proceeding or other claim relating to this Agreement, such
Party, subject to _Section 14(p)_, may submit the dispute, controversy or
claim (or such series of related disputes, controversies or claims) to any
court of competent jurisdiction.

 



 

13. _Certain Contracts_.(1)

 



 

(a) _Certain Consents_. In the event that a Required Consent listed on
Schedule 2.2(f)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement has not been obtained prior to
the Closing, Seller, at Purchasers request in writing, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts with the reasonable assistance and cooperation
of Purchasers, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, to procure such
Required Consent promptly after the Closing Date. Seller will not be in breach

this _Section 13_.

 



 

(b) _Non-Transferring Contracts_. With effect from the Closing Date,

sums receivable by the Business for any work carried out under those Non-
Transferring Contracts prior to the Closing Date or for work carried out under
the Non-Transferring Contracts which has been invoiced as at the Closing Date
but is awaiting payment, in each case subject to and in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement); and

 



 

(ii) perform and complete all the obligations and, save as set out in the
Steps Memo, assume all of the liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates under
the Non-Transferring Contracts. Purchasers shall defend, indemnify and save
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties against and from all Losses which may
be imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against the Seller Indemnified
Parties by reason of Purchasers performance or non-performance of the Non-
Transferring Contracts or the assumption or non-assumption of the applicable
liabilities thereunder.

 



 

(c) _Seller s Obligations_. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, at Purchasers cost:

entered into) in order to include specific provisions for the Target Group to
receive the benefits from, and incur the liabilities of, the claims business
in Oman for a maximum period of time of 2 years from the Closing Date.
Likewise, to the extent that the transfer of the claims business of Hill

time of 1 year from the Closing Date.

      
 

 



 

(i) provide reasonable access to all relevant books, documents and other
information in relation to such Non-Transferring Contracts as Purchasers may
reasonably require from time to time; and

 



 

(ii) give all such information and reasonable assistance to Purchasers as
Purchasers may reasonably require to enable Purchasers and their Affiliates to
enforce their rights under such Non-Transferring Contracts or, if so required
by Purchasers, take such action as Purchasers may reasonably require to
enforce (on behalf of Purchasers) Sellers rights under such Non-Transferring
Contracts, and Seller shall hold any sums recovered as a result of such action
on trust for Purchasers and their successors, net of Sellers reasonable costs
of recovering such sums.

 



 

14. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Authorization_. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other
Party that: (i) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and perform its obligations hereunder; (ii) the execution, delivery and

agrees that the other Party shall not, and may refuse to, provide any
applicable Service to the extent that the provision of such Service would
require such Party, or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or
Affiliates or Third Party Suppliers, to violate any Applicable Laws or any of
such Partys policies and/or procedures (it being confirmed by each Party
that, as at the date of this Agreement, such Party is not aware of any such
Applicable Laws or policies and procedures that will be violated by the
provision of the Services to be provided by such Party). Each Party shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates, to follow the policies and procedures of
the other Party that are known to Purchasers such Party or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the Services provided to it by the other Party or
its Affiliates, including those in effect immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement and any changes thereto that are known to such Party or any of
its Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to, comply with all policies, procedures and
regulations of the other Party or its Affiliates relating to continuity of
business, computer and network security measures and data

      
 

 



 

encryption that are known to such Party or any of its Affiliates, including
any security requirements reasonably requested by the other Party of its
Affiliates. Each Party shall be responsible for its Affiliates, and its and
their Third Party Suppliers, subcontractors, consultants and agents

(c) _Parties in Interest_. Other than Persons entitled to receive
indemnification under _Section 1(d)(vii)_, _Section 3(f)_, or _Section 11_,

be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under Applicable Law, such

      
 

 



 

provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(k) _References_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and will not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and construed
as if no captions had been used in this Agreement. Unless the context
otherwise requires, any reference to a "Section" or "Schedule" shall be deemed
to refer to a section of this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement, as
applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. English shall be the governing
language of this Agreement. The word "including" shall mean "including,
without limitation."

 



 

(l) _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule
of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Consequently, in
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(m) _Force Majeure_. No Party shall be in default of its obligations hereunder
for any delays or failure in performance to the extent resulting from any
cause or circumstance beyond such Partys reasonable control as long as the
Party exercises commercially reasonable efforts to perform its obligations in
a timely manner.

 



 

(n) _Delivery by PDF_. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered into in
connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or
thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of an electronically
transmitted portable document format, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of either Party, the other Party shall re-
execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party. No
Party shall raise the use of electronic transmission in portable document
format to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or contract was
transmitted or communicated through the use of electronic transmission in
portable document format as a defense to the formation of a contract and each
Party forever waives any such defense.

 



 

(o) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one Party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

 



 

(p) _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules
or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. Each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding arising out of or

      
 

 



 

relating to this Agreement or any agreements or transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware and hereby expressly submits to the personal
jurisdiction and venue of such court for the purposes thereof and expressly
waives any claim of improper venue and any claim that such courts are an
inconvenient forum. Each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the service of
process of any of the aforementioned court in any such suit, action or
proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, to the address set forth or referred to in _Section 14(g)_.

 



 

(q) _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, REGARDLESS OF
WHICH PARTY INITIATES SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
