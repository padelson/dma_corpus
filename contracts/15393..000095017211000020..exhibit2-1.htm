WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, following the
consummation of the Offer, Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company
(the "Merger"), pursuant to which each outstanding Share shall be converted

Subsidiary of Parent;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board of
Directors") (i) has approved this Agreement, (ii) has determined that the
consideration to be paid for each Share in the Offer and the Merger is fair to
the holders of the Shares (the "Company Stockholders"), and (iii) has resolved
to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and tender their

Stockholders") adopt this Agreement, in each case, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS Parent, Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

  

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE OFFER AND MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Offer.

  

  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1 and none of the events or conditions set forth in Annex I
hereto shall have occurred and be continuing and not have been waived by
Parent or Purchaser, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof (and, in any event, no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the date of this Agreement), Parent shall cause Purchaser to, and Purchaser
shall, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares at
the Offer Price. The obligations of Purchaser to accept for payment and to pay
for any Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn on or prior to the
expiration of the Offer shall be subject only to (i) there being validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that
number of Class A Shares which represents a majority of the Class A Shares
outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of the expiration of the Offer (the
"Minimum Condition") and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto
(the "Offer Conditions"). Subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver (except
that the Minimum Condition may not be waived) by Parent or Purchaser of the
Minimum Condition and the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, in accordance
with the terms of the Offer, consummate the Offer and accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer promptly after expiration of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the twentieth (20th)
Business Day (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) following the commencement of the Offer; provided, however, that if on
the initial scheduled expiration date of the Offer or on any subsequent
scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as extended in accordance with this
Agreement) all conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or
waived, Purchaser may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, extend the
Offer for one or more periods of time of up to ten (10) Business Days each as
Purchaser may determine; and provided, further, that if on the initial
scheduled expiration date of the Offer or on any subsequent scheduled
expiration date of the Offer (as extended in accordance with this Agreement),
the condition to the Offer set forth in paragraph (f) of Annex I hereto has
not been satisfied, Purchaser shall be obligated to extend the Offer for one
or more periods of time of up to ten (10) Business Days each until such
condition has been satisfied. In no event shall Purchaser extend the Offer
following the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Purchaser may increase the Offer Price and extend the Offer to the extent
required by Law in connection with such increase, in each case in its sole
discretion and without the Company\'s consent. Purchaser and Parent shall not
amend or waive the Minimum Condition and shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, (A) decrease the Offer Price (as it may have been
increased hereunder) or change the form of consideration

  

  

 

2

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

payable in the Offer, (B) decrease the number of Shares sought pursuant to the
Offer, (C) add to the Offer Conditions or modify the Offer Conditions in a
manner adverse to the holders of Shares, (D) extend the Offer, except as
permitted or required by this Section 1.1 or as required by applicable Law
(including for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC" or
the staff thereof) or (E) make any other change in the terms or conditions of
the Offer that is adverse to the holders of Shares. The Offer may not be
terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended in accordance with this Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Article VIII. Following expiration of the Offer,
Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide a "subsequent offering period"
for three (3) to twenty (20) Business Days to acquire outstanding untendered
Shares in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. If Purchaser
shall commence a subsequent offering period in connection with the Offer,
Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn during such subsequent offering period. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, in accordance with
Article XI of the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation as in effect on the
date of this Agreement (the "Company Charter"), if Shares are accepted
pursuant to the Offer, Parent and Purchaser for two (2) years thereafter shall
take such actions as are necessary to offer to purchase, for cash, any Shares
not tendered, at the Offer Price, it being understood and agreed that upon
consummation of the Merger any such Shares not tendered will no longer remain
outstanding and Parent and Purchaser shall be deemed to have satisfied their
obligations under this sentence.

 

  

  

(c) On the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and Purchaser shall file with
the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer,
which shall include the offer to purchase and form of the letter of
transmittal (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Offer Documents"). Subject to the Company\'s compliance with
Section 1.2(b) and Section 1.3(b), Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as required by applicable
U.S. federal securities Laws. Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. Purchaser
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares as
required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the
Company that is required or reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser in
connection with the obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in
this Section 1.1(b) and as required by Law. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments or communications that Parent,
Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after Parent\'s or
Purchaser\'s, as the case may be, receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses thereto, and shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Purchaser
to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration

  

  

 

3

  

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

shall be given), including by participating with Parent and Purchaser or their
counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

  

  

(d) Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser all of the funds necessary
to purchase any and all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Purchaser\'s obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(e) The Offer Price shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Shares), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect
to Shares occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the payment by Purchaser for the Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn in connection with the Offer; provided,
however, that no adjustment to the Offer Price shall be made with respect to
the Permitted Dividend.

  

  

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, and represents
and warrants that the Company Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and
held, has unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, and deemed this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders; (ii) approved and
adopted this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the
Merger, in all respects, and, subject to the accuracy of the representation

purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL; (iii) subject to Section 6.3(c), resolved
to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer, that the Company
Stockholders tender their Shares in the Offer, and that the Class A

(the "Company Board Recommendation") and (iv) for purposes of Article IV,
Sections 1A.6, 1A.8 and 1A.15 of the Company Charter, consented to the
transfer of Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company consents to the
inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents, subject
to Section 6.3(c).

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following (but on the same date as) the
filing of the Offer Documents, the Company shall, in a manner that complies
with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 6.3(c) and the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board of Directors, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and,
subject to Purchaser\'s compliance with Section 1.1(a), disseminated to
holders of Shares as required by and in accordance with applicable U.S.
federal securities Laws. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. The
Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of

  

  

4

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

the Shares as required by and in accordance with applicable U.S. federal
securities Laws. Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that is required or reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the obligations relating to the
Schedule 14D-9 contained in this Section 1.2(b). Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the Company agrees to provide
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel in writing with any comments or
communications that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the Company\'s receipt of such comments, and any oral or written responses
thereto and shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of the Company to those comments
and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith
consideration shall be given), including by participating with the Company or
its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

 

  

  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and
any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of
the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall promptly
furnish Purchaser with such information and assistance (including, but not
limited to, lists of holders of the Shares, updated periodically, and their
addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions) as Purchaser or its
agents may reasonably request. Except as required by applicable Law, and
except as necessary to communicate regarding the Offer, the Merger or the
Transactions with the Company Stockholders, Parent and Purchaser (and their
respective Representatives) shall hold in confidence the information contained
in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions, and, if this
Agreement is terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all copies of such
information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in the
possession of their Representatives.

  

  

(d) The Company hereby: (i) waives all rights to repurchase any Shares
purchased by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or the terms of this Agreement,
whether arising pursuant to Article IV Section 1A.5 or 9 of the Company
Charter or otherwise, (ii) consents to the future transfer of such Shares, and
waives any right to purchase such Shares upon any subsequent transfer, whether
arising pursuant to Article IV Section 1A.5, 6 or 8 of the Company Charter or
otherwise, provided such transfer does not delay the consummation of the
Merger, and (iii) represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that the Class A
Shares purchased pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be entitled to
the same voting and consent rights as Class A Shares that remain outstanding
following consummation of the Offer and held by persons other than Purchaser.

  

  

(e) If at any time following the Acceptance Time, the number of holders of
record of the Class A Shares is fewer than three hundred (300), the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to terminate registration of the Class A
Shares under the Exchange Act, including the filing of Exchange Act Form 15
with the SEC.

Section 1.3 Directors.

  

  

(a) Promptly following the acceptance for payment by Purchaser of Shares
pursuant to and in accordance with the Offer (the "Acceptance Time"), and for
so long as Parent directly or indirectly beneficially owns not less than a
majority of the then issued and outstanding Class A Shares, the Company shall
reduce the total number of directors on the Company Board of Directors to five
and Purchaser shall be entitled to designate three directors on the Company
Board of Directors. The Company shall also, upon the request of Parent, cause
such persons designated by Purchaser to constitute a majority of each
committee of the Company Board of Directors (other than any committee
comprised solely of Continuing Directors established to take action under this
Agreement, which shall be permitted to meet without the presence of other
directors solely for purposes of considering and, if necessary, taking action
referred to in Section 1.3(c) below). At the next regular meeting of the
Company Board of Directors after the date of this Agreement, which is
scheduled for Thursday, September 8, 2011 and which will not be adjourned to a
date later than the Business Day prior to the initial expiration date of the
Offer, the Company will amend the By-laws of the Company and take such other
action as is necessary or appropriate to permit representatives of Parent and
Purchaser to serve as directors on the Company Board of Directors and each
committee thereof from and after the Acceptance Time and for no other Person
to be required to be elected or designated to the Company Board of Directors
or any committee thereof other than the Continuing Directors. Solely for the
purposes of this Section 1.3, any and all members of the Company Board of
Directors immediately prior to such appointments by Parent who remain on the
Company Board after such appointment by Parent shall be referred to as
"Continuing Directors"; which Continuing Directors are hereby and shall be
deemed to be constituted as a committee of the Company Board of Directors for
purposes of the actions to be taken thereby pursuant to Section 1.3(c). Except
with respect to the Continuing Directors, the Company will cause the
resignations of each director on the Company Board of Directors (and each
committee thereof), which resignations are each contingent solely upon the
occurrence of the Acceptance Time and the Company's acceptance of such
resignation. Upon the consummation of the Offer, the Company shall accept such
resignations. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at
least two Continuing Directors. If the number of directors who are Continuing
Directors is reduced below two prior to the Effective Time, the remaining
Continuing Director shall be entitled to designate an individual to fill such
vacancy who is not a current or former officer, director, employee or
consultant of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Parent Insider") and who
shall be deemed a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, and
the Company shall cause such designee to be appointed to the Company Board of
Directors. If, notwithstanding compliance with the foregoing provisions, the
number of Continuing Directors is reduced to zero, then the other directors on
the Company Board of Directors shall designate and appoint to the Company
Board of Directors two individuals who are not Parent Insiders who shall be
deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

 

  

(b) The Company's obligations to appoint designees of Purchaser to the Company
Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. The Company, at its expense, shall promptly
take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to the
Company Stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9,

  

  

6

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

as contemplated by Section 1.2(b)) as is necessary to fulfill the Company's
obligations under Section 1.3(a); provided, that Parent and Purchaser shall
have timely supplied to the Company in writing, and shall be solely
responsible for, any information with respect to Parent, Purchaser and their
designees, officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required by such
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The
provisions of Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights
Parent, Purchaser or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or
beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of Law with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise.  

 

  

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Purchaser's designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by a majority of
the Continuing Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one or two
Continuing Directors then in office, all of such Continuing Directors then in
office) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall (A) not
be effective unless there is in office at least one (1) Continuing Director
and (B) constitute the authorization of the Company Board of Directors, and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any committee
thereof or any other director of the Company, shall, unless otherwise required
by Law, be required or permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment, modification
or termination of this Agreement, or agreement or consent to any amendment,
modification or termination of this Agreement, by the Company, (ii) any
extension of time for performance, or waiver, of any obligation or action
hereunder by Parent or Purchaser, (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the
Company's rights under this Agreement if such action would adversely affect
the interests of the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent or any of
its affiliates), (iv) any waiver of any condition to the Company's obligations
hereunder, (v) any material amendment or other modification to the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the interests of the Company Stockholders (other
than Parent or any of its affiliates), or (vi) the taking of any other action
by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, other
than the Company's performance of its obligations under this Agreement
(including the consummation of the Merger), that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the interests of the stockholders of the Company (other
than Parent or any of its affiliates). The Continuing Directors shall have the
authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the
Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on
behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the
Company's rights hereunder, in each case to the extent reasonably appropriate
to the exercise and discharge of their fiduciary and other duties.

accordance with applicable Law:

  

  

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of the Class

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy or information

and regulations promulgated thereunder. Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
Law. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy
Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to

further comments on the Proxy Statement, including the first date following
the tenth calendar day following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement
if the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the Proxy
Statement (the "Proxy Statement Clearance Date") to (and Parent and Purchaser
shall have the right, at any time after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date, to
request in writing that the Company, and upon receipt of such written request,
the Company shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days), (x) establish a record date for and give notice of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the mailing of the Proxy Statement if no Company
Stockholders Meeting is required and (y) mail to the holders of Company Common
Stock as of the record date established the Proxy Statement (the date the
Company elects to take such action or is required to take such action, the
"Proxy Date"). Unless the Company has received sufficient written consents to
obviate the need for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall duly
call, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; provided, however, that in no
event shall such meeting be held later than 35 calendar days following the
date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company's stockholders and any
adjournments of such meetings shall require the prior written consent of
Parent other than in the case it is required to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the SEC or its staff has instructed the Company is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date, the
Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date
without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by
applicable Law or the Company's bylaws. Unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company shall submit this
Agreement to the Class A Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting even
if the Company Board of Directors shall have effected a Recommendation
Withdrawal or proposed or announced any intention to do so. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions
(including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural
matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Class A
Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

  

  

 

(b) Subject to Section 6.3(c), the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from the Class A Stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and take all actions reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the approval of the

  

 

  

10

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

Class A Stockholders required by the DGCL, the Company Charter and any other
applicable Law to effect the Merger.

  

  

(c) Parent and Purchaser shall supply all information reasonably requested by
the Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement as
promptly as practicable.

  

  

(d) Subject to Section 6.3(c), the Company shall, through the Company Board of
Directors, recommend to the Class A Stockholders adoption of this Agreement,
and, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, shall not withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board
Recommendation. Parent agrees that it will vote, or cause to be voted, or
submit a written consent with respect to, all of the Class A Shares then owned
by it, Purchaser or any of Parent\'s other Subsidiaries in favor of the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger.

  

  

Section 1.10 Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. Notwithstanding Section
1.9, in the event that Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent
shall acquire at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Class A Shares,
Parent and Purchaser agree to take all necessary and appropriate actions to
cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of the Class A Stockholders, in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

  

Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Shares
or the holders of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
(the "Purchaser Common Stock"):

  

  

 

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares
owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

  

(c) Each outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), subject to any required
withholding of Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest thereon.

  

 

  

11

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders
of Shares in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive the
funds to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(c). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section
2.1(c). For purposes of determining the amount of Merger Consideration to be
so deposited, Parent and Purchaser shall assume that no Company Stockholder
will perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates") and to each holder of
record that immediately prior to the Effective Time held their Shares in book-
entry form ("Book-Entry Shares"), whose Shares were converted pursuant to
Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and
which shall be in customary form and shall include customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book Entry Share and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
the case may be, so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is registered, it
shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, as the case may be, so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (y) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Book Entry Share shall
be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash, without interest thereon and subject to any
required withholding of Taxes.

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing ownership of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are

  

  

12

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

  

  

(d) At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for Merger Consideration that is delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

  

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable federal, state, local
or foreign Tax Law; provided that, if the Company delivers to Parent a timely
and properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser
that satisfies Purchaser\'s obligations under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3), neither the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent
shall deduct or withhold from such consideration any amounts under Section
1445 of the Code. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

  

Section 2.3 Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or such holder waives,
withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to appraisal. A holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Shares held by such holder in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or such holder
waives, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\'s right to appraisal, in

  

  

13

  

  

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

which case such Shares shall be converted into and represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Certificate or Certificates or Book Entry Shares representing such Shares
pursuant to Section 2.2 and such Shares shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

Except as set forth in (i) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") (which Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth items of
disclosure with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which the information in the Company Disclosure Schedule
relates; provided, however, that any information set forth in one Section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each
other Section or subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is
readily apparent on its face) or (ii) except with respect to Sections 3.3,
3.4, 3.5, 3.11(a) and 3.17(a), the Company SEC Documents filed after December
31, 2010 and prior to the date of this Agreement (only to the extent such
relevance is readily apparent on its face and other than risk factors (except
for any disclosure that relates to historical facts)), the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

  

  

Section 3.1 Corporate Organization and Power.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary (i) is an entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and (ii) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary is qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature
of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary and the failure to so qualify would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent and Purchaser true and complete copies of the Company
Charter, the By-laws of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement
(as so amended, the "Company By-laws"), and the comparable charter and
organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, in each case as amended
to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

14

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

(b) As used in this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any
effect, change, development, event or circumstance that, considered together
with all other effects, changes, developments, events or circumstances, is or
would reasonably be expected to be or to become materially adverse to, or has
or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on, (i) the
business, results of operations, liabilities or financial condition of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of
the Company to consummate the Transactions or to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that, in the case of
clause (i) only, none of the following shall be deemed to be, and shall not be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Company Material
Adverse Effect: facts, circumstances, developments, events, changes, effects
or occurrences (A) generally affecting the economy or the financial, debt,
credit or securities markets in the United States, (B) generally affecting the
industry in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary operates, (C)
resulting from (x) the taking of any action (1) contemplated by Section 6.6 of
this Agreement required to obtain any approval or authorization under
applicable Antitrust Law for the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
(2) otherwise explicitly required under this Agreement or consented to by
Parent or Purchaser, or (y) any action taken by a customer of the Company that
is a provider of on-line legal information services as a result of the
announcement or pendency of this Agreement, (D) resulting from changes in Law,
GAAP or accounting standards or authoritative interpretations thereof, or (E)
resulting from acts of war or terrorism occurring after the date of this
Agreement, except, in the case of clauses (A), (B), (D) and (E), to the extent
such change, effect, event or occurrence has a materially disproportionate
effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared
with other companies operating in the industries in which the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries operate.

  

  

Section 3.2 Company Subsidiaries; Equity Interests.

  

  

(a) All the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of
each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by the Company free and clear of all pledges,
liens, charges, mortgages, options, claims, security interests, or other
encumbrances and restrictions of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively,
"Encumbrances") except for Permitted Liens. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Subsidiary" means with respect to any party, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other organization or entity,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i) at least a majority of
the securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such organization is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by such
party and one or more of its Subsidiaries or (ii) such party or any other
Subsidiary of such party is a general partner (excluding any such partnership
where such party or any Subsidiary of such party does not have a majority of
the voting interest in such partnership), and the term "Company Subsidiary"
means the Subsidiaries of the Company set forth in Section 3.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not
own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,
partnership interest, joint venture

  

  

15

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

interest or other equity interest in any Person other than investments in
marketable securities constituting less than 5% of a class of outstanding
securities of such Person.

 

  

  

Section 3.3 Capitalization

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 30,000,000
Class A Shares; (ii) 30,000,000 Class B Shares; and (iii) 5,000,000 Class C
Shares. As of the date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time, (i)
9,597,017 Class A Shares, (ii) 15,513,363 Class B Shares and 6,450 Class C
Shares are issued and outstanding, except in the case of the Acceptance Time,
additional Class B Shares or Class C Shares issued in exchange for an equal
number of previously outstanding Class A Shares which are no longer issued or
outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Except as disclosed in Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are no existing options, warrants,
calls, pre-emptive rights, subscriptions or other rights, restricted stock
awards, restricted stock unit awards, agreements, arrangements, understandings
or commitments of any kind obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
issue, transfer, register or sell or cause to be issued, transferred,
registered or sold any shares of capital stock or other equity interest in,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such shares or equity interests or other securities, or
obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter
into any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other right, restricted
stock award, restricted stock unit award, agreement, arrangement,
understanding or commitment, (ii) there are no restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights, in each case, that were issued by the
Company and that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based,
directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or voting
securities of the Company and (iii) there are no outstanding agreements,
arrangements, understandings or commitments of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Shares or the
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

  

(b) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
the Company having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders of
the Company may vote.

  

  

(c) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.3(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company has not, between January 1, 2011 and the date of this Agreement,
declared or paid any dividend, or declared or made any distribution on,
authorized or effected any split-up or any other recapitalization of, any of
its capital stock, or directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise
acquired any of its outstanding capital stock (other than the declaration and
payment of regular semi-annual cash dividends by the Company to its
stockholders prior to the date of this Agreement).

  

  

Section 3.4 Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.

  

  

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions provided for or contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer and the Merger

  

  

16

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

(collectively, the "Transactions"), subject, in the case of the Merger, to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval if required by Law. The execution
and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it of
the Transactions to be performed or consummated by the Company have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval if required by Law. The Company has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to creditors\'
rights generally and to general principles of equity.  

 

  

(b) The Company Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has
unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, and deemed this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the Transactions advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, in all
respects, (iii) subject to Section 6.3, resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer, that the Company Stockholders tender their
Shares in the Offer, and that the Class A Stockholders adopt this Agreement to
the extent required by applicable Law, and (iv) for purposes of Article IV,
Sections 1A.6, 1A.8 and 1A.15 of the Company Charter, consented to the
transfer of Shares pursuant to the Offer, and none of the aforesaid actions by
the Company Board of Directors has been amended, rescinded or modified as of
the date of this Agreement. Subject to the accuracy of the representation set
forth in the second sentence of Section 4.2(b), the action taken by the
Company Board of Directors is sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent and
Purchaser and this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
and constitutes approval thereof for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL and
represents the only action necessary to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL
does not and will not apply to the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, including the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions. To the Company\'s Knowledge, no other state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to the Transactions
(including each of the Offer and the Merger).

  

  

(c) Subject to Section 1.9 of this Agreement and subject to the accuracy of
the representation set forth in the second sentence of Section 4.2(b), the
only vote of holders of any class or series of Company capital stock necessary
to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class A Shares (the
"Company Stockholder Approval").

  

  

Section 3.5 No Conflicts; Consents.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company, the consummation by the Company of the Transactions or compliance by
the Company with any provisions of this Agreement will conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without the lapse of time or
the giving of notice, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit under,

  

  

17

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights (including any
right to acquire any of the Company Real Property) or entitlements of any
Person under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries under, any
provision of (i) the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable
charter or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) any
contract, lease, license, indenture, note, bond, mortgage, lien, agreement,
arrangement, permit, concession, franchise or understanding or other
instrument (each, a "Contract") to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound
or (iii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section
3.5(b), any judgment, order or decree ("Judgment") or statute, law (including
common law), ordinance, rule or regulation ("Law") applicable to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  

  

(b) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization ("Consent")
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit from, any Federal,
state, local or foreign government or any court of competent jurisdiction,
arbitral tribunal, administrative agency or commission or other governmental
authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"),
is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, other than (i) any
filings as may be required under the DGCL and appropriate documents with the
relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which the Company is
qualified to do business, (ii) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Schedule
14D-9 (B) the Proxy Statement if the Company Stockholder Approval is required
by Law and (C) such other reports under, or other applicable requirements of,
the Exchange Act, as may be required in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions, (iii) compliance with and filings under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), (iv) any additional Consents and filings under any foreign antitrust,
competition, premerger notification or trade regulation law, regulation or
order ("Antitrust Laws"), and (v) such other items that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.6 SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1,
2008 pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  

  

(b) As of its respective date or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each report, form,
schedule or definitive proxy statement filed or furnished since January 1,
2008 by the Company with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the
Exchange Act (the "Company SEC Documents") complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act applicable to such
Company SEC Document. Except to the extent that information contained in any
Company SEC Document has been revised or superseded, including with updated
information, by a later Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue

  

  

18

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

  

  

(c) As of the dates on which they were filed or amended in Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the audited financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included
in such Company SEC Documents (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) (i) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and (iii) fairly presented, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of

case (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any
liability or has any present or future obligation to contribute or make

and contract referred to in (i), (ii) and (iii) is referred to as a "Company
Plan").

  

  

(b) True and complete copies of each of the following documents have been
delivered or made available by the Company to Parent with respect to each
Company Plan (excluding each Company Plan that is a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a "Company Multiemployer

(c) Except as specifically set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule: (i) each Company Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion
letter from the IRS that it is so qualified and nothing has occurred since the
date of such letter that could reasonably be expected to affect the qualified
status of such Company Plan; (ii) each Company Plan has been maintained,
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and the requirements of applicable Law (including ERISA, the Code, and
all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder); (iii) neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any direct or indirect liability under,
arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA in connection with the
termination of, or withdrawal from, any Company Plan or other retirement plan
or arrangement, and no fact or event exists that would reasonably be expected
to give rise to any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for the
payment of insurance premiums, all of which have been timely paid); (iv) there
are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims by or on
behalf of or relating to any of the Company Plans, by any employee or

collective bargaining agreement have been timely made in full. No amount has
been paid by the Company or any Company Subsidiary which would be subject to
the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code such that all or a part of such

Multiemployer Plan, the amount set forth on Section 3.11(d) of the Company

Company Subsidiary to severance pay or any other payment or accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of compensation or
benefits due any such current or former employee or director; or (ii) limit or
restrict the right of the Company to merge, amend or terminate any of the
Company Plans. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is party to an
agreement or arrangement that

  

  

23

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

could give rise to a payment that is nondeductible under Section 280G of the
Code by reason of the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken any action or
failed to take any action which would result in the imposition of a material
excise tax on the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to Sections 4975
or 4980B of the Code or other material liability pursuant to Section 502(i) of
ERISA.

of the Transactions (whether alone or together with any other event) shall not
affect, the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all Company Plans
providing for retiree health or life insurance coverage or other retiree death
benefits, and there have been no communications to current or former employees
or directors which could reasonably be interpreted to promise or guarantee
such employees or directors retiree health or life insurance or other retiree
death benefits on a permanent basis.

  

  

(h) The Company represents and warrants that it intends that certain payments
that have been made or are to be made and certain benefits that have been
granted or are to be granted according to employment compensation, severance
and other employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Plans
(collectively, the "Arrangements"), to certain holders of Shares (the "Covered
Securityholders") and all such amounts payable under the Arrangements (i) are
being paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future
services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing,
by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) are
not calculated based on the number of Shares tendered or to be tendered into
the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. The Company also
represents and warrants that (i) the adoption, approval, amendment or
modification of each Arrangement since the discussions relating to the
Transactions between the Company and Parent began has been approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the execution
of this Agreement of all necessary actions by the Company Board of Directors,
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors or its
independent directors.

Effect. There are no Judgments outstanding (or, to the Knowledge of the

Subsidiary or applicable to their business or assets, except for Judgments
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Company SEC Documents filed

Company Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses, authorizations, franchises
and approvals of all Governmental Entities (collectively, "Permits"),
necessary or advisable for them to own, lease or operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses as now conducted, except for such

arising out of a collective bargaining agreement is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, except for any such grievances or proceedings that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company

and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Parent
and the Company shall give prompt notice to the other party of the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event

  

  

38

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of a party to effect the Offer, the
Merger or the Transactions not to be satisfied. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other hand, shall give prompt written notice to the other
party of (i) any notice or other communication from any third party alleging
that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any Company Material Adverse
Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 6.2 Access; Confidentiality. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated
May 11, 2011, entered into between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), the Company shall afford to the Representatives
(as hereinafter defined) of Parent and Purchaser, reasonable access, during
normal business hours to the Company\'s properties, books, records and
personnel and all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to provide Parent access to any
information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, (i) breach any agreement of the Company with any third-party, (ii)
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the
Company, (iii) result in a competitor of the Company receiving material
information that is competitively sensitive, the sharing of which could
constitute a violation of any applicable Law, or (iv) otherwise violate any
applicable Law. Insofar, however, as Parent's outside counsel, in contrast to
the Parent, may reasonably be granted access to any such otherwise restricted
materials, if pursuant to a common-interest agreement, the Company shall
provide Parent's outside counsel with such access as may be reasonable. Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and Purchaser will hold any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 6.2 in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Representatives" shall mean, with respect to any Person (or its
Subsidiaries), its respective officers, directors, employees, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers or other agents. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in
such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or otherwise result in any significant interference
with the prompt and timely discharge by the Company\'s employees of their
normal duties. No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall affect any
representation or warranty made by the parties hereunder.

Section 6.3 Non-Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.3(b), from and after the date of this Agreement and
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article VIII, none of the Company or the Company\'s
Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, or
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing
non-public information or data) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or
offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect
thereto or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly assist or
participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations, or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement providing for or relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Subject to Section 6.3(b), the
Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation,
encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons (other than Parent)
conducted theretofore by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any
Representatives with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company
agrees not to waive, or otherwise release any Person from, the confidentiality
and standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company is or may
become a party.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, in the event that the Company receives an
unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal after the date
hereof that did not result from the Company\'s material breach of any
provision of this Section 6.3 and that does not constitute a breach of any
standstill agreement with the Company, the Company and the Company Board of
Directors may participate in discussions or negotiations (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or furnish any information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, any Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of
financing if (i) the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisor, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
participate in such discussions or negotiations or to furnish such information
would be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law; provided, that the Company will not, and
will use reasonable best efforts not to allow Company Representatives to,
disclose any non-public information to such Person without entering into a
confidentiality agreement on terms, with respect to the maintenance of
confidentiality of the Company\'s information, which are consistent with, and
are no less favorable to the Company in any material respect than, the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) notify Parent in the event it receives (i) a Company Acquisition
Proposal or written indication by any Person that it is considering

  

  

40

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

making a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries other than
requests for information in the ordinary course of business unrelated to a
Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions
or negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall include
in such notice the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry, and
the material terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition Proposal,
written indication, request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably apprised as to the status and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations concerning the same and provide to Parent
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all correspondence sent to or received by the Company and all
information provided by the Company to any Person pursuant to such Company
Acquisition Proposal, written indication, request or inquiry. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) notify Parent
orally and in writing if it determines to provide non-public information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to this Section 6.3(b). The Company shall provide Parent and
Purchaser with any non-public information provided to a third party that was
not previously provided to Parent and Purchaser within 24 hours of such non-
public information being provided to a third-party. The Company shall not, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that
prohibits the Company from providing information to Parent that it is required
to provide pursuant to this Section 6.3.

  

  

(c) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)
directly or indirectly withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in
a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, or publicly propose to do so, (ii) if
a Company Acquisition Proposal (including a tender offer or exchange offer for
shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes a Company Acquisition
Proposal) is commenced or publicly disclosed, fail to (A) publicly recommend
against such tender offer, exchange offer or other Company Acquisition
Proposal (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to
the acceptance of any such tender offer or exchange offer by the stockholders
of the Company, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer) within ten (10) Business
Days of the date on which such Company Acquisition Proposal is first commenced
or publicly disclosed and (B) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within
such ten (10) Business Day period, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to include
the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or fail to permit
Parent and Purchaser to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer
Documents, (v) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, the
approval by the compensation committee of the Company of any of the
compensation arrangements for purposes of satisfying the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe-harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act or (vi) resolve to do any of the foregoing (any of the actions described
in clauses (i) through (vi) of this Section 6.3(c), a "Recommendation
Withdrawal"). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in response to a Superior Proposal or
an Intervening Event, the Company Board of Directors may make a Recommendation
Withdrawal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), only if
(i) the Company has provided a written notice (a "Notice of Recommendation
Withdrawal") to Parent and Purchaser that (A) states that the Company intends
to take such action and sets forth the manner and timing in which it intends
to do so and (B) either (x) in the case of a Superior Proposal

  

  

41

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

includes the material terms of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such
action (including the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal), or
(y) in the case of an Intervening Event, includes a description of the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail sufficient to enable Purchaser to
reasonably determine the effect of the Intervening Event on the value of the
Company, (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period following Parent's and
Purchaser's receipt of the Notice of Recommendation Withdrawal, the Company
shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and
Purchaser in good faith (to the extent Parent and Purchaser desire to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company Board of Directors to proceed with the
Company Board Recommendation, and (iii) following the end of such three (3)
Business Day period, the Company Board of Directors shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and Purchaser that both (A) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Recommendation Withdrawal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (B)
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Any material amendment to the financial terms or
any other material amendment of a Superior Proposal or material change in the
Intervening Event that is the basis of Notice of Recommendation Withdrawal
shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Withdrawal and the Company shall
be required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 6.3(c).  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent required by federal securities Laws or
(ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders or taking any position
with respect to the Merger if, in the case of this clause (ii), in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors, after consultation with its
outside counsel, failure to so take and/or disclose likely would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or required to
comply with obligations under federal securities Laws; provided, any such
disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) (other than a "stop, look and
listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Recommendation
Withdrawal unless the Company Board of Directors expressly reaffirms in such
disclosure the Company Board Recommendation; provided, however, that this
clause (d) shall not permit the Company to take any action restricted by
Section 6.3(a) or (b) or to make a Recommendation Withdrawal except to the
extent expressly permitted by Section 6.3(a), (b) or (c).

  

 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company from
responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the
Person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 6.3.

  

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, the term:

  

  

(i) "Company Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person other than Parent, Purchaser or any affiliate thereof relating to
(i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase (whether in a single
transaction or a series of transactions) of a business or businesses that

  

  

42

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

constitutes 20% or more of the cash flow, net revenues, net income or assets
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more
of any class or series of Company securities, (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class or series of Company securities, (iii) any
merger, reorganization, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company (or any Company Subsidiary or
Company Subsidiaries whose business or businesses constitute(s) 20% or more of
the cash flow, net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or any other transaction similar to
any of the foregoing with respect to the Company, in each case other than any
Transaction to be effected pursuant to this Agreement; and  

  

(ii) "Intervening Event" means any event, development or circumstance (other
than any event, development or circumstance relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal) that both (x) occurs, or first becomes known to the Company Board of
Directors, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time, and (y) that the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, makes it appropriate to consider a Recommendation
Withdrawal.

  

  

(iii) "Superior Proposal" means a written, bona fide unsolicited Company
Acquisition Proposal (except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced
by "50%"), the terms of which the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and considering such factors as the Company Board of
Directors considers to be appropriate (including the conditionality, certainty
of financing and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal on
the terms proposed), is more favorable to the Company Stockholders than the
Offer; provided, that no Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Superior Proposal if any financing required to consummate such Company
Acquisition Proposal is not committed.

 

  

  

Section 6.4 Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the execution
of this Agreement shall be a joint press release acceptable to Parent and the
Company. Thereafter, except with respect to any Recommendation Withdrawal or
any actions taken by the Company or the Company Board of Directors pursuant
to, and in accordance with, Section 6.3, so long as this Agreement is in
effect, the Company and Parent shall use reasonable efforts to consult with
each other before issuing any press release or other public announcement
primarily relating to the Transactions or this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.5 Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance and Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,

  

  

43

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company than are set forth in the
Company Charter and Company By-laws as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights of individuals who were directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company at or prior to the Effective Time, unless such
modification shall be required by Law.  

  

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Company\'s
existing officers\' and directors\' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent may
substitute therefor policies of substantially equivalent coverage and amounts
containing terms no less favorable to such former directors, officers or
fiduciaries; provided that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that any substitution or
replacement of existing policies shall not result in any gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; provided, further, that if any of the existing
DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such period, then
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain substantially similar DandO
Insurance; and provided, further, however, that in no event shall Parent or
the Surviving Corporation be required to pay annual premiums for insurance
under this Section 6.5(b) in excess of 250% of the current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance.

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any individual who is now, or who has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.5
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

  

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 6.5 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the indemnified parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an indemnified party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Parent shall pay all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by the persons
referred to in this Section 6.5 in connection with their successful
enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.5.

  

  

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

  

  

44

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

Section 6.6 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to use its respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as practicable including, but not limited to, using their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents,
authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any third Person or
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Offer and the Merger and (iii) not take any action that
would be reasonably likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the
Transactions. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper
officers and directors of each party hereto shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take all such action. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the Transactions as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use its reasonable best
efforts to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable, including requesting early termination of the HSR Act
waiting period. In addition, each party hereto agrees that it shall not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party.

  

  

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall, without limitation, except
communications solely for the purpose of scheduling or other logistical
matters: (i) promptly notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the
other with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other
of) any communications from or with any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Transactions; (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
written or any oral communication with any such Governmental Entity; (iii) not
participate in any meeting or have any communication with any such
Governmental Entity unless it has given the other an opportunity to consult
with it in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate therein; and
(iv) furnish the other party with copies of all filings and communications
between it (or its Representatives) and any such Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights of the Company and Parent
under this Section 6.6(b) may be exercised on their behalf by their respective
outside counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall not be obligated to disclose to the
Company confidential information of Parent or Parent\'s ultimate parent entity
or Parent\'s merger notification filings, including the Notification and
Report Form submitted pursuant to the HSR Act or communications with respect
to confidential information contained therein.

  

  

45

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use all reasonable
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any action, including administrative
or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, Judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the Transactions, including by vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

  

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.6, if any objections are asserted with respect to
the Transactions under any Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the U.S.
Department of Justice ("DOJ") or any other applicable Governmental Entity or
any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, each of Parent and
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
Transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further action as
may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ,
state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any
other nation or other jurisdiction may assert under any Law with respect to
the Offer or the Merger, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the Offer or the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take any and all
action necessary, including but not limited to (w) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, (x) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, (y) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries, or (z) effectuating any other change or
restructuring of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries or otherwise taking or committing to take any actions
that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its
Subsidiaries\' or affiliates\' (including the Surviving Corporation\'s)
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its or its Subsidiaries\' or affiliates\' (including the Surviving
Corporation\'s) businesses, product lines or assets (and in each case, a
"Divestiture Action"), to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order,
or establishes any Law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger or to ensure that no Governmental Entity with the authority to clear,
authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger fails to do so
by the Outside Date; provided, however, that (i) following the date hereof,
Parent shall have the sole and exclusive right to propose, negotiate, offer to
commit and effect, any Divestiture Action and shall provide the Company with
prompt notice of any such proposals, negotiations or offers and the material
terms thereof; (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall
promptly apprise the Company of communications regarding any Divestiture
Action, except communications solely related to scheduling or logistical
matters; (iii) Parent\'s obligation to undertake a Divestiture Action shall
not apply to any asset or business of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates
other than

  

  

46

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

the legal-publication assets and businesses of the foregoing; and (iv) Parent,
Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates
shall not become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement
or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, to hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change their
respective assets or businesses, unless such requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order is binding only in the event that the
Closing occurs. If any Divestiture Action requires action by or with respect
to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or its businesses or assets, and
such action would constitute a breach of Section 5.1, Parent hereby agrees to
consent to the taking of such action by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be
conditioned upon consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

Section 6.7 Approval of Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the expiration of
the Offer (as such date may be extended in accordance with this Agreement),
each of Parent and the Company shall take all actions necessary so that any
Arrangements that have been or will be entered into after the date of the
Agreement by the Company or its Subsidiaries with Covered Securityholders will
be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and to ensure that the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule
14d-10(d) is otherwise applicable thereto.

  

  

Section 6.8 Employee Benefits Matters. For purposes of this Section 6.8, the
term "Company Employee" shall mean each individual who is employed by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the Effective Time.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in an individual employment agreement or any
collective bargaining agreement, for a period of two (2) years following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide compensation
(including salary, cash bonus, commissions, and other incentives, but not
including equity incentives) and benefits to Company Employees that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the levels of such compensation and
benefits provided to such Company Employees by the Company immediately before
the Effective Time, provided, however, that such compensation and benefits
provided by the Company immediately before the Effective Time shall be
determined exclusive of any right to purchase Shares or equity incentive
awards or cash bonuses awarded under the Company's profit-sharing plan.

  

  

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall credit
each non-union Company Employee for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual for all of the Company Employee's service with the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries and their respective predecessor entities, if any,
under any and all employee compensation and incentive plans, and under any and
all benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (including vacation and
leave of absence policies), maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as
of and after the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates
(each, a "Surviving Corporation Plan") to the extent such service was
recognized for such purpose by the Company Plan (but not for purposes of
benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or long-term incentive
plan or to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits). With respect to each Surviving Corporation Plan that is a "welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Surviving Corporation
shall: (i) cause there to be waived

  

  

47

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations except to the extent
such limitations as to preexisting conditions eligibility were applicable to a
Company Employee under a Company Plan that is a welfare benefit plan and (ii)
give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed or
reimbursable to, Company Employees under similar Company Plans for the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall permit each Company Employee who
satisfied the eligibility requirements of the Company's 401(k) plan to
participate in the 401(k) plan of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) Without limiting and in any event notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section 6.8, upon the termination of employment from Parent or its
Subsidiaries (or their successors) of a Company Employee: (i) who is not
employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and (ii) who would have
been entitled to post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits under the
programs of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as in effect as of the
date hereof if the employment of such individual with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries terminated as of the date hereof (such Company Employee,
a "Currently Eligible Retiree") or within eighteen months of the date hereof
(such Company Employee, a "Future Eligible Retiree"), the Surviving
Corporation shall provide to each Currently Eligible Retiree and Future
Eligible Retiree, upon their respective termination of employment with Parent
and its Subsidiaries (or their successors), post-retirement medical and life
insurance benefits substantially identical to those provided from time to time
to otherwise similarly situated retirees receiving such benefits under the
programs of the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the date hereof
(treating service after the Closing with Parent or its Subsidiaries (or their
successors) as service with the Company); provided, that the foregoing shall
not prohibit the amendment or termination of such benefits if such benefits
are similarly amended or terminated for all current or former employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries or for only current employees who are not
Currently Eligible Employees or Future Eligible Retirees.

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor,
in accordance with its terms and conditions, (i) each collective bargaining
agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, (ii) each
existing employment, change in control, severance and termination protection
plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and any officer, director or employee of the Company that is disclosed under
Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (iii) all existing
obligations and/or accrued benefits under any employee benefit plan, policy,
program or arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are
disclosed under Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (iv)
except as otherwise provided in an individual employment agreement, all
obligations and/or accrued benefits under all plans, programs or agreements of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that provide for bonuses that are
disclosed under Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee of the Company in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) with Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Nothing contained herein shall preclude Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any

  

  

48

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

Company Employee or changing the terms and conditions of employment applicable
to any Company Employee at any time and for any reason to the extent permitted
by applicable Law. Nothing contained in this Section 6.8 shall (i) amend, or
be deemed to amend, any Company Plan, (ii) provide any Person not a party to
this Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with regard to any Company
Plan or a right to enforce any provision of this Agreement, or (iii), except
as otherwise provided in this Section 6.8, limit in any way the Surviving
Corporation's ability to amend or terminate any Company Plan at any time in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

  

  

Section 6.9 Rockville PSA. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause the Rockville Seller to (i) comply in all
material respects with its obligations and covenants under the Rockville PSA
and (ii) enforce in all material respects all covenants and obligations of the
Rockville Purchaser under the Rockville PSA.

  

  

Section 6.10 State Takeover Laws. The Company and Parent and their respective
Boards of Directors shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
restrictions of no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and
(b) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, or any of the other Transactions, use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger, and the other
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

  

  

Section 6.11 Shareholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in and, if Parent so elects, the Company and Parent
shall reasonably cooperate with respect to, the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to the Offer, this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and shall not settle or offer to settle any such litigation without
the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

  

CONDITIONS

  

  

Section 7.1 Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligations to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to
the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each of the following

required by the DGCL;

49

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

the consummation of the Merger, and there shall be no order or injunction of a
court of competent jurisdiction in effect prohibiting consummation of the
Merger; provided, however, that subject to the terms and provisions herein
provided (including but not limited to Section 6.6 of this Agreement) prior to
invoking this condition each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have any such decree, ruling, order or injunction vacated.

  

  

(c) Parent, Purchaser or their affiliates shall have purchased, or caused to
be purchased, the Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, whether before or
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

  

  

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent, Purchaser and the Company at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time; or

  

  

(b) By either Parent or the Company if:

  

  

(i) prior to the Acceptance Time, a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity shall have issued an order or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the
Transactions (including each of the Offer and the Merger), and such order or
action shall have become final and unappealable; provided however that the
right to terminate the Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not be
available to a party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the issuance of
such order or the taking of such action; or

  

  

(ii) on or after the Outside Date if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred by such date; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Offer to be consummated on or
before the Outside Date; for purposes of this Agreement, the "Outside Date"
shall be February 29, 2012 provided that if, as of such date, the waiting
period, and any extensions thereof, applicable to the Transactions pursuant to
the HSR Act shall have not expired or been terminated, or there is a pending
action by any Governmental Entity seeking to prohibit or restrict Parent's
ownership of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the operation by Parent
of any of its or the Company's businesses or assets, then, unless the failure
to expire or terminate or such action relates to a Divestiture Action which
Parent is not obligated to take pursuant to Section 6.6(d)(iii) and Parent has
notified the Company that it does

  

  

50

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

not intend to take such Divestiture Action, either Parent or the Company may,
in its sole discretion, extend such date to a date no later than June 30,
2012; or

  

  

(c) By Parent if:

  

  

(i) prior to the Acceptance Time (A) a Recommendation Withdrawal occurs, or
the Company recommends, adopts or approves any Company Acquisition Proposal or
(B) the Company Board of Directors shall have failed to publicly confirm the
Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a
written request by Parent that it do so after the Company receives or
otherwise becomes aware of a Company Acquisition Proposal; or

  

  

(ii) prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall have breached or failed
to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained
in this Agreement which (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of Annex I hereto and (B) is not cured
or is incapable of being cured by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after
the giving of written notice to the Company or (y) the Outside Date; provided,
that Parent or Purchaser is not then in material breach of this Agreement; or

  

  

(iii) Parent or Purchaser shall have terminated the Offer, or the Offer shall
have expired, without Parent or Purchaser purchasing any Shares pursuant
thereto; provided, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(c)(iii) if it or Purchaser is in material breach of this
Agreement; or

  

  

(iv) prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company materially breaches the
covenants contained in Section 6.3 of this Agreement; or

  

  

(v) prior to the Acceptance Time, the trustees of the trust holding Class A
Shares under the BNA 401(k) Plan shall have determined not to permit
participants in the BNA 401(k) Plan to elect whether or not to tender Class A
Shares pursuant to the Offer; or

  

  

(d) By the Company if:

  

  

(i) prior to the Acceptance Time, a Recommendation Withdrawal occurs in order
to approve and permit the Company to execute a definitive agreement providing
for a Superior Proposal or as a result of an Intervening Event; provided that
the Company shall have first complied with Section 6.3(c) of this Agreement;
and further provided that simultaneously with any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i), the Company shall pay to Parent
the Termination Fee (as defined below); or

  

  

(ii) prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent or the Purchaser shall have breached
or failed to perform any of the representations, warranties,

  

  

51

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which (A) would reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (B) is not cured or
is incapable of being cured by the earlier of (x) thirty (30) days after the
giving of written notice to Parent or (y) the Outside Date; or

  

  

(iii) Parent or Purchaser shall have terminated the Offer, or the Offer shall
have expired, without Parent or Purchaser purchasing any Shares pursuant
thereto; provided, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(d)(iii) if the Company is in material breach of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section
8.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or
parties specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
(except for the second sentence of Section 6.2, and for Sections 9.2, 9.3,
9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.11, 9.13, 9.15 and this Section 8.2, which shall
survive such termination) and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, Purchaser or the Company, except (i) as set forth in Section 6.2 and
this Section 8.2, (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability
for damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of fraud or
any breach of this Agreement that is willful or intentional, and (iii) claims
for a breach of Section 4.7 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) If:

  

  

(i) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i)
or Section 8.1(c)(iv);

  

  

(ii) the Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i); or

  

  

(iii) (A) either (w) Parent or the Company shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), (x) Parent shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii), (y) Parent shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) due to a failure to
satisfy the Minimum Condition or pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(v) or (z) the
Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii),
(B) prior to termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii),
8.1(c)(ii), 8.1(c)(iii), 8.1(c)(v) or 8.1(d)(iii), a Person shall have made or
publicly announced a Company Acquisition Proposal that was not bona fide and
irrevocably withdrawn at the time of termination and (C) within twelve (12)
months after any such termination either (1) the Company enters into an
agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or (2) a Company
Acquisition Proposal is consummated; provided, that for the purpose of this
Section 8.2(b)(iii), all references in the definition of "Company Acquisition
Proposal" to "20%" shall instead be deemed to refer to "50%";

  

  

52

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee (A) concurrently with
such termination in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i),
(B) within five (5) Business Days after such termination in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(i) or Section 8.1(c)(iv) and (C) upon
the earlier of the entry into an agreement with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of a Company Acquisition Proposal in
the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), 8.1(c)(ii),
8.1(c)(iii), 8.1(c)(v) or 8.1(d)(iii). The Termination Fee shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Parent may
designate in writing to the Company. In the event this Agreement is terminated
either (x) pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), 8.1(c)(iii), 8.1(c)(v), or
8.1(d)(iii) at a time when all of the conditions to the Offer set forth on
Annex I other than the Minimum Condition (and those conditions which by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Acceptance Time such as condition (ii)(e))
are satisfied, or (y) pursuant to 8.1(c)(ii), the Company shall pay Parent or
its designees by wire transfer, as promptly as practicable (but in any event
within two (2) Business Days) reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses
and fees incurred by Parent or Purchaser in connection with the Transactions
up to a maximum of $10 million (the "Expense Reimbursement"), which shall be
credited against the Termination Fee to the extent the Termination Fee is
ultimately payable by the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement (including in Section 9.9) other than the proviso to this
sentence, the parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee and the
Expense Reimbursement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
Parent and Purchaser with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions in
the event the Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement becomes due and payable
under the terms of this Agreement, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee,
the Company shall have no further liability to Parent and Purchaser hereunder;
provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply in the event of any
liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by Parent or Purchaser in the case
of a breach of this Agreement involving fraud or willful or intentional
misconduct.

  

  

(iv) As used in this Agreement, "Termination Fee" means $40 million; provided,
however, if the Termination Fee is payable with respect to a termination
arising out of an Intervening Event, the Termination Fee shall be one and one-
half times (1.5x) such amount.

  

  

(c) If: (A) either (x) Parent or the Company shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i) in connection with Antitrust Law or
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), (y) Parent shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iii) or (z) the Company shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii); (B) at the time of
such termination, all of the conditions to the Offer set forth on Annex I
other than (ii)(f)(i) shall have been satisfied; and (C) the failure of
condition (ii)(f)(i) of Annex I is due to the election of Parent pursuant to
Section 6.6(d)(iii) not to take a Divestiture Action with respect to any asset
or business other than its legal publication assets or businesses, then Parent
shall pay the Company a fee equal to the Termination Fee (the "Reverse
Termination Fee"): (A) concurrently with such termination in the case of a
termination by Parent or (B) within five (5) Business Days after such
termination in the case of a termination by the Company. The Reverse
Termination Fee shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to such account as the Company may designate in writing to Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including in
Section 9.9), the parties agree that the payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company with
respect to

  

  

53

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

this Agreement and the Transactions in the event the Reverse Termination Fee
becomes due and payable under the terms of this Agreement, and, upon payment
of the Reverse Termination Fee, Parent and Purchaser shall have no further
liability to the Company hereunder.

  

  

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the damages
resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a
Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement is payable by the Company or the
Reverse Termination Fee is payable by Parent, are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section
8.2(b) and 8.2(c) are not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the recipient for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement.

otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The words
describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa. The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.
Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement, the Table of Contents
and the Index of Defined Terms are for the convenience of the parties only and
shall be given no substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever.

  

  

Section 9.7 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby expressly and irrevocably
submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery or, if said court lacks jurisdiction by virtue of federal Law, any
court of the United States located in the State of Delaware (the "Delaware
Court") in connection with all disputes arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such court. Each such party hereby waives the right
to any other jurisdiction or venue for any litigation arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the

  

  

56

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

Transactions to which any of them may be entitled by reason of its present or
future domicile. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such party agrees that
each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any action or
proceeding for enforcement of a Judgment entered by the Delaware Court in any
other court or jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably waives any and all right
to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions.

  

  

Section 9.8 Service of Process. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in any such action or proceeding by
mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to
Section 9.5 of this Agreement. However, the foregoing shall not limit the
right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other
legally available method.

  

  

Section 9.9 Specific Performance. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement,
each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could
not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto (i) will waive, in any action for specific performance, the
defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and (ii) shall be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at Law or in equity, to
compel specific performance of this Agreement and to injunctive relief, and
the parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such specific performance
or injunctive relief. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the
Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches of or enforce compliance with those
covenants of Parent or Purchaser that require Parent or Purchaser to
consummate the Transactions. The Company\'s pursuit of specific performance at
any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled,
including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or
suffered by the Company in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving
fraud or willful or intentional misconduct.

  

  

Section 9.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile by the parties hereto, in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
a counterpart of this Agreement shall have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

Section 9.11 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof (provided that the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any
conflicting provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement). Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other

Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Purchaser of any of its
obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement

cause Purchaser to take such action and a guarantee of the payment and
performance thereof. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied
in this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection with
the Transactions, the Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of
recovery against, and no liability shall attach to, the former, current or
future stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or
Representatives of Parent or Purchaser, whether by or through attempted
