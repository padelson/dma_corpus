performance metric set forth in the 2015 LTIP as of the Closing, in a form

Section 2.6. _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and cause to be
delivered to Seller a statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth, in reasonable detail, Buyers good faith calculation of (i) the final
Net Working Capital (the " _Final NWC_ ") and the final NWC Adjustment based
on the Final NWC (the " _Final NWC Adjustment_ __ "), (ii) the final Closing
Cash (the " _Final Closing Cash_ "), (iii) the final Closing Indebtedness
(the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ __ "), (iv) the amount and calculation of
the Final Closing Payment, and (v) the amount, if any, by which the Final
Closing Payment so determined is greater than or less than the
Estimated Closing Payment (such positive or negative amount, the " _Post-
Closing Adjustment_ _Amount_ ").

 

(b) The Final Closing Statement shall be prepared, and the Final NWC, the
Final NWC Adjustment, the Final Closing Cash, and the Final Closing
Indebtedness (collectively, the " _Final Calculations_ ") shall be calculated,
in accordance with the Accounting Principles and/or the definitions thereof,
as applicable.

 

(c) Upon receipt of the Final Closing Statement, Seller and its accountants
shall be permitted during the succeeding sixty (60) day period (the " _Review
Period_ ") reasonable access during business hours to the relevant personnel
and Representatives of Buyer, and any relevant documents, schedules or
workpapers used by them in the preparation of the Final Calculations.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, Buyer and the Group Companies shall not be
obligated to take any action that would violate any Law or the terms of any
Contract or confidentiality obligation to which Buyer or any Group Company is
a party, or result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work-
product doctrine; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements
under circumstances in which the foregoing restrictions apply.

(d) If Seller disagrees with any of the Final Calculations, on or prior to
the last day of the Review Period, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of
such disagreement, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the item
or items of the Final Calculations to which such disagreement relates and the
basis for each such disagreement (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If Seller
fails to deliver the Objection Notice (or fails to object in the Objection
Notice to any items or amounts included in the Final Calculations) within the
Review Period, the Final Calculations as determined by Buyer (or such items
and

 



15  amounts included in the Final Calculations to which Seller has not objected
in a timely delivered Objection Notice) shall be deemed to have been accepted
by Seller and shall be final and binding and used in computing the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount. If Seller delivers the Objection Notice within the
Review Period, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_ below, then (i) the Final
Closing Statement, as prepared and delivered by Buyer, shall not be binding
on any party hereto, (ii) Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such items and amounts as are disputed in the Objection Notice, and
(iii) any resolution agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto.

(e) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.6(d)_ within forty-five (45) days after
delivery of the Objection Notice, then Buyer and Seller shall engage the
dispute resolution group of a nationally recognized independent public
accounting firm or financial consulting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and
Seller, other than any such firm that currently provides services to Buyer,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (the "
_Independent Auditor_ "), who shall, acting as experts and not as
arbitrators, resolve the dispute set forth in the Objection Notice. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne by the parties in
proportion to the relative amount each partys determination has been
modified. For example, if Seller challenges the calculation of the Final
Closing Payment by an amount of $100,000, but the Independent Auditor
determines that Seller has a valid claim for only $40,000, Buyer shall bear
40% of the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor and Seller shall bear
the other 60% of such fees and expenses.

 

(f) The parties shall instruct the Independent Auditor to consider only
those items and amounts which are identified in the Objection Notice as being
items which Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve. Further, the Independent
Auditors determination shall be based solely on the relevant work papers and
books and records relating to the Group Companies and any other written
information provided by Buyer and Seller to the extent related to Buyers or
Sellers calculation of the amounts in dispute, which are in accordance with
the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis
of an independent review), and the Independent Auditor shall not conduct
additional discovery in any form. The Independent Auditors determination of
each disputed item shall be within the range for such item proposed by Buyer
and Seller in the Final Closing Statement and the Objection Notice.

(g) The parties shall jointly instruct the Independent Auditor to make a
determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other
time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after its engagement (i)
whether the Final Closing Statement and the Final Calculations were prepared
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or, alternatively, and (ii)
only with respect to the disputed items identified in the Objection Notice,
the Independent Auditors final determination of such items and a
written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required adjustment,
including the basis therefor. All negotiations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.6_ shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes
of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of
evidence, and all negotiations and submissions to the Independent Auditor
shall be treated as confidential information. The Independent Auditor shall be
bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement. The procedures of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the
determinations of the Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on the
parties. The decision of the Independent Auditor rendered pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(f)_ may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Either party may seek specific enforcement or take other
necessary legal action to enforce any decision under this _Section_ __ _
2.6(f)_. The other partys only defense to such a request for specific
enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or upon the Independent
Auditor. Absent such fraud, such other party shall reimburse the party
seeking enforcement for its expenses related to such enforcement.

(h) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, is negative, then Buyer and Seller shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to (i) release to Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow
Fund an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount and (ii) release
to Seller any remaining portion of the Adjustment Escrow Fund. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the Adjustment Escrow Fund is the only source of
recovery against Seller for any negative Post-Closing Adjustment Amount.

 



16 (i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount, as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, is positive, then (i) Buyer shall pay
(or cause to be paid) an aggregate amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount to Seller and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
release the entire Adjustment Escrow Fund to Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Buyer be liable to Seller for any positive Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount in excess of $10,000,000.

 

(j) The Post-Closing Adjustment Amount process set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 2.6_ shall be the exclusive remedy of Seller and Buyer for any disputes
related to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount.

(k) Once the final Aggregate Consideration is determined in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ __ and this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ (and after giving
effect to any adjustments thereto resulting from any indemnification payments
hereunder), then, for all purposes under this Agreement, references herein to
the "Aggregate Consideration" shall mean and refer to the Aggregate
Consideration, as so determined and adjusted.

 

Section 2.7. _Withholding_. Buyer (and its agents) and the Company, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount payable
to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Buyer or the
Company, as applicable, determine in good faith are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or under any other applicable Law relating
to Taxes. To the extent any such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(b) Each Group Company is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
to do business as a legal entity in each foreign jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed, or in good standing would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material
to such Group Company.

 

Section 3.2. _Authority Relative to the Transaction Documents_. The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, to

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by the Company, have been duly and
validly authorized by all requisite corporate action. This Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to which the Company is a party, when executed and
delivered by or on behalf of the Company and all other parties thereto, shall
constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms,
subject, in each case, to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,

to which it is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except where the failure to obtain such permit,
authorization, consent, license, exemption, order or approval, or to make such
filing or notification, would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect,
in any material respect, any Group Companys ability to perform or comply
with the covenants, agreements or obligations of the Group Companies herein or
in any other Transaction Document or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(b) Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ of the Disclosure

retain business that (i) would cause any Group Company to be in violation of
the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the " _FCPA_ ") or
any other anti-corruption or anti-bribery or similar law or regulation
applicable to the Group Companies (collectively with the FCPA, the "
_Anticorruption Laws_ ") or (ii) the purpose or effect of which would

(b) Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.12(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, with respect to each Benefit Plan: (i) such Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in compliance, with its terms and all applicable Law
and regulations (including ERISA and the Code), and the Company, each Company
Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate has performed all obligations required to
be performed by it under, is not in default under or in violation of, and has

to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing claims against, by or
on behalf of any Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits under
the terms of any such Benefit Plan) including any audit or inquiry by the

is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Code Section
401(a) (" _Qualified Plans_ ") has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS or, with respect to a prototype or volume submitter plan, can
rely on an opinion letter from the IRS to the document sponsor, to the effect
that such Qualified Plan is so qualified and that the plan and the trust
related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, and there are no circumstances and no
events that have occurred since the issuance of the most recent applicable IRS
determination letter that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the related trust.
All individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any Benefit Plan, are entitled
to participate in any Benefit Plan, are currently participating in such
Benefit Plan or have been offered an opportunity to do so and have declined in

ERISA) that is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor any pension plan for the benefit of
employees who perform services outside the United States. No Group Company or

Person). No Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" as
defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA. No Benefit Plan is a multiple employer
plan maintained by more than one employer as defined in Section 413(c) of the

fiduciary thereof or (iii) any of the assets of any trust of any Benefit
Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or U.S.

audit by any Governmental Entity. There has been no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction," as such term is defined under Section 4975 of the Code, Section
406 of ERISA, or any applicable Law, with respect to any Benefit Plan for
which any Group Company could be liable (either directly or through
indemnification).

(e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is subject
to any Liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or
Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Benefit Plans. All contributions
required to be made by the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to
any Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due dates and a reasonable
amount has been accrued for contributions to each Benefit Plan for the current
plan years (and no further contributions will be due or will have accrued
thereunder as of the Closing Date, other than contributions accrued in the
Ordinary Course of Business after the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date as a
result of the

 



26  operations of the Group Companies after the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date).

Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and ERISA
Affiliates have at all times made timely deposits of employee salary reduction
contributions and participant loan repayments, as determined pursuant to

Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Each Benefit Plan can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, without Liability to Buyer and/or any Subsidiary
(other than ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a
termination event). With respect to each Benefit Plan subject to ERISA as
either an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of

requisite reports to the applicable Governmental Entity (which were true,

posted with respect to each such Benefit Plan.

Act of 1967, as amended, and (vi) the applicable requirements of the Womens
Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 and the regulations (including proposed
regulations) thereunder. 

(g) Each Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the " _2010 Health Care Law_ "), to
the extent applicable to such plan. The operation of each Benefit Plan will
not result in the incurrence of any material penalty to the Company pursuant
to the 2010 Health Care Law, to the extent applicable to such plan.

(h) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or other ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Benefit Plan that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such
Benefit Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to such Benefit
Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Financial Statements. No
Benefit Plan will be subject to any surrender fees or service fees upon
termination other than the normal and reasonable administrative fees
associated with the termination of benefit plans.

all Contracts to which any Group Company is a party relating to (A) the
privacy of users of their products and services that share personally
identifiable information with the Group Companies and (B) the use, collection,
storage, disclosure, receipt and transfer of any personally identifiable
information collected, accessed or obtained by the Group Companies. None of
the Group Companies has received a written (or to the Knowledge of the
Company, oral) third-party complaint regarding the Companys use,
collection, storage, disclosure, receipt or transfer of personally
identifiable information that would constitute a violation of the PII
Statements or applicable Law.

Supplier is listed on _Section_ __ _ 3.19_ of the Disclosure Schedule. Since

Material Supplier that such supplier shall not continue as a supplier to the
Group Companies (or Buyer) after the Closing or that such Material Supplier
intends to terminate or materially modify existing Contracts with the Group
Companies. Each of the Group Companies has access, on commercially reasonable
terms, to all products and services reasonably necessary to carry on their
business as currently conducted and currently proposed to be conducted, and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason why the Group Companies
will not continue to have such access on commercially reasonable terms.

(ii) prior to Closing, each Group Company shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its operations, and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, no consent of Buyer shall be required with respect to any
matter set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, to
the extent the requirements of such consent would, upon advice of the
Companys counsel, violate any applicable Law.

 

Section 6.2. _Access and Information_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to, afford Buyer or its Representatives reasonable access, upon
reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours to the Group
Companies executive personnel listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule and to the Group Companies properties, Contracts, books
and records, and other documents and data; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
any such access shall be conducted at Buyers expense, under the reasonable
supervision of Company personnel and in such a manner as to maintain the
confidentiality of such information and not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal operation of the business of the Group Companies, (ii) neither Buyer
nor any of Buyers Representatives shall contact, directly or indirectly,
except in the ordinary course of Buyers business, any employee, customer or
supplier of a Group Company without the Companys prior written consent, which
may be withheld in the Companys reasonable discretion and (iii) no Group
Company shall have any obligation to disclose any information to Buyer to the
extent such disclosure would (A) result in a material breach of any agreement
to which any Group Company is a party or is otherwise bound, (B) reasonably
be expected to jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege of any
Group Company, or (C) result in a violation of any Laws or fiduciary duties
applicable to any Group Company; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances in which the foregoing restrictions set forth
in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above apply. The information delivered to Buyer
or its authorized representatives pursuant to this Agreement, including this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Buyer shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to properly retain and
maintain the Tax and accounting records of the Group Companies that relate to
Pre-Closing Periods or Straddle Periods for a period of six (6) years after
Closing, to the extent that such records are in the Group Companies
possession as of Closing, and shall thereafter provide Seller with written
notice prior to any destruction, abandonment or disposition of all or any
portions of such records, (ii) transfer such records to Seller upon its
written request prior to any such destruction, abandonment or disposition and
(iii) afford Seller and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books and records, information, employees and auditors

useful in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or Legal
Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, with regard to (ii), Seller agrees
to reimburse Buyer promptly for all reasonable and 

 



42  documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
activities. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Buyer and the Group Companies shall
not be obligated to take any action that would violate any Law or the terms of
any Contract or confidentiality obligation to which Buyer or any Group Company
is a party, or result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work-
product doctrine; _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements
under circumstances in which the foregoing restrictions apply.

Section 6.3. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely
file or cause to be timely filed, at Buyers expense, all Tax Returns of the
Group Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods (such Tax Returns, the " _Pre-
Closing Period Tax Returns_"), and for all taxable periods which begin before
and end after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Periods_ ") (such Tax Returns, "
_Straddle Period Tax Returns_ "). Except as otherwise required by applicable
Law, Buyer shall prepare and file such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns and
Straddle Period Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the prior practices of
the Group Companies. Buyer shall permit Seller to review and comment on each
Pre-Closing Period Tax Return and Straddle Period Tax Return at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax
Return and shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested by
Seller. Buyer shall timely pay all Taxes due as reflected on such Pre-Closing
Tax Returns and Straddle Period Returns. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, all deductions related to Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness,
or other amounts paid or accrued on or prior to the Closing Date shall be
allocated to and reflected upon the Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, Buyer shall be
entitled to be reimbursed from the Indemnity Escrow Fund for (i) any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer in preparing and filing
such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns and Straddle Period Tax Returns, and (ii)
payment of all Taxes due as reflected on such Pre-Closing Tax Returns and, for
the portion allocable to the Pre-Closing Periods covered thereby, such
Straddle Period Returns, to the extent such Taxes have not been taken into
account in the calculation of Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or Transaction
Expenses.

(b) _Apportionment of Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Taxes of a Group Company that are payable with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes allocable to
the Pre-Closing Periods shall: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A)
based upon or related to income or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with
any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or assignment
of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended on the Closing
Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause (i)
above) that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or
assets of a Group Company or otherwise measured by the level of any item, be
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. For purposes of
clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item (including the effect of any graduated rates of Tax) that is
calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to the Straddle Period
times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period. In the
case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or
long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ shall be computed by reference to
the level of such items on the Closing Date. The parties hereto will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant Governmental
Entity to treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short taxable period
ending as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

 



43 (c) _Post-Closing Actions_. Without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed,
except as required to cause the Group Companies Tax Returns to be consistent
with applicable Law as determined pursuant to a more likely than not
standard, Buyer shall not, with respect to the Group Companies: (i) amend,
refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to a
Pre-Closing Period, (ii) extend or waive any statute of limitations or other
period for the assessment of any Tax that relates to a Pre-Closing Period,
(iii) apply to any Governmental Entity for any binding or non-binding
opinion, ruling, or other determination, or voluntarily initiate any
discussion or make any voluntary disclosure with any Governmental Entity, with
respect to the Group Companies for any Pre-Closing Period, (iv) report any Tax
deduction related to the Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness or any
compensatory amounts or transaction expenses that are paid or accrued on or
before the Closing Date on any Tax Return of the Group Companies, Buyer or
their respective Affiliates for any taxable period or portion of a Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date, (v) change any Tax election of the
Group Companies for a Pre-Closing Period, or (vi) file any Tax Return for any
Pre-Closing Period for any of the Group Companies in a jurisdiction where such
Group Company has not previously filed Tax Returns, in each case, solely to
the extent the foregoing action will result in indemnification of a Buyer
Indemnified Party for Indemnifiable Damages payable out of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund pursuant to _Article IX_.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_
and any Tax proceeding. Such cooperation shall include signing any Tax
Returns, amended Tax Returns, claims or other documents necessary to settle
any Tax proceeding, execution of powers of attorney, the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax proceeding or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereby.

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Any sales, use, real estate transfer, stock
transfer, stamp, value added or similar transfer Tax (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. Buyer shall duly and
timely prepare and file any Tax Return relating to such Taxes. Buyer shall
give Seller a copy of each such Tax Return within five (5) days after filing
such Tax Return. Buyer shall timely pay all Taxes due as reflected on such
Tax Returns; _provided_ , that, Buyer shall be entitled to be reimbursed from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund for one-half of any such Transfer Taxes paid by
Buyer to the extent such Taxes have not been taken into account in the
calculation of Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses.

(f) _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent included as an asset in the
calculation of Net Working Capital or attributable to the carryback of any
loss from a taxable period commencing after the Closing Date, any cash refund
of Taxes of the Group Companies for any Pre-Closing Period received by Buyer
prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release Date that individually is in excess of
$100,000 (such amounts of refunds of Taxes referred to herein as
"Refunds") shall be for the account of Seller, but only if, and to the
extent, such Taxes were (i) actually paid by Seller prior to the Closing, (ii)
paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, or (iii) included in the calculation
of Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses. Buyer shall
promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller any such Refund (less any Taxes or
other reasonable costs or expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the
receipt of the Refund) promptly after the applicable Refund is received.

 



44 Section 6.4. _Section 338(h)(10) Election._

 

(a) Seller shall join Buyer in making the election provided by Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations,
and any comparable election under state, local or foreign Tax law (the "
_Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_"). The Parties shall cooperate fully in
making the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including the filing of all required
IRS forms and related forms under state, local or foreign Tax law. Seller
shall, on or prior to the Closing Date, prepare, execute and deliver to Buyer
an IRS Form 8023 and any related forms under state, local or foreign Tax law
(the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Forms_"). Seller shall deliver drafts of the
Section 338(h)(10) Forms to Buyer for its review and approval at least five
(5) Business Days prior to Closing. Buyer shall execute such IRS Form 8023 and
any related forms under state, local or foreign Tax Law and shall timely file
all such forms with the applicable Taxing Authority.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) Business Days after the Final NWC Adjustment is
determined in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, but no later than sixty
(60) Business Days before the due date for filing IRS Form 8883, Buyer shall
provide Seller with a completed schedule allocating the Aggregate
Consideration among the assets of the Company prepared in accordance with the
methodology reflected on _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Allocation Methodology_ ") and Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10)
Allocation Schedule_"), for Sellers review and comment. Buyer shall consider
in good faith Sellers reasonable comments on the Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Schedule provided within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of
the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule, after which the Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Schedule will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

 

(c) Buyer shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days following the
finalization of the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_, prepare IRS Form 8883, with all attachments,

the IRS Form 8883 to Seller.

 

(d) The Parties shall (i) file all Tax Returns (including IRS Forms 8023
and 8883) in a manner that is consistent with the Allocation Methodology and
the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule; (ii) not take a position on any
Tax Return, before any Tax authority or in any judicial proceeding that is in
any way inconsistent with the Allocation Methodology or the Section
338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule; (iii) cooperate with each other as reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax
Returns related to the Allocation Methodology and the Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Schedule; and (iv) promptly advise each other regarding the
existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to the
Allocation Methodology or the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule. If the
Aggregate Consideration is adjusted in any manner as provided in this
Agreement, the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted as
mutually agreed by the parties to reflect such adjustments in accordance with
the Allocation Methodology.

Section 6.5. _Consents and Approvals; Antitrust Laws_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, prior to the Closing,
each party hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to, consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining any (i)
Required Approvals and (ii) consents required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby listed on _Section_ __ _
6.5(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that neither Seller nor any
Group Company shall be obligated to pay any amounts to third parties (other
than fees and expenses of counsel or other advisors to Seller or the Group
Companies) in connection with obtaining any consents related to Contracts of
the Group Companies.

 



45 (b) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement
(but, in any event, within ten (10) days following the date hereof), each of
Buyer and the Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to make any filings
required of it or any of its Affiliates under and in compliance with any
applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) thereafter shall use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with one another in connection with any filing under

or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
initiated by any Antitrust Authority. Buyer and the Company shall each pay
one-half of all filing fees required under the HSR Act.

(c) Each of Buyer and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable Antitrust
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the context of
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_, "reasonable best efforts" shall include, in
the case of Buyer and the Company, if either receives a formal request for
additional information or documentary material from a Governmental
Entity, substantially complying with such formal request within ninety (90)
days following the date of its receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, it is expressly understood and agreed that (i)
Buyer shall not have any obligation to litigate or contest any Legal
Proceeding challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law and (ii) Buyer shall be under no obligation to
proffer, make proposals, negotiate, execute, carry out or submit to
agreements or Orders providing for (A) the sale, transfer, license,
divestiture, encumbrance or other disposition or holding separate (through the
establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets, categories of assets,
operations or categories of operations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or of
the Company, (B) the discontinuation of any product or service of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates or of the Company, (C) the licensing or provision of any

Affiliates or of the Company to any Person, (D) the imposition of any
limitation or regulation on the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to

separate of the Shares or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares or
(F) any actions that are not conditioned on the consummation of the Closing
(any one or more of the foregoing, an " _Antitrust Restraint_ ").

 

(d) Each of Buyer and the Company shall promptly inform the other of any
material communication between such party and any Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to Applicable
Law relating to the exchange of information, Buyer shall have the right (i) to
direct all matters with any Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions
and (ii) to review in advance, and direct the revision of, any filing,
application, notification or other document to be submitted by the Company to
any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Law; _provided_ that Buyer
shall consult with the Company and consider in good faith the views of the
Company in any such filing, application, notification or other document. If
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer receives any formal or informal request for
supplemental information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then Buyer shall
make or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a response in
compliance with such request. If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company
receives any formal or informal request for supplemental information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, then the Company shall make or cause to be
made, a response in compliance with such request. Neither party shall, without
the prior written consent of the other party, permit any of the partys
representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity relating to the transactions contemplated hereby unless the party
participating in such meeting consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, grants the other party the
opportunity to attend and lead the discussions at such meeting. The Company
will not proffer, make proposals, negotiate, execute, carry out or submit to
any agreements or Orders providing for any actions that would constitute an
Antitrust Restraint; _provided_ that the Company shall, if directed by Buyer,
agree to any such action that is conditioned on the consummation of the
Closing.

 



46 Section 6.6. _Public Announcements_. The press release announcing the
consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued
in a form prepared by Buyer, subject to the reasonable consent of the Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor Seller may, whether directly or
indirectly, issue any press release or make any other announcement disclosing
the existence of this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereby without the
prior written consent of Buyer, except where such a press release or other
announcement is required by Law, as reasonably determined by outside counsel
to the party seeking to make such announcement, in which event, such party
shall give notice to Buyer of such determination prior to such release or
announcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer may make such public communications
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby as Buyer may
determine is reasonably appropriate, but any such communications shall be
subject to the reasonable consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 6.7. _No Solicitation_. The Company and Seller shall, and shall
cause their Representatives and Affiliates to, cease and terminate any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties (other than
Buyer) conducted heretofore with respect to any action that would constitute
an Acquisition Proposal. From the date hereof through the earlier to occur of
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ ,
neither Seller nor the Company shall, directly or indirectly (through an
Affiliate or Representative or otherwise), solicit, initiate or conduct any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or otherwise
cooperate in any other way with, or facilitate or encourage any effort to
attempt to, or enter into any agreement or understanding with, any Person or
group of Persons (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) regarding any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company and Seller agree not to waive any rights
under, and not modify or amend, any confidentiality, non-disclosure or other
similar agreements with any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) that
has received confidential information of the Group Companies in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall immediately (but in any
event, within 24 hours) notify Buyer orally and in writing after receipt by
the Company (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any of the Companys
Representatives), of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any other
notice that any Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or (iv)
any request for non-public information relating to the Company or for access
to any of the properties, books or records of the Company by any Person or
Persons other than Buyer and its Representatives. Such notice shall describe
(A) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request and (B) the
identity of the Person or Persons making any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request. The
Company shall keep Buyer fully informed of the status and details of, and any
modification to, any such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer
and any correspondence or communications related thereto and shall provide to
Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of such inquiry, expression of
interest, proposal or offer and any amendments, correspondence and
communications related thereto, if in writing, or a reasonable written
summary thereof, if not in writing.

Section 6.8. _Employees; Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) If and to the extent that Buyer maintains benefit plans that will cover
Business Employees after the Closing, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to give each Business Employee full credit for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of benefits (including, for purposes
of vacation and severance, but excluding U.S. and non-U.S. equity compensation
plans, U.S.

 



47  and non-U.S. incentive compensation plans, executive compensation plans,
executive compensation arrangements, other pension plans (whether or not tax-
qualified) and its non-U.S. benefit program) under any benefit plans
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for such Business Employees service
with the Group Companies to the same extent recognized by the Group Companies
immediately prior to the Closing, in each case, to the extent permitted by or
applicable to the terms of such plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

 

(b) The provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ are included for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto and nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.8_, whether express or implied, shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary
or other rights in any other Person, including any current or former
employees, any participant in any Benefit Plan, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, (ii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of
or limitation on the ability to terminate any Benefit Plans or benefit plans
or agreements of Buyer, (iii) duplicate any benefit provided to any
Continuing Employee or operate to fund any such benefit; (iv) require Buyer or
its subsidiaries or Affiliates to pay for any benefits that relate to any time
period prior to the Business Employees participation in these plans or (iii)
limit the ability of Buyer or any Group Company to terminate the employment of
any Business Employee at any time.

 

Section 6.9. _Additional Efforts_. Following the Closing, as and when
requested by any party hereto and at such requesting partys expense, any
other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all
such further actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.10. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than six years after the Closing Date, the
Group Companies shall, and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to, maintain
on terms no less favorable than the current terms, and to honor in accordance
with such terms, the provisions of the Governing Documents of the Group
Companies as in effect on the date hereof with respect to exculpation and
indemnification of present and former directors, managers, and officers of any
Group Company (including provisions relating to contributions, advancement of
expenses and the like), it being the intent of the parties hereto that such
present and former directors, managers, officers, employees and agents will
continue to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification, and advancement
of expense to the fullest extent of the Law following the Closing Date.

 

(b) Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to (i) for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date, maintain in effect the current policies of
directors, officers and fiduciaries liability insurance maintained by the
Group Companies immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Existing D andO
Policy_"), if available, or (ii) obtain as of the Closing Date "tail"
insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail_") covering those persons who, as of
immediately prior to the Closing, are covered by the Existing DandO Policy, with
a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date and on terms no less
favorable than those of the Existing DandO Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event will Buyer (or, following the Closing Date, any of the
Group Companies) be required to pay in excess of 200% of the annual premium
most recently paid by the Group Companies for such coverage; _provided_
___further_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such coverage
is not available (or is only available for an amount in excess of 200% of the
annual premium most recently paid by the Group Companies for such coverage),
Buyer shall nevertheless use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
such coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount. The negotiation and
purchase of the DandO Tail shall be controlled by Buyer in good faith
consultation with the Company, and will be placed with a broker mutually
agreed upon by Buyer and the Company. The parties expressly acknowledge and
agree that one-half of the premium of the DandO Tail shall be treated as a
Transaction Expense for all purposes hereunder.

 



48 Section 6.11. _Termination of Qualified Plans and Specified Plans_. The
Company shall, on or before the Closing Date, amend the ESOP (the " _ESOP
Amendment_ "), each other Qualified Plan, if any, and the Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan Amended and Restated Effective July 1, 2015 and
Amendment to the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Effective July 1, 2015
(the " _SERP_ ") each contingent upon the completion of the Closing and
effective as of the Closing Date, to (a) permanently
discontinue contributions to and terminate the ESOP, the SERP and any other
Qualified Plan, if any, and (b) convert the ESOP into a profit-sharing plan.
The ESOP Amendment, in the form attached hereto as _Schedule 6.11_ , shall
provide that, as soon as administratively feasible following the Closing
Date, the ESOP Trustee shall distribute up to 75% of the value of each ESOP
participants account balance in a single cash lump sum (with or without
participant consent), including accounts already in pay status (such value to
be determined without regard to the possible adjustment in the value of
amounts that are subject to the Escrow Agreement). At least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Buyer a draft
notice to the participants of the ESOP describing the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and stating that the pre-Closing Board of
Directors of the Company will permanently discontinue contributions to and
terminate the ESOP. The Company shall provide Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon such notice and any other
communications to the participants in the ESOP regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, the Company shall submit an
application in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer to the IRS requesting a
favorable determination with respect to the amendment and termination of the
ESOP. As soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt of such
determination letter and the final distribution of the funds held pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement, the ESOP Trustee shall distribute all remaining ESOP
account balances. Furthermore, such amendment to the ESOP shall provide that
(A) the ESOP Trustee is permitted to adopt such rules as it deems necessary or
advisable with respect to any ESOP participants rights to proceeds in the
Adjustment Escrow Fund pending release of any such amounts to Seller, and (B)
the ESOP shall remain in existence (albeit frozen) until such proceeds, if
any, are released to Seller and become available for distribution. The
Committee shall keep Buyer reasonably informed on the status of the ESOP
termination as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_. The amendments to
such other Qualified Plans, if any, and the SERP shall provide that, as soon
as administratively feasible following the Closing Date, but subject to any
applicable regulatory requirements and receipt of a final determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service, the applicable fiduciary will direct the
trustee of such Qualified Plan, if any, to distribute each participants
vested account balance in a single lump sum (with or without participant
consent), including accounts already in pay status. __ _ _

 

Section 6.12. _Post-Closing Administration of ESOP_.

 

(a) Seller agrees to assume and pay all costs and expenses incurred with
respect to the ESOP following the Closing Date that constitute administrative
expenses under ERISA, with any other such costs and expenses to be paid from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) The ESOP Administration Committee (the " _Committee_ "), as defined in
the ESOP, with Agnes Semington, Cindy Vetsch and David Potente as its members
will be authorized to act as the administrator of the ESOP. Unless otherwise
required to fulfill its fiduciary duties under ERISA or otherwise by ERISA,
Buyer shall not cause the Company to remove or replace such Committee members
following the Closing; provided that the Company may replace any member
following such individuals death, disability, termination of employment or
service with the Company and its ERISA Affiliates or resignation as a member
of the Committee. The ESOP plan document and ESOP Trust Agreement shall

 



49  be amended to provide that until the release of all Adjustment Escrow
Amounts pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement only
the Committee may remove the ESOP Trustee at any time following the Closing
Date; provided, however, that in all other respects the Company shall remain
authorized to manage and control the ESOP, including, without limitation,
amending the ESOP plan document and ESOP Trust Agreement in any way that it
determines to be necessary and appropriate (other than in a manner
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement), including amendments made at
the request of the IRS in connection with its issuance of a final
determination letter for the ESOP. Any trustee appointed by the Committee
shall be an independent corporate trustee, subject to ERISA fiduciary duties.

 

Section 6.13. _Termination of Options and Phantom Shares_. Prior to the
Closing, and subject to the prior review and approval of Buyer, Seller and
the Company shall terminate the Plan and any Options or Phantom Shares issued
thereunder (other than with respect to the Phantom Shares granted in September
2017) effective as of the Closing, including by delivering all required
notices, obtaining all necessary approvals and consents, and delivering
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that all necessary determinations by
the board of directors of the Company or applicable committee thereof
to terminate the Plan and all Options and Phantom Shares (other than with
respect to the Phantom Shares granted in September 2017) have been made.

 

Section 6.14. _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) comply with its
obligations under the Commitment Letter, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on substantially the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, but in no event later than the Closing, or on such
other terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer than
the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (provided that
such other terms could not reasonably be expected to delay or hinder the
Closing), (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in
the Commitment Letter (or definitive agreements entered into with respect to
the Commitment Letter), and (v) in the event that all conditions in the
Commitment Letter have been satisfied, cause the Financing Sources to fund the
Debt Financing at the Closing.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer will not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letter without the consent of
the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date
(unless Buyer has a sufficient amount of available cash on hand from other
sources to pay the amounts required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to _Article
II_ at Closing, and to pay all related fees and expenses), (ii) impose new
or additional conditions to, or expand any of the conditions to, the receipt
of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay,
impede or prevent the timely funding of the Debt Financing, or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing on the Closing
Date, or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
against the Financing Sources, provided, that for the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer may amend, amend and restate or replace the existing Commitment Letter
to (A) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and
(B) modify pricing and implement or exercise any "flex" provisions contained
in the Commitment Letter or any related fee letter. Buyer shall (i) furnish
the Company complete, correct and executed copies of any amendments,
restatements, supplements, amendment and restatements, modifications or
replacements to the Commitment Letter and (ii) give the

 



50  Company prompt notice of any breach by any party of the Commitment Letter of
which Buyer becomes aware or any termination thereof; provided that in no
event shall Buyer be under any obligation to disclose any information
pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) that would waive the protection of attorney-
client or similar privilege if such party shall have used reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such
privilege.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
(other than by reason of a breach of this Agreement by the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company) on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Commitment Letter (including any applicable flex provisions in any related fee
letter) and such portion is required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (i) Buyer shall promptly notify the Company
and (ii) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain any
such portion from alternative sources on terms, conditions and costs, taken
as whole, that are no more adverse to Buyer (including after giving effect to
the flex provisions) than those contained in the Commitment Letter as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, in the event that any portion of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions) and such portion is
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified
or superseded at the option of Buyer after the date of this Agreement
but prior to the Effective Time by instruments that either amend, amend and
restate, or replace the existing Commitment Letter or contemplate co-
investment by or financing from one or more other or additional parties;
provided that the terms of the such new or amended commitment letters shall
not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the
Closing Date (unless Buyer has a sufficient amount of available cash on hand
from other sources to pay the amounts required to be paid by Buyer pursuant
to _Article II_ at Closing, and to pay all related fees and expenses), (ii)
impose new or additional conditions to receipt of the Debt Financing, or
otherwise expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing,
in each case, in a manner that could reasonably be expected to delay, impede
or prevent the timely funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, or
the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing, or (iii)
adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the
Financing Sources. Buyer shall deliver to the Company true and correct copies
of all new or amended commitment letters (including redacted fee and
engagement letters in respect of any new or amended commitment letters). In
the event that the Commitment Letter is amended, restated, amended and
restated, supplemented, modified, or replaced, the term " _Commitment Letter_
" as used herein shall be deemed to include the new or amended commitment
letters described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ to the extent then in effect
and the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used herein shall be deemed to include
the financing contemplated by any such new or amended commitment letters.

7.1(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(f)_, and (b) a certificate signed by an
authorized representative of the ESOP Trustee, certifying to Buyer that the
ESOP Trustee has determined that, as of the date of delivery of such
certificate: (i) the consideration that Seller shall receive for the Shares
sold to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement is not less than "adequate
consideration" as that term is defined under Section 3(18)(B) of ERISA, (ii)
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taken as a whole, are fair
to the ESOP from a financial point of view, (iii) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are prudent and in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of the ESOP, and (iv) neither the Sellers
entry into this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will constitute a non-exempt "prohibited transaction"
under ERISA or the Code or result in the imposition of any tax under Section
4975 of the Code; _provided_ , that, the delivery of such certificate shall
not be deemed to have satisfied the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.1(j)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(g)_.

In the event of any termination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ (other
than pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_), written notice setting forth the
reasons therefor shall delivered promptly by the terminating party to the
other party.

hereto (or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and
financial advisors or other representatives), other than liability for
willful breaches of covenants, representations or warranties, or for actions
constituting fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ (Public Announcements), _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ (Effect of

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 9.1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties made by the Company, Seller and
Buyer herein and in the other certificates contemplated by this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation or disclosure made by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto, until the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date;
_provided_ that regardless of any investigation or disclosure made by or on
behalf of any of the parties hereto, the Fundamental Representations will
remain operative and in full force and effect until 60 days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as such statute of
limitations pertains to the subject matter of such Fundamental Representation,
or to the ability of an Indemnified Person to make a claim relating to a
breach of such Fundamental Representation, as the case may be, whichever is
later), for claims against an Indemnifying Person that seek recovery of
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with an
inaccuracy in such representations or warranties; _provided_ ,

 



58   _further_ , that no right to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(a)_ in respect of any claim that is set forth in a Claim Certificate
delivered to an Indemnifying Person on or prior to the expiration of such
representations and warranties shall be affected by such expiration;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such expiration shall not affect the rights of
any Indemnified Person under this _Article IX_ or otherwise to seek recovery
of Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
any fraud.

 

(b) Following the Closing, all covenants, agreements and obligations of the
parties hereto shall expire and be of no further force or effect as of the
Closing, except to the extent such covenants, agreements and obligations are
to be performed on or after the Closing; _provided_ that no right to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article IX_ in respect of any claim based
upon any breach of a covenant, agreement or obligation delivered on or prior
to the expiration of such covenant, agreement or obligation shall be affected
by the expiration of such covenant, agreement or obligation.

 

(c) Each of the respective survival periods described in _Section_ __ _
9.1(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_, as applicable, is individually referred
to in this Agreement as a " _Survival Period_. It is the express intent of the
parties hereto that, if a Survival Period is shorter than the statute
of limitations that would otherwise have been applicable to such
representation, warranty or covenant, then, by contract, such statute of
limitations shall be reduced to the shortened Survival Period. The parties
hereto further acknowledge that such Survival Periods are the result of
arms-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for such
Survival Periods to be enforced as agreed by them.

 

Section 9.2. _Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit the Indemnity Escrow Amount with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_ (the aggregate amount
of cash held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, from
time to time, the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ "), which Indemnity Escrow
Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, the Indemnity Escrow Fund
shall constitute partial security for the benefit of Buyer (on behalf of
itself or any other Indemnified Person) with respect to any Indemnifiable
Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations of Seller under this
_Article IX_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, the Escrow Agent shall hold
the Indemnity Escrow Fund until 11:59 p.m. local time on the date (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Release Date_ ") that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date. Neither the Indemnity Escrow Fund (including any portion
thereof) nor any beneficial interest therein may be pledged, subjected to any
Lien, sold, assigned or transferred by Seller or be taken or reached by any
legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other Liability of
Seller, in each case prior to the distribution of the Indemnity Escrow Fund
to Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_.

 

(b) Promptly following the Indemnity Escrow Release Date (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Escrow Agent shall
distribute to Seller any remaining amount in the Indemnity Escrow Fund less
that portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the aggregate value of all
unsatisfied or disputed Indemnifiable Damages set forth in any Claim
Certificate delivered to Seller on or prior to the Indemnity Escrow Release
Date in accordance with this _Article IX_ (which disputed amounts shall remain
in escrow and shall only be released to Seller following the Indemnity
Escrow Release Date upon final determination in Sellers favor with respect
to such disputed Indemnifiable Damages until such dispute is resolved). Any
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent following the
Indemnity Escrow Release Date with respect to pending but unresolved claims
for indemnification that is not awarded to Buyer upon the resolution of such
claims shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to Seller within five (5)
Business Days following resolution of such claims.

 



59 Section 9.3. _Indemnification of the Buyer Indemnified Persons_.

shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Company and their respective
officers, directors, agents and employees (each, a " _Buyer Indemnified
Person_ ") from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse each Buyer
Indemnified Person for, any and all losses, Liabilities, damages, claims,
fees, Taxes, interest, costs and expenses, including costs of investigation

the Company or Seller herein or in in any certificate delivered by the
Company or Seller to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(c)_ of this
Agreement;

 

(ii) any breach of, or default in connection with, any of the covenants,
agreements or obligations herein that are made by Seller or, solely with

to _Sections 6.3(a)_ ,  _(e)_ and _(f)_ ;

(vii) any Liabilities for claims, counterclaims, causes of action
or demands arising out of or relating to Sellers prior relationship with the
Company or its rights or status as a shareholder of the Company (excluding any
such Liabilities arising under this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, that
certain Agency Agreement, dated June 28, 2017, between the Company and the
ESOP Trustee, that certain Custody Agreement, dated June 28, 2017, between the
Company and the ESOP Trustee, or the Lifetouch Inc. Employee Stock Ownership

(viii) the matter set forth on _Schedule 9.3(a)(viii)_ to the extent such
matter has not been settled by the Company prior to the Closing; and

 

(ix) the matter set forth on _Schedule 9.3(a)(ix)_.

 

(b) Materiality qualifications and qualifications by reference to the
defined term "Material Adverse Effect" in any representation or warranty
herein made by any party hereto shall not be taken into account in determining
whether an inaccuracy in such representation or warranty exists for purposes
of _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)(i)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(i)_ or in
determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages with respect to such
inaccuracy; _provided_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_ shall not apply to
materiality qualifications set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ and _Section_ __
_ 3.16(a)_. Materiality qualifications and qualifications by reference to the
defined term "Material Adverse Effect" in any covenant, agreement
or obligation of any party herein shall be taken into account in determining
whether a breach thereof has occurred, but shall not be taken into account in
determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages with respect to any breach
of such covenant, agreement or obligation by any party hereto.

 



60 Section 9.4. _Indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Persons_.

(a) Subject to the limitations contained in this _Article IX_ , Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its officers, directors, agents,

agreements or obligations made by Buyer herein; and

(iii) any fraud by or on behalf of Buyer or, after the Closing, the
Company. 

Section 9.5. _Limitations on Indemnification; Source of Recovery_.

 

(a) _Deductible_.

 

(i) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
Buyer Indemnified Person with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages from any
claim or claims made by a Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(a)_, except to the extent that the aggregate Indemnifiable Damages from
all such claims exceeds $4,125,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the
Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover only such Indemnifiable
Damages as exceed such amount. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the limitation contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)(i)_
shall not apply to claims based on inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the
Company Fundamental Representations, or claims based on any matter set forth
in _Sections 9.3(a)(ii)_  through _(ix)_.

(ii) Buyer shall not be obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless
any Seller Indemnified Person with respect to any Indemnifiable Damages from
any claim or claims made by a Seller Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.4(a)_, except to the extent that the aggregate Indemnifiable Damages
from all such claims exceeds the Deductible, in which case the Seller
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover only such Indemnifiable
Damages as exceed such amount. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the limitation contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)(ii)_
shall not apply to claims based on inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the
Buyer Fundamental Representations, or claims based on any matter set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(ii)_ or _(iii)_.

(b) _Cap_.

 

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_, in no
event shall Sellers liability for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ exceed, in the aggregate, the Indemnity Escrow Amount
(the " _Cap_ "), except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c_); _provided_
, that Sellers liability for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(a)(viii)_ shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the Special Indemnity Cap.

 

(ii) In no event shall Buyers liability for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)_ exceed, in the aggregate, the Cap.

 



61 (c) _Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the limitations contained in _Sections 9.4(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(d)_ shall not
apply in the case of fraud.

 

(d) _Source of Recovery_. If there is determined to be any amount owing to
a Buyer Indemnified Person as a result of indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)(i)_, such amount shall first be paid and satisfied from
an amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal, in the aggregate, to the
Deductible, in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and,
following such time as the Retention Amount (as defined in the RandW Insurance
Policy) has been met, then such Buyer Indemnified Person may recover such
amount exclusively from the RandW Insurance Policy, regardless of any amount
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. If there is determined to be any
amount owing to a Buyer Indemnified Person as a result of indemnification
pursuant to _Sections 9.3(a)(ii)_ through _(ix)_ , such amount shall be
paid and satisfied exclusively from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance
with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , that Sellers
liability for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(a)(viii)_ shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund equal to the Special Indemnity Cap. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, including this _Article
IX_ , Buyer acknowledges, understands and agrees that, except as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ and subject to the additional limitations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, (i) any and all amounts payable by Seller as a
result of any claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person for indemnification
pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be paid solely out of and to the extent of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) for
Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)(i)_ in amounts in
excess of an amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the Deductible, the
sole source of recovery of the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Indemnifiable
Damages in this Agreement shall be the RandW Insurance Policy.

(e) Seller shall not be liable under this _Article IX_ for
any Indemnifiable Damages to the extent such Indemnifiable Damages are
reflected in the calculation of, or any adjustment to, Net Working Capital,
Transaction Expenses, Closing Cash or Closing Indebtedness, and no Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to recover more than once from an Indemnifying
Person for matters based on the same inaccuracy or breach.

(f) Buyer and Seller agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to treat)
any indemnification payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Aggregate Consideration. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall (nor shall they permit
their Affiliates to) take any position on any Tax Return, or before any
Governmental Entity involved in the administration of Tax Laws, that is
inconsistent with such treatment. Any indemnification obligation under this
Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds or any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnified Person or
its Affiliates from any third party with respect thereto, net of any
reasonable expenses and costs of recovery. In the event that an insurance or
other recovery (including recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy) is
received by or made available to any Indemnified Person with respect to any
indemnification obligation for which any such Person has been indemnified
under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery (net of any reasonable expenses and costs of recovery) shall be made
promptly to the Indemnifying Person.

 

Section 9.6. _Period for Claims_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 9.6, the period (the " _Claims Period_ ") during which claims may be
made against the Indemnity Escrow Fund for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to
Section 9.3(a) shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m. local
time on the Indemnity Escrow Release Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Claims Period for claims for Indemnifiable
Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct shall not be limited.

 



62 Section 9.7. _Claim Notice_.

 

(a) From time to time during the Claims Period, an Indemnified Person may
deliver to an Indemnifying Person one or more certificates signed by any
officer of the Indemnified Person (each, a " _Claim_ _Certificate_ "):

 

(i) stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or
accrued, or in good faith believes that it may incur, pay, reserve or accrue,
Indemnifiable Damages (or that with respect to any Tax matters, that any Tax
authority may reasonably raise such matter in audit of Buyer or its
subsidiaries, that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Indemnifiable
Damages);

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case
of Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be
the maximum amount believed by Buyer in good faith to be incurred, paid,
reserved, accrued or demanded by a third party); and

 

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Buyer) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such
Indemnifiable Damages are related.

 

(b) Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such officer of the Indemnified Person as of the date thereof,
(ii) shall not limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person
with respect to the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth
in such Claim Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to
time by the Indemnified Person by delivering any updated or amended Claim
Certificate, so long as the delivery of the original Claim Certificate is made
within the applicable Claims Period and such update or amendment relates to
the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such original
Claims Certificate; _provided_ that all claims for Indemnifiable Damages
properly set forth in a Claim Certificate or any update or amendment thereto
shall remain outstanding until such claims have been resolved or satisfied,
notwithstanding the expiration of such Claims Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no delay in providing such Claim Certificate within the applicable
Claims Period shall affect an Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless
(and then only to the extent that) Seller is materially prejudiced thereby.

 

Section 9.8. _Resolution of Direct Claims_. In the event of a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement other than a Third-Party Claim:

(a) If an Indemnifying Person does not contest, by written notice to
the Indemnified Party any claim or claims by the Indemnified Person made in
any Claim Certificate within the thirty (30)-day period following receipt of
the Claim Certificate, then (i) the Indemnifiable Damages identified in the
Claim Certificate will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Person, (ii) in the case of claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person, the Escrow
Agent shall, upon Buyers direction, distribute to Buyer an amount of cash
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund having a total value equal to the amount of
such Indemnifiable Damages set forth in such Claim Certificate, and (iii) in
the case of a claim by a Seller Indemnified Person, Buyer shall pay, by
wire transfer to an account designated by Seller, within two (2) Business
Days after the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period, the amount of cash
equal to such Indemnifiable Damages.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Person objects in writing to any claim or claims by
an Indemnified Person made in any Claim Certificate within the thirty
(30)-day period set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.8(a)_, Buyer and Seller shall
attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days after the Indemnified
Persons receipt of such written objection to resolve such objection. In the
case of claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person, if Buyer and Seller shall so
agree, a joint written instruction setting forth such agreement shall be 

 



63  prepared, signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent. Upon
receipt of such instruction, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Buyer an
amount of cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of
such joint written instruction. In the case of a claim by a Seller Indemnified
Person, Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer to an account designated by Seller,
within two (2) Business Days of such resolution, the amount of cash equal to
the amount so agreed.

(c) If no such agreement can be reached during the thirty (30)-day period
for good faith negotiation set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_, but in any
event upon the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period, either Buyer or
Seller may bring an action in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _
10.5_ to resolve the matter. The decision of such tribunal as to the validity
and amount of any claim in such Claim Certificate shall be non-appealable,
binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto, and, in the case of claim by a
Buyer Indemnified Person, Buyer shall be entitled to instruct the Escrow Agent
to distribute to Buyer an amount of cash from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance therewith. In the case of a claim by a Seller Indemnified Person,
Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer to an account designated by Seller, within
two (2) Business Days of such decision, the amount of cash in accordance with
such decision.

(d) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, in any suit hereunder in
which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Claim Certificate is at
issue, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to be the prevailing party
unless the arbitrator determines in favor of the Indemnifying Person with
respect to more than one-half of the amount in dispute, in which case the
Indemnifying Person shall be deemed to be the prevailing party. The non-
prevailing party to a tribunal shall pay its own fees and expenses and the
fees and expenses of the prevailing party, including attorneys fees and
costs, reasonably incurred in connection with such suit.

 

Section 9.9. _Resolution of Third-Party Claims_. In the event an
Indemnified Person becomes aware of a claim by a third party (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ ") that the Indemnified Person in good faith believes may result
in a claim for Indemnifiable Damages by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person, following delivery of a Claim Certificate to the Indemnifying Person,
the Indemnified Person shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct
the defense of and to settle or resolve such Third-Party Claim (and the costs
and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with
such defense, settlement or resolution (including reasonable attorneys fees,
other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall
be included in the Indemnifiable Damages for which the Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to receive indemnification pursuant to a claim made
hereunder, and such costs and expenses shall constitute Indemnifiable Damages
subject to indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ or  _Section_ __ _
9.4_, as applicable, in the event it is ultimately determined that any aspect
of such Third-Party Claim resulted in Indemnifiable Damages in connection with
a matter listed in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, as
applicable), and shall actively and diligently defend such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Person shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim
to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege
relating to any Indemnified Person, subject to execution by the Indemnifying
Person of the Indemnified Persons (and, if required, such third partys)
standard non-disclosure agreement to the extent that such materials contain
confidential or propriety information. However, the Indemnified Person shall
have the right in its sole discretion to determine and conduct the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and the settlement, adjustment or compromise of such
Third-Party Claim. Unless otherwise consented to in writing in advance by the
Indemnified Person in its sole discretion, the Indemnifying Person and its
Affiliates may not participate in any Third-Party Claim or any action related
to such Third-Party Claim (including any discussions or negotiations in
connection with the settlement, adjustment or compromise thereof). In the
event that an Indemnifying Party has consented to the amount of any
settlement or resolution by an Indemnified Party of any such claim (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), or if the Indemnifying
Party shall have been determined to have unreasonably withheld or delayed its
consent to the amount of any such settlement or resolution, the Indemnifying
Party shall not have any power or

 



64  authority to object under this _Article IX_ to the amount of any claim by or
on behalf of any Indemnified Person for indemnity with respect to such
settlement or resolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no settlement or
resolution by the Indemnified Person of any such Third-Party Claim shall be
determinative of the existence of the right of an Indemnified Person to be
indemnified in respect of such Third-Party Claim pursuant to this  _Article
IX_ or the amount of Indemnifiable Damages relating to such matter.

Section 9.10. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Buyer and Seller
agree to treat (and cause their respective Affiliates to treat) any payment
received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Article IX_ as
adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration for all Tax purposes to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 9.11. _Sole Remedy after Closing_. Each of Buyer and Seller
acknowledge and agree that, if the Closing occurs, their respective sole and
exclusive remedy following the Closing with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the other party hereto,
and with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement (excluding (a) any claim relating to fraud, or (b) any Post-Closing
Adjustment contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_), shall be pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained herein shall prevent the Indemnified Person from (x)
pursuing remedies as may be available to such party under applicable Law in
the event of the Indemnifying Persons failure to comply with its
indemnification obligations hereunder or (y) pursuing an injunction or other
equitable relief as may be available to such party under applicable Law or
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.14_.

Section 10.2. _Entire Agreement; Amendment; Assignment_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits hereto and the

hereof.

(b) This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified
except by an instrument in writing executed by the Company, Seller and Buyer.
No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this

65 Section 10.3. _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to
any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The rights and remedies of the parties
to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor
any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a
waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further
exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) no

applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given and (c) no

ANY FEDERAL OR STATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION SITTING IN THE COUNTY OF
NEW CASTLE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

Section 10.6. _Divisions and Headings_. The division of this Agreement
into sections and subsections and the use of captions and headings in
connection therewith are solely for convenience and shall have no legal effect
in construing the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.7. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is

shall be deemed to be their original signatures for any purposes whatsoever.

 



68 Section 10.10. _Interpretation_.

 

(a) The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and article,
section, paragraph, exhibit and schedule references are to the articles,
sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the
defined meanings contained herein when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto, unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms. All pronouns contained in this
Agreement encompass the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter
genders of such terms. Any Contract, instrument or Law defined or referred to
herein or in any Contract or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Contract, instrument or Law, as from time to time, amended, qualified or
supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts and instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of Laws) by succession of comparable successor
Laws and all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.
References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The
reference to "$" or "Dollars" shall be United States Dollars. The phrase
"made available to" and phrases of similar import means, with respect to any
information, document or other material of the Company, that such
information, document or material was made available for review by the
Company or its Representatives in the virtual data room established by the
Company in connection with this Agreement at least 48 hours prior to the
execution of this Agreement or actually delivered (whether by physical or
electronic delivery) to the Company or its Representatives at least 48 hours
prior to the execution of this Agreement.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement. The language used in this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any party.

(c) The Disclosure Schedule shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Agreement, to the same extent as if it were set forth verbatim
herein. Information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule specifically refers
to the article and section of this Agreement to which such information is
responsive; _provided_ , that, disclosure of an item in the Disclosure
Schedule in response to one section of this Agreement shall constitute
disclosure and response in the Disclosure Schedule to every section of this
Agreement to which its application is reasonably apparent from a reading of
the disclosure, notwithstanding the fact that no express cross-reference is
made. The Disclosure Schedule is not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, any representation or warranty or covenant of
Seller, except as and to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement.
Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Inclusion of a matter
in the Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an
admission by Seller, or otherwise imply, that any such matter is material or
creates a measure for materiality for purposes of this Agreement or of any
obligation or liability to any third party.

 

Section 10.11. _Time of Essence_. The parties hereby expressly acknowledge
and agree that time is of the essence for each and every provision of this
Agreement.

 



69 Section 10.12. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall treat all nonpublic information provided or
obtained in connection with this Agreement (including in connection with the
access provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ hereof) and the transactions
contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby incorporated by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of
this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
will govern. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect.

 

(b) After the Closing:

 

(i) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not disclose or use, directly or
indirectly, any information, whether disclosed through documents, work papers
or other materials, orally, or electronically, that is of a confidential or
proprietary nature related to Seller (including any information obtained in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) and shall maintain the
confidentiality of all such information; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
may disclose any such information (A) that is or becomes generally available
to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Buyer or its
Affiliates, (B) that is or becomes available to Buyer on a non-confidential
basis from a source that is not bound by a confidentiality obligation to the
Company or Seller, or (C) with the prior written approval of Seller;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, to the extent that Buyer or its Affiliates may
become legally compelled to disclose any such information by any Governmental
Entity or if Buyer or its Affiliates receives written advice of outside
counsel that disclosure is required in order to avoid violating any Laws,
Buyer or its Affiliates may disclose such information; but only after, if
applicable or relevant, they have used all commercially reasonable efforts
to afford Seller, at its sole cost and expense, the opportunity to obtain an
appropriate protective order, or other satisfactory assurance of confidential
treatment, for the information required to be disclosed; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Buyer may disclose only that portion of such information as
is necessary to comply with applicable Law or regulation, or to enforce its
obligations under this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_ shall not prohibit or restrict or otherwise limit the
use or disclosure by Buyer and its Affiliates of any documents, work papers or
other materials or information related to the Group Companies or
the Business.

(ii) Seller shall not disclose or use, directly or indirectly, any
information, whether disclosed through documents, work papers or other
materials, orally, or electronically, that is of a confidential or proprietary
nature related to the Group Companies and shall maintain the confidentiality
of all such information; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller may disclose
any such information (A) that is or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by Seller, (B) that is or becomes
available to Seller on a non-confidential basis from a source that is not
bound by a confidentiality obligation to Buyer or (C) with the prior written
approval of Buyer; _provided_ , _further_ , that, to the extent that
Seller may become legally compelled to disclose any such information by any
Governmental Entity or if Seller receives written advice of outside counsel
that disclosure is required in order to avoid violating any Laws, Seller may
disclose such information; but only after, if applicable or relevant, it has
used all commercially reasonable efforts to afford Buyer, at its sole cost and
expense, the opportunity to obtain an appropriate protective order, or other
satisfactory assurance of confidential treatment, for the information
required to be disclosed; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller may
disclose only that portion of such information as is necessary to comply with
applicable Law or regulation, in connection with any required Tax disclosures
or to enforce its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 10.13. _[Reserved]_. __  

 



70 Section 10.14. _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the subject matter of this Agreement, including
the business, assets and properties of the Group Companies, is unique, that
the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached, and that the remedies at law would
not be adequate to compensate such other parties not in default or in breach.
Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that the other parties will be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to
which they may be entitled, at law or in equity. The parties waive any defense
that a remedy at law is adequate and any requirement to post bond or provide
similar security in connection with actions instituted for injunctive relief
or specific performance of this Agreement.

Section 10.15. _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto on behalf of itself and
each of its Affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any Legal Proceeding, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving
the Financing Sources, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or any of the agreements (including the Commitment Letter)
entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so long as such forum is and
remains available, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto
irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees that any
such Legal Proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result in
the application of the laws of another state), (c) agrees not to bring or
support or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any
Legal Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in
any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or the performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than any
federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d)
agrees that service of process upon such party in any such Proceeding or
proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
10.4, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do
so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
Proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any
Legal Proceeding brought against the Financing Sources in any way arising out
of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Commitment Letter
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance
of any services thereunder, (g) agrees that none of the Financing Sources
will have any liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives any of their respective
current, former or future officers, directors, employees, agents,
representatives, stockholders, limited partners, managers, members or
partners relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder and (h) agrees that the Financing
Sources are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the
