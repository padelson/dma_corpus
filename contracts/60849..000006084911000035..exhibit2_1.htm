as of the Closing Date as well as a schedule of the finalized Capital

Statement in good faith and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. An

Statement, Seller and its representatives shall be permitted, upon reasonable
notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to review, copy and
inspect Seller's, the Acquired Companies' and their Subsidiaries' books and
records, work papers, schedules and other supporting papers related to the
preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement.
Prior to the delivery of any Dispute Notice, Seller and its representatives
may make reasonable inquiries of Buyer, Acquired Companies and their
representatives regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Statement arising in the
course of their review thereof, and Buyer shall use its, and shall cause
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries to use their, commercially

Buyer, a written notice of disagreement (a "Dispute Notice") with respect to
any components or values stated in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Closing Date Statement, as applicable, specifying in reasonable detail the
nature and extent of such disagreement, in which case the disagreement shall
be resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.8(d). If Seller
does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Buyer within the applicable thirty (30)

the Closing Date Statement, as applicable, as delivered to Seller, shall be
deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Seller, and shall be final and
binding on the Parties.

  

  

(b) Net Working Capital Adjustment. If the Net Working Capital Amount as

Amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, within

that such dispute be submitted to the Neutral Auditor. The Neutral Auditor
shall act as an arbitrator to determine and resolve only those issues still in
dispute based solely on the presentations by Seller and Buyer. The Neutral
Auditor's resolution of such dispute (i) shall be made as soon as practicable
but no later than forty-five (45) days after the submission of the dispute,
based solely on the presentations by Buyer and Seller, (ii) shall be in
accordance with this Agreement, (iii) shall be effected in a manner that is
consistent with GAAP consistently applied, (iv) shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to Seller and Buyer and (v) shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer, except for fraud or manifest
error, and judgment may be entered on such decision in a court of competent
jurisdiction. In connection with the resolution of any dispute, the
Neutral Auditor shall have access to all documents, records, work papers,
facilities and personnel necessary to perform its function as arbitrator. To
the extent not otherwise provided herein, the commercial arbitration rules
adopted by the AAMS as in effect at the time of any arbitration shall govern
such arbitration in all respects. The arbitration under this Section 2.8(e)
will take place in Calgary, Alberta. Each Party shall bear its own fees and
expenses with respect to any proceeding under this Section 2.8(e); provided,
however, that the fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor shall be allocated
to and paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and/or Seller, on the other hand, based
upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party, as determined
by the Neutral Auditor.

  

  

Section 2.9 Escrow.

  

  

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit the Deferred Portion of the
Initial Purchase Price with the Escrow Agent as provided in Section
2.7(a)(iii). Of such amount, an amount equal to $15,000,000 (such cash,
together with all dividends, distributions and interest thereon from and after
the Closing Date), is referred to as the "Indemnity Escrow Fund," and an
amount equal to $5,000,000 (such cash, together with all dividends,
distributions and interest thereon from and after the Closing Date) is
referred to as the "Supply Escrow Fund." The Indemnity Escrow Fund
constitutes the security for the payment of any Final Adjustment Amount owing
by Seller under Section 2.8(d) and the payment or performance of the
obligations of Seller under Section 6.5 and Article VIII, except for clause
(d) of Section 8.2. The Supply Escrow Fund constitutes the security for the
payment or performance of the obligations of Seller under clause (d) of
Section 8.2.

  

  

(b) The Escrow Amount shall be paid as provided in Section 2.8(d), Section 6.5
and Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement; provided, that (i) any amounts
remaining in the Supply Escrow Fund less any Disputed Claim Amounts and (ii)
any amounts remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund less any Disputed Claim
Amounts shall be released to Seller on the first Business Day that is 18
months after the Closing Date (the "Escrow Release Date").

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if on or prior
to the Escrow Release Date any claim or claims have been made by Buyer
pursuant to Section 6.5 and Article VIII that have not been finally resolved
by such date, a portion of the Escrow Amount in an amount equal to the amount
of such claims shall continue to be held in escrow (the "Disputed Claim
Amounts") and shall be released with respect to each such claim once such
claim has been finally resolved in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(d) Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other, shall be
responsible for one-half of all fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(e) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, Buyer shall be the owner of the
Escrow Amount for federal income tax reporting purposes.

  

  

Section 2.10 Purchase Price Allocation.

  

  

Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities shall
be allocated among the Purchased Assets and covenants herein in the manner
mutually agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller Representative (the
"Allocation"), which Allocation is in accordance with the Tax Act and Section
1060 of the Code and the respective regulations thereunder and which
Allocation shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller Representative on or prior
to the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Allocation is subject to any
adjustments reasonably required by Buyer's auditors to comply with the Tax Act
and the Code and the respective regulations thereunder or as a result of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Date Statement or the Capital
Expenditures Statement; provided, further, that any such adjustment shall be
made within thirty (30) days after the delivery of such items. Subject to any
adjustments set forth in the preceding sentence, the Allocation shall control
for all purposes (including financial reporting and Tax purposes), and neither
Buyer nor Seller shall take any position for purposes of any federal, state
provincial or local income tax with respect to the allocation of the Purchase
Price that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, in each case,
unless required to do so by a final determination made by the IRS or a court,
or as defined in the Tax Act. Each of Buyer and Seller Representative agree to
promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to the Allocation. Consistent with the Tax
Act and Section 1060 of the Code, the Allocation shall specify a maximum
amount of the Purchase Price to be allocated to the Equity Interests.

Order applicable to each of Seller and Quinn Holdings or by which any of the

practice and, except as reserved against on the Most Recent Balance Sheet,
which reserves were calculated in a manner consistent with past practice and
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, are good and collectible at the
aggregate recorded amounts thereof and constitute only valid, undisputed
claims of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries not subject
to valid claims of set-off or other defenses or counterclaims. Except as set
forth in Section 4.5 of the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Accounts
Receivables represent obligations for goods sold on consignment, on approval

arrangement. All accounts payable of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their

2009, and the related statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the fiscal years then ended (the "Annual Financial Statements") and

and the related statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
the four months then ended (the financial statements described in clauses (i)
and (ii) above are collectively referred to as the "Financial Statements").
Except as noted in Section 4.6 of the Disclosure Schedule or in the Financial
Statements and the footnotes thereto, and except in the case of the Most
Recent Balance Sheet and the related Financial Statements for normal year-end
adjustments that are not material in amount in the case of any unaudited
interim financial statements, each of the Financial Statements are complete
and correct in all material respects, were prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied by the Acquired Companies without modification of the
accounting principles used in the preparation thereof throughout the periods
presented and presents and present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial condition of the Acquired Companies at the respective dates thereof
and for the periods indicated therein.

  

  

Section 4.7 Inventory.

  

  

The inventories of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries
(including raw materials, supplies, work-in-process, finished goods and other
materials) (i) are in good, merchantable and useable condition and (ii) are of
a quality and quantity and, with respect to finished goods, saleable, in the
Ordinary Course of Business except for obsolete items and items of below-
standard quality, all of which have been written off or written down to the

Financial Statements, including the Most Recent Balance Sheet, or on the
accounting records of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries as

4.7(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. Seller, the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries are not in possession of any inventory not owned by Seller, the
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries, including goods already sold.
Inventories now on hand that were purchased after the date of the Annual
Financial Statements or the Most Recent Balance Sheet were purchased in the
Ordinary Course of Business of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries at a cost not exceeding market prices prevailing at the time of
purchase. The quantities of each item of inventories (whether raw materials,
supplies, work-in-process, finished goods and other materials) are reasonable
in the present circumstances of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries. Work-in-process inventories are now valued, and will be valued
on the Closing Date, according to GAAP, consistently applied. Section 4.7(b)
of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of places where material
inventories of Seller, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries were
located as of August 31, 2011.

  

  

Section 4.8 Real Property.

  

  

(a) Section 4.8(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all real property and
interests in real property, including improvements thereon and easements
appurtenant thereto, owned in fee simple by Quinn Holdings, Seller, the
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real Property," except
that such term does not include the 52nd Avenue Real Property) and all real
property leased by Seller, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries (the
"Leased Real Property," and together with the Owned Real Property, the "Real
Property"). Quinn Holdings, Seller, the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible title to the Owned Real Property and,
as the case may be, subsisting leasehold interests in the Leased Real Property
(subject in each case to the terms of the applicable leases, subleases and
related instruments governing Seller's or the Acquired Companies' interests
therein), free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. The leases and subleases related to the Leased Real Property are
valid and subsisting leases or subleases, which are in full force and effect
and binding upon the landlords or sublandlords thereunder, and none of Seller,
the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries has received any notice that it
has breached, violated or defaulted under any of such leases, subleases or
contracts. Seller and the Acquired Companies are the tenant, occupant or
possessor in good-standing under the applicable leases, subleases and related
instruments governing Seller's and such Acquired Company's interests in the
Leased Real Property. To the Knowledge of Seller and the Acquired Companies,
there is no event, occurrence, condition or act which, with the giving of
notice or the passage of time or both, or in conjunction with the happening of
any other event or condition, could reasonably be expected to become a
material default or event of default under any such existing leases or
subleases. Seller and each Acquired Company is in peaceful and undisturbed
possession of the space and/or estate under each lease or sublease of which
Seller and such Acquired Company is a tenant. None of Quinn Holdings, Seller
or the Acquired Companies has received any written notice of any
expropriation, appropriation, condemnation or like proceeding or of any
violation of any applicable zoning or similar law relating to or affecting the
Owned Real Property, and, to the Knowledge of Quinn Holdings, Seller and the
Acquired Companies, no such proceeding has been threatened or commenced. None
of the improvements located on the Owned Real Property constitute a legal non-
conforming use or otherwise require any special dispensation, variance or
special permit under any Legal Requirements. All buildings, structures,
improvements, fixtures and building systems, and all components thereof,
included in the Owned Real Property are, to the Knowledge of Quinn Holdings,
Seller and the Acquired Companies, in good condition and repair and are not
subject to any structural deficiencies or latent defects and are situated
entirely within the boundaries of the Owned Real Property without encroachment
on any adjoining real property. Quinn Holdings, Seller or the Acquired
Companies have delivered or made available to Buyer true, correct and complete
copies of all deeds, certificates of title, title reports and surveys for the
Owned Real Property in the possession, custody or control of Quinn Holdings,
Seller or the Acquired Companies. Quinn Holdings, Seller or the Acquired
Companies have delivered true, correct and complete copies to Buyer of all
leases, subleases and related instruments governing the Acquired Companies'
interests in the Leased Real Property.

  

  

(b) Except as set forth on Section 4.8(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, all
buildings, fixtures and improvements on the Real Property that are material to
the operation of the Business (i) are in good operating condition, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, and to the Knowledge of Quinn Holdings, Seller and the
Acquired Companies, without structural defects, and, to the Knowledge of Quinn
Holdings, Seller and the Acquired Companies, all mechanical and other systems
located thereon are in good operating condition, ordinary wear and tear
excepted, and no condition exists requiring material repairs, alterations or
corrections and (ii) are suitable, sufficient and appropriate in all respects
for their current and contemplated uses. To the Knowledge of Quinn Holdings,

Section 5.8 Financing.

  

  

Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies and each Subsidiary of an
Acquired Company to, provide Buyer and its representatives and advisors with
all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer that is necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with arranging for financing for a portion of the
Purchase Price (the "Financing"), including: (i) participating in meetings,
presentations and due diligence sessions with potential lenders; (ii)
facilitating field audits and other reviews of the Acquired Companies and
their Subsidiaries by potential lenders; (iii) providing potential lenders
with such financial and other pertinent information regarding the Acquired
Companies and their Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested; (iv)
allowing Buyer and potential lenders to use the names of the Acquired
Companies and their Subsidiaries in connection with the marketing or
syndication of the Financing, (v) executing effective as of the Closing Date
such agreements, guarantees, security agreements and other instruments as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer or any lender or lenders providing the
Financing; (vi) executing and delivering customary certificates to the lender
or lenders on the Closing Date; and (vii) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by Buyer or any
lender or lenders providing the Financing to permit the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller affirms that it is a condition to the
Closing that Buyer obtain the Financing on terms satisfactory to Buyer. In
the event that Buyer determines the Financing is not available on satisfactory
terms, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of such determination (a "Financing
Notice") and Seller may elect to terminate this Agreement as provided in
Section 9.1(c)(ii).

  

  

Section 5.9 280G Approval.

  

  

If necessary, prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall submit
to their shareholders for approval by such number of shareholders as is
required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments or
benefits that would separately or in the aggregate constitute "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder), such that such payments and benefits shall not be
deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code. If necessary,
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer evidence that (i) a
shareholder vote was held in conformity with Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite shareholder approval was
obtained with respect to any payments or benefits that were subject to the
shareholder vote (the "280G Approval"), (ii) the 280G Approval was not
obtained and as a consequence, that such "parachute payments" shall not be
made or provided and those individuals entitled to receive any such payment
shall have provided to Buyer waivers of those payments or benefits, or (iii)
the 280G Approval was not necessary because no payments or benefits would
constitute "parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) in the absence of the 280G
Approval.

  

  

Section 5.10 Grenco Energy Services Limited Partnership.

  

  

At or prior to the Closing, Quinn shall cause Quinn Canada to purchase all of
the equity interests or other ownership interests, including all securities
convertible into any such interests, of each of Grenco GP and Grenco not held
by Quinn or Quinn Canada (collectively, the "Minority Interests") on terms
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. Notwithstanding Section 2.7(b), in the event
Quinn Canada has not purchased all of the Minority Interests prior to the
Closing and Buyer elects to waive the condition set forth in Section 7.2(f),
the Initial Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the product
of (i) the amounts allocated to each of the Grenco GP and Grenco
Equity Interests in the Allocation and (ii) the percentage ownership interest
represented by such outstanding Minority Interests in each of Grenco GP and
Grenco not held by Quinn Canada.

  

  

Section 5.11 Updates to Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

Without limiting the generality of Section 5.3, Seller shall provide to Buyer
written updates to the Disclosure Schedule promptly upon becoming aware of
facts or circumstances that would cause any of the representations or
warranties of Quinn Holdings, Seller, any Acquired Company, or a Subsidiary of
such Acquired Company, as the case may be, in Section 3.1 or Article IV,
respectively, to be untrue or incomplete in any material respect. Seller may
not use the fact that it has provided updates to the Disclosure Schedule (or
the contents of such updates) as a basis for asserting that any of the closing
conditions in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b) and 7.2(c)(i) have been satisfied. If
Seller has provided updates to the Disclosure Schedule prior to the Closing
Date that establish that any of the closing conditions in Sections 7.2(a),
7.2(b) and 7.2(c)(i) have not been satisfied and Buyer elects to waive such
closing conditions and to proceed with Closing, then Buyer shall be precluded
after the Closing from using the contents of such updates as a basis for
asserting a claim for indemnification under Article VIII; in all other
circumstances, such updates from Seller shall have no impact under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if Closing would otherwise
occur at a time within three Business Days of the last update provided by
Seller under this Section 5.11, Buyer shall have the unilateral right to
extend Closing by not more than three Business Days after the date on which
Buyer last receives any such update, and, if such extension would cause
Closing to occur after the End Date, to extend the End Date by an equal
amount of time.

  

  

Section 5.12 Intentionally Omitted.

  

  

Section 5.13 Privacy.

  

  

(a) Except as set out in Section 5.13 of the Disclosure Schedule, Seller and
each of the Acquired Companies has complied at all times with all applicable
privacy laws in connection with Seller's and the Acquired Company's
collection, use and disclosure of personal information about any identifiable
individual ("Personal Information"); and all Personal Information has been
collected, used and disclosed with the consent of each individual to whom such
Personal Information relates and has been used only for the purposes for which
it was initially collected;

  

  

(b) Before Closing, Buyer shall not use any Personal Information disclosed by
any of the Acquired Companies or their representatives for any purposes other
than those related to the performance of this Agreement and the completion of
the transaction;

  

  

(c) Buyer, Seller and their respective representatives agree that only
Personal Information which is necessary for the parties to (i) determine
whether or not to proceed with this transaction, or (ii) carry out this
transaction, shall be exchanged between the parties; and

  

  

(d) Buyer, Seller and their respective representatives agree that if this
transaction is not completed, any Personal Information which was disclosed
will either be destroyed or returned to the party which disclosed the Personal
Information.

  

  

Section 5.14 Employees.

  

  

(a) General.

  

  

(i) At least 14 days prior to the Closing Date Seller shall issue notices of
termination to each of the Seller Employees effective and conditional on
Closing, and shall notify Buyer that the notices of termination have been
issued.

  

  

(ii) Following receipt of confirmation that the termination notices described
in Section 5.14(a)(i) have been issued and prior to Closing, Buyer will offer
in writing to hire all Seller Employees effective and conditional on Closing,
except as otherwise set forth in Section 5.14(a)(ii) of the Disclosure
Schedule, (any personnel employed in connection with the Business who do not
become employees of Buyer on the first Business Day after the Closing Date are
referred to as "Former Employees"), who are actively at work immediately prior
to the Closing Date and who report to work for Buyer on the first Business
Day after the Closing Date, at a job and rate of pay (including commission
structure) comparable in the aggregate to each such employee's job and pay
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 5.14(a) to the contrary, Buyer shall offer employment to any Seller
Employee who is on medical or other leave of absence on the Closing Date (an
"Inactive Employee") when such employee is fit to return to work. Inactive
Employees shall be included as Former Employees unless and until they become
Transferring Employees pursuant to the following sentence. Seller Employees
who are hired by Buyer and report to work for Buyer on the first Business Day
after the Closing Date (or, if they are Inactive Employees on the Closing
Date, when they are fit to return to work) and perform services for Buyer are
"Transferring Employees." Except as provided above with respect to Inactive
Employees, Former Employees shall not be included in the definition of
Transferring Employees hereunder. Buyer shall assume all employment-related
obligations with respect to the Transferring Employees accruing on or after
the Closing Date, and Seller shall retain all employment-related obligations
with respect to such Former Employees whenever incurred or accruing and with
respect to such Transferring Employees incurred, accruing or attributable to
claims incurred or events occurring before the Closing Date including bonuses
or other payments arising from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(iii) For purposes of this Section 5.14 and unless otherwise expressly
provided herein:

  

  

(A) "employment-related obligations" to be assumed by Buyer with respect to
Transferring Employees shall include compensation for services performed for
Buyer after the Closing Date (and related employment and withholding taxes),
any Buyer-sponsored "employee welfare benefit plan" or "employee pension
benefit plan" covering the Transferring Employees with respect to claims
incurred on or after the Closing Date, and benefits accrued under any other
unfunded employee benefit plan or arrangement of Buyer covering the
Transferring Employees on or after the Closing Date; and

  

  

(B) "employment-related obligations" to be assumed by Buyer shall not include
compensation (and related employment and withholding taxes) for services
performed for Seller before the Closing Date, benefits accrued or claims
incurred under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Seller covering the
Seller Employees or Former Employees prior to or after the Closing Date,
including any bonus, compensation or fringe benefits payable to any director,
officer, supervisor, manager or consultant of Seller.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, (i) Seller shall,
and Buyer shall not, be responsible for any employment-related obligations
with respect to any Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferring Employee for
any period prior to the date such individual becomes a Transferring Employee,
as the case may be, or with respect to Former Employees, (ii) Buyer shall have
no obligation to continue the employment of any Transferring Employee for any
definite period following the Closing Date, and (iii) Buyer shall not be
precluded from altering, amending or terminating at any time any of its
employee benefit plans, or the participation of any of its employees in such
plans or any plan of Seller that Buyer adopts in whole or in part at any
time.

  

  

(iv) Seller represents and warrants that Section 5.14(a)(iii) of the
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and correct list of all Employees,
together with their respective job titles, continuous service dates and hourly
rates or base salary, as appropriate, as of the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Seller Employees.

  

  

(i) "Past Service" means service with regard to the Business as a Seller
Employee.

  

  

(ii) Transferring Employees shall be eligible for participation in benefit
plans of Buyer as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion. Buyer will give
credit for Past Service for purposes of (x) participation in and eligibility
for benefits under the above-referenced plans or arrangements, and (y)
determining vacation under Buyer's vacation policy, and severance benefits, if
any.

  

  

(iii) Except as provided in Section 5.14(a), Buyer assumes no obligations
under any of Seller's Benefit Plans covering any Seller Employee or Former
Employee prior to or after the Closing Date. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 5.14, Transferring Employees shall be eligible to participate in the
Buyer's medical, benefits, disability or other similar plans ("Buyer's Benefit
Plans"), in accordance with the terms of such plans. Buyer shall not provide
benefit coverage to a Seller Employee or his or her dependents to the
extent that such person has not become an employee of, and performed services
for, Buyer. Buyer will make all commercially reasonable efforts to waive any
preexisting condition restrictions under the Buyer's Benefit Plans with
respect to Transferring Employees or their dependents. In particular, but
without limitation, (x) claims for medical, hospital or other health care
expenses incurred by Transferring Employees or their dependents on or after
the Closing Date shall be covered under the Buyer's Benefit Plans, subject to
the limitations thereof (but in accordance with the terms of this Agreement),
and claims for such expenses incurred by Transferring Employees or their
dependents prior to the Closing Date shall be covered, subject to the
limitations thereof (but in accordance with the terms of this Agreement),
under Seller's Benefit Plans; (y) claims of Transferring Employees or their
dependents for life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and
disability benefits with respect to death, disability or other injury
occurring on or after the Closing Date shall be covered under Buyer's Benefit
Plans; and (z) claims for such benefits with respect to death, disability or
injury occurring prior to the Closing Date shall be covered under Seller's
plans (as applicable). The amount and type of benefits payable in any case
shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable disability
or benefits plan.

  

  

(iv) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any
and all claims for severance with respect to Transferring Employees arising
out of Buyer's termination of a Transferring Employee after the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Cooperation. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and provide such information
as may reasonably be necessary with respect to each of the actions
contemplated in this Section 5.14.

  

  

(d) Obligations. It is intended by the Parties that the responsibilities,
liabilities, and covenants assumed or agreed to by Buyer pursuant to this
Section 5.14 shall also bind any Affiliate of Buyer to which all or any
portion of the Business is transferred.

  

  

(e) Reporting Requirements. Seller and Buyer shall each comply with their
respective reporting requirements attributable to wages paid or to be paid to
Transferring Employees.

  

  

(f) No Third Party Rights. No Transferring Employee or other Former Employee
or Seller Employee including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
other person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any
claim hereunder.

  

  

(g) Costs. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.14, where Section
5.14 requires a Party to take any action or perform any task, the Party
obligated to take such action or perform such task shall be responsible for
all fees, costs and other expenses incurred for, and related to, such actions
or tasks.

  

  

(h) Acquired Company Employees. Effective on the Closing Date and except as
otherwise set forth in Section 5.14(h) of the Disclosure Schedule, all of the
salaried and hourly personnel employed by an Acquired Company or a Subsidiary
of an Acquired Company shall continue to be employed by such Acquired Company
or Subsidiary at the same job and rate of pay (including commission structure)
applicable to each such employee's job and pay immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

  

  

Section 5.15 Risk of Loss.

  

  

Pending the Closing Date, possession of the Purchased Assets shall be retained
by Seller and Seller shall continue to carry on the Business for its own
benefit and at its own risk up to the Closing Date. The Purchased Assets shall
be at the risk of Buyer as of the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 5.16 Notices and Consents.

  

  

Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies and
their Subsidiaries to, give all required notices to those third parties, and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain those third party consents, that
are necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the items listed in Section 4.3 of
the Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

ARTICLE VI

  

  

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

  

  

The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the Closing.

  

  

Section 6.1 General.

  

  

In the event any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement at any time after the Closing, each of the Parties
will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party, unless the
requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article VIII
below. Seller acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing Buyer
will be entitled to possession of all documents, books, records (including Tax
records), agreements, and financial data of any sort relating to each of the
Acquired Companies. After Closing, Seller shall have access to all documents,
books, records (including Tax records), agreements, and financial data of any
sort relating to the pre-Closing period of each of the Acquired Companies at
its cost and expense, and such records shall not be destroyed prior to the
expiration of seven years following the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed
to by the Parties.

  

  

Section 6.2 Litigation Support.

  

  

In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or defending
against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge,
complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (i) any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date
involving Seller or an Acquired Company, each of the other Parties will
cooperate with him, her or it and his, her or its counsel in the contest or
defense, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony and access
to their books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Article VIII below); provided, however, that
Section 6.2 shall not apply to disputes between the Parties.

  

  

Section 6.3 Transition.

  

  

(a) Seller will not take any action that is designed or intended to have the
effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer, supplier, or other
business associate of an Acquired Company or a Subsidiary of an Acquired
Company from maintaining the same business relationships with such Acquired
Company or Subsidiary after the Closing as it maintained with such Acquired
Company or Subsidiary prior to the Closing. Seller will refer all customer
inquiries relating to the business of the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries to Buyer after the Closing.

  

  

(b) Seller agrees that Buyer shall have a reasonable period of time after
Closing to remove and relocate the Purchased Assets located at the 52nd Avenue
Real Property. During the pendency of such removal and relocation, Buyer and
its employees and representatives shall have access to and be permitted to
operate such Purchased Assets during normal business hours. Buyer and its
employees shall only be allowed ingress and egress to the location of such
Purchased Assets, shall not be authorized to enter other locations, shall not
be in operation or control of or related in any capacity with Seller's
employees at such location. Any matters arising during handling of such
Purchased Assets by Buyer's employees will be reported to Seller for its
attention.   

 

  

Section 6.4 Confidentiality.

  

  

Seller will treat and hold as such all of the Confidential Information, and
refrain from using any of the Confidential Information except in connection
with this Agreement, and after the Closing Date deliver promptly to Buyer or
destroy, at the request and option of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all
copies) of the Confidential Information which are in his, her or its
possession. In the event that Seller is requested or required (by oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, Seller will notify Buyer promptly of
the request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.4. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller is,
on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information
to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, Seller may disclose the
Confidential Information to the tribunal; provided, however, that Seller shall
use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request and
expense of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

  

  

Section 6.5 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Tax Returns. With the exception of income Tax Returns solely related to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period and due before Closing, Buyer shall control the
preparation of all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, provided, however, that Seller shall have
the right (prior to filing) to review and comment on each such material Tax
Return covering a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period (collectively,
"Pre-Closing Returns") and Buyer shall consider all such comments in good
faith. Buyer shall prepare such Pre-Closing Returns in a manner consistent
with past practice. Buyer may review any Tax Returns filed by any Acquired
Company or Seller for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in connection with the
preparation of such Pre-Closing Returns and Seller shall cooperate in
providing Buyer copies thereof. Buyer shall not amend any Pre-Closing Returns
without the written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except as may be required by law. With respect to income Tax Returns
solely related to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and due before Closing, Seller
shall control the preparation and filing of all such Tax Returns; provided,
however, that Buyer shall have the right (prior to filing) to review and
comment on each such Tax Return and Seller shall consider all such comments in
good faith.

  

  

(b) Cooperation. Each Party shall provide the other Party with such
cooperation and information as it reasonably may request with respect to the
Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries in filing any Tax Return, amending
any Tax Return, determining a liability for Taxes or participating in or
conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Each Party shall
bear its own expenses in complying with the foregoing provisions.

  

  

(c) Transfer and Similar Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid equally by Buyer and Seller when due, and
Buyer shall, at its expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by
applicable Legal Requirement, Seller, as the case may be, shall join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  

  

(d) Tax Indemnity. Seller, Quinn and Quinn Holdings shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Acquired Companies, their Subsidiaries and Buyer and
holder them harmless from and against all Damages arising from: (i) all Taxes
of Seller for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) all Taxes of each Acquired
Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (iii) all Taxes
of each Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to the portion of
the Straddle Period that ends on and includes the Closing Date, and (iv) all
Taxes resulting from a breach of any of the covenants, representations or
warranties contained in Sections 4.17, 5.2 and 6.5 hereof ("Tax Indemnity").
All indemnification claims made pursuant to this Section 6.5(d) shall be made
in accordance with the procedures of Section 8.5 and shall be subject to the
requirements set forth in Section 8.5. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tax
Indemnity provided in this Section 6.5(d) shall not be subject to any
limitations, Deductible or De Minimis Claims exception set forth in Section
8.4.

  

  

(e) Allocation of Tax Liabilities. For purposes of determining Tax liabilities
under this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that
relates to the portion of such Straddle Period that ends on and including the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income, gains, gross receipts, sales or use be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon
or related to income, gains, gross receipts, sales or use be deemed equal to
the amount that would be payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior
practice of the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries.

  

  

(f) Carrybacks. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
Buyer, each Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries may carry back, or cause or
permit such Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries to carry back, for Canadian,
United States federal, state, provincial, local or non-United States Tax
purposes to any taxable year or period thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date any operating losses, net operating losses, capital losses, Tax credits
or similar items arising in a taxable period (or a portion thereof) occurring
after the Closing Date to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements, except
to the extent that Seller would be materially adversely affected by such
carryback. Any refunds of Taxes resulting from such carryback shall be for the
benefit of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries, and Seller
shall have no entitlement thereto.

  

  

(g) Tax Elections. Without the prior written consent of Buyer, none of Seller,
any Acquired Company, any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company and any Affiliate
of Seller shall, to the extent it may affect or relate to any Acquired Company
or any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company, make or change any Tax election,
change any annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax
accounting, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement,
settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax
refund, offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension
or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment
or, if it would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing
any Tax Asset of any Acquired Company, any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company,
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, take or omit to take any other action outside
of the Ordinary Course of Business.

  

  

Section 6.6 Cessation of Use of Trade Names and Related Matters.

  

  

Seller agrees to: (a) promptly after the Closing Date change Seller's legal
name and trade name to a name that does not include the words "Quinn's
Oilfield Supply" or any variation thereof; and (b) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, discontinue, and cause their respective
Affiliates to discontinue, all use of the words "Quinn's Oilfield Supply,"
except as specifically permitted in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.7 Apportionment of Property Taxes; Utilities; Rents.

  

  

(a) All real property taxes, personal property taxes and similar obligations
("Property Taxes") attributable to the Purchased Assets with respect to a tax
period in which the Closing Date occurs shall be apportioned as of the Closing
Date between Seller or Quinn Holdings, as the case may be, and Buyer
determined by prorating such Property Taxes on a daily basis over the entire
tax period.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, when due, to the appropriate Taxing
Authorities all Property Taxes relating to the tax period during which the
Closing Date occurs. Buyer shall send to Seller Representative a statement
that apportions the Property Taxes between Seller or Quinn Holdings, as the
case may be, and Buyer based upon Property Taxes actually invoiced and paid to
the Taxing Authorities by Buyer for the tax year which includes the Closing
Date, with Seller or Quinn Holdings, as the case may be, being responsible for
the Property Taxes attributable to the period prior to and including the
Closing Date less the amount accrued for such taxes on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet. This statement shall be accompanied by proof of Buyer's actual
payment of such Property Taxes for such tax year. Within five days of receipt
of such statement and proof of payment, Seller or Quinn Holdings, as the case
may be, shall reimburse Buyer for its pro-rated portion of such Property
Taxes.

  

  

(c) To the extent utilities have not been placed in Buyer's name as of the
Closing Date, charges and credits for water, electricity, sewage, gas, and all
other utilities shall be adjusted and apportioned between Seller or Quinn
Holdings, as the case may be, and Buyer through the Closing Date. If Buyer
receives invoices for utilities for any period of time prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer will forward the invoices to Seller or Quinn Holdings, as the case
may be, for prompt payment. Likewise, if Seller or Quinn Holdings receives
invoices for utilities for any period of time on or after the Closing Date,
Seller or Quinn Holdings, as the case may be, will forward the invoices to
Buyer of such Purchased Assets for prompt payment.

  

  

(d) Regarding the Leased Real Property, where one of Seller, the Acquired
Companies or their Subsidiaries is a tenant under the applicable lease (each a
"Lease" and collectively, the "Leases"), all items of base rent, percentage
rent, and other charges paid or payable under the Leases shall be prorated at
the Closing effective as of the Closing Date. Seller shall be entitled to a
credit for any prepaid rent under such applicable Leases and any security
deposits paid by the applicable member of either Seller, the Acquired
Companies or their Subsidiaries under such applicable Leases (it being
agreed, however, that in such event, Buyer, the Acquired Company or its
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall be entitled to (or shall have the benefit of,
as applicable) any such prepaid rent and/or such security deposit under the
applicable Leases). Buyer shall be entitled to a similar credit from Seller
for any percentage rent it may pay for any of the Leases in the amount of the
portion of such percentage rent that is attributable to gross sales (or other
applicable measure, depending upon the Lease in question) generated on or
prior to the Closing Date. Within thirty (30) days after any such percentage
rent is actually paid, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of Seller's
proportionate part of the percentage rent and due from Seller. Seller shall
pay such amount within five (5) Business Days in immediately available funds
wired to Buyer's account.

  

  

Section 6.8 GST Election.

  

  

With respect to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets, Seller and
Buyer agree that, on the Closing Date, they shall jointly make an election
under Section 167 of the Excise Tax Act such that no Tax will be payable for
the sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to the GST Legislation. Should it be
determined by the appropriate Taxing Authority that the foregoing election is
not available to the parties for whatever reason, Buyer shall indemnify Seller
for any GST, penalty and interest that may be assessed against Seller. The
Parties agree that they shall forthwith jointly complete the required election
form(s) and attend to its/their filing on or forthwith after Closing.

  

  

Section 6.9 Supply Agreement.

  

  

In connection with the performance and delivery of Services (as such term is
defined in the Supply Agreement) pursuant to the Supply Agreement, Seller and
Buyer agree as follows:

  

  

(a) Improvements. Seller shall promptly disclose and irrevocably transfer,
convey and assign to Buyer all of its worldwide right, title, and interest in
and to any derivatives, enhancements, modifications, alterations or
improvements Seller conceives to any patent, patent application, technology,
trade secret, know-how or confidential information of Buyer disclosed by Buyer
to Seller during the term of the Supply Agreement, and/or any development,
design or Product form created in the course of performance of the Supply
Agreement (collectively, "Improvements") during the Term of the Supply
Agreement whether solely by Seller or jointly by Seller and Buyer, being under
the direction of, requested by, commissioned by, or in accordance to specific
requirements of Buyer. Buyer shall have the exclusive right to apply for or
register any patents, mask work rights, copyrights, and such other proprietary
protections, formal or informal, with respect to such Improvements, on a
worldwide basis, and to incorporate Improvements into the Services at no
additional charge in any manner. Seller shall cooperate as reasonably
requested by Buyer in order for Buyer to obtain all available protection of
any intellectual property rights related to any such Improvements and Seller
shall execute such documents, including assignment of rights, patent
assignments, render such assistance, including reasonable efforts to obtain
the execution of patent applications by the individual inventors of such
inventions, and take such other actions as Buyer may reasonably request, at
Buyer\'s expense, to apply for, register, perfect, confirm, and protect
Buyer's rights in the Services and any Improvements. Seller shall be solely
responsible for compensation payable to individual inventors of Seller by law,
if any, or by contract, if any.

  

  

(b) License. Seller hereby irrevocably grants to Buyer and its Affiliates as
of the Closing Date, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, worldwide
right and license to practice, reproduce in any medium and form, use, have
used, make, have made, license, sublicense, assemble, offer for sale, sell,
import, export, and otherwise transfer without attribution of any intellectual
property, whether pre-existing or later developed, necessary for any of the
performance of manufacture, distribution, sale and delivery of Services,
Improvements, or any terms of the Supply Agreement by either Buyer or Seller,
and Seller further covenants not to sue Buyer, its directed agents and end
users under this Section 6.9, including for any intellectual property Seller
may separately acquire hereafter that may be necessary under this Section 6.9.
Seller represents and warrants that Seller has all rights necessary and
sufficient to make the licenses and grants hereunder.

  

  

(c) Design Rights. Except as may otherwise be addressed in a development
agreement between Seller and Buyer, Seller agrees that, where Seller
undertakes activity of a research, development and/or design nature using
information provided by Buyer, Buyer shall own all rights in any resulting
work product, including without limitation all know-how, trade secrets and
copyrights, and Seller shall take all necessary steps to ensure that Buyer
obtains full legal title in and to said rights, including executing an
assignment of rights document prepared by Buyer.

  

  

Section 6.10 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation.

  

  

As an inducement for Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
Seller, Quinn and Quinn Holdings covenant and agree that for a period of five
years following the Closing Date:

  

  

(a) neither Seller, Quinn nor Quinn Holdings shall, other than with the prior
written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly compete with the Business as
it exists at the Closing Date, in any geographic location in which Seller is
conducting the Business at the Closing Date, except for the benefit of Buyer,
or assist any Person to do the same (the "Restricted Activity"), it being
acknowledged that the areas in which the Business operates are separate and
distinct covenants, severable one from another, and that all such areas shall
apply unless any such area is determined to be unreasonable, invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, in which case such area
shall not apply. Seller, Quinn and Quinn Holdings acknowledge that the words
"directly and indirectly" include Seller, Quinn and Quinn Holdings and any of
their Affiliates or successors, competing individually or in partnership or
jointly in or conjunction with any Person or as principal, agent, creditor,
advisor, consultant, owner, partner, independent, contractor, employee,
shareholders, director, officer or in any manner whatsoever. Seller, Quinn and
Quinn Holdings acknowledge that any breach of this Section 6.10 will result in
irreparable harm to the Buyer that could not be adequately compensated by
monetary award. Seller, Quinn and Quinn Holdings agree that in the event of
any such actual, threatened or attempted breach, in addition to all other
available remedies, Buyer shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction by way of restraining order,
injunction, decree or otherwise as may be appropriate to ensure compliance
with the provisions of this Section 6.10, without having to prove damages to
the court. Seller, Quinn and Quinn Holdings acknowledge that this covenant not
to compete is being provided as an inducement to the Buyer to enter into and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that this
Section 6.10 contains reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and
scope of Restricted Activity to be restrained that do not impose a greater
restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business. If any
provision of this Section 6.10 shall, for any reason, be judged by any court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such judgment
shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder of this Section 6.10. In
the event that the provisions of this Section 6.10 should ever be deemed to
exceed the time or geographic limitations permitted by applicable law, such
provision shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements. Buyer acknowledges that direct or
indirect collective ownership by Seller, Quinn or Quinn Holdings of up to five
percent or less of the outstanding common shares of any publicly traded
corporation, partnership or trust in which Seller, Quinn and Quinn Holdings
and their Affiliates act solely as passive investors shall not constitute a
breach of this Section 6.10.

  

  

(b) Neither Seller, Quinn nor Quinn Holdings shall, and Seller shall cause the
Seller Representative not to, other than with the prior written consent of
Buyer, solicit or attempt or cause to be solicited any Transferring Employee
or any officer, employee or consultant of any of the Acquired Companies,
however, the foregoing provision will not prevent Seller, Quinn, Quinn
Holdings or the Seller Representative from making general solicitations for
employment (by advertising in a newspaper or periodical of general
circulation) not specifically targeted to the Transferring Employees or
the officers, employees or consultants of any of the Acquired Companies, or
from employing any such person who responds to such a general non-targeted
solicitation or who contacts Seller, Quinn, Quinn Holdings or the Seller
Representative on his or her on initiative without any direct or indirect
solicitation by or encouragement from Seller, Quinn, Quinn Holdings or the
Seller Representative.

  

  

(c) Neither Seller, Quinn nor Quinn Holdings shall, and Seller shall cause the
Seller Representative not to, other than with the prior written consent of
Buyer, have any discussions, correspondence or other contact in respect of the
Restricted Activity with any customer, supplier or distributor (which is a
customer, supplier or distributor of Seller, Quinn or Quinn Holdings
immediately prior to the Closing Date) or attempt to direct any such customer,
supplier or distributor away from the Buyer or to discontinue or alter any one
or more of their relationships with the Buyer.

  

  

Section 6.11 Section 22 Election.

  

  

Seller and Buyer shall joint execute an election in prescribed form under
Section 22 of the Tax Act in respect of the Accounts Receivable and shall file
such election with their respective Tax Returns for their respective taxation
years that include the Closing Date.

shall remain in full force and effect until the date that is 18 months from
the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in Section 4.19 (Environmental Laws and

4.17, 4.19, 4.21, 4.22, 4.24, 4.25 and 4.27 being the "Seller Fundamental
Representations"). None of the covenants or other agreements contained in this

faith with reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in
writing by notice from the non-breaching party to the breaching party prior to

be performed by a Seller Party pursuant to this Agreement;

provided, however, Seller Parties shall not be required to indemnify or save
harmless Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.2 unless Seller Parties receive
notice in accordance with Section 8.5 on or prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period related to such representation and warranty as set
out in Section 8.1; provided further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
failure of any such notice to comply with the requirements set forth in
Section 8.5 shall not relieve Seller of its obligations hereunder, except to
the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced Seller.

Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Article VIII, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller Parties against, and shall hold Seller Parties harmless from
and against, any and all Damages incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon,

or warranties in determining the amount of any Damages); or

  

  

(b) any Breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement;

  

  

provided, however, Buyer shall not be required to indemnify or save harmless
Seller Parties pursuant to this Section 8.3 unless Buyer receives notice in
accordance with Section 8.5 on or prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period related to such representation and warranty as set out in

Section 8.4 Limitations.

  

  

The Party making a claim under this Article VIII is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party," and the Party against whom such claims are asserted under
this Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party." The
indemnification provided for in this Article VIII shall be subject to the
following limitations:

  

  

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as the case may be, until
the aggregate amount of all Damages in respect of indemnification under
Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 exceeds three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) of
the Initial Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), in which event the Indemnifying
Party shall pay and be liable for the full amount of all Damages, excluding
the Damages making up the Deductible. With respect to any claim as to which
the Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.2 or
Section 8.3, as the case may be, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
for any individual or series of related Damages that do not exceed $2,500 (the
"Deminimis Claims"), which Damages shall not be counted toward the Deductible
until the aggregate of all such Deminimis Claims exceeds $50,000; provided,
however, that the Deminimis Claims exception and the Deductible shall not
apply to (i) any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) to the
extent that such claim relates to a Breach of a Seller Fundamental
Representation, (ii) any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(c),
Section 8.2(d), Section 8.2 (e), Section 8.2(f) or Section 8.2(g) or (iii) any
Tax Indemnity (the matters set forth in the preceding clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) being referred to as the "Special Indemnified Matters"); provided,
further, that any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(d)
relating to termination of the Supply Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 or
Section 8.6 thereof, such Damages shall include an amount equal to the costs
and expenses incurred by Buyer in obtaining substitute Services (as defined in
the Supply Agreement) over the amount Buyer would have paid Seller for such
Services pursuant to the Supply Agreement for the period beginning with such
termination date and ending with the last day of the term of the Supply
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except for Damages arising out of a Special Indemnified Matter, Buyer
shall not be indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2 if the aggregate amount of
all Damages for which Buyer has received indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2 has exceeded twenty percent (20%) of the Initial Purchase Price.

  

  

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3
in respect of any Damages shall be limited to the amount of any Damages that
remain after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnified
Party in respect of any such claim, after offsetting against such deduction
the net present value of any future policy premium increases that result from
the claim by the Indemnifying Party for such indemnity, contribution or
similar payment.

  

  

(d) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of
multiple.

  

  

(e) Seller Parties shall be liable under this Article VIII for any Damages
based upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties of a Seller Party contained in this Agreement
notwithstanding any knowledge by Buyer of such inaccuracy or breach prior to
the Closing.

  

  

Section 8.5 Indemnification Procedures.

  

  

(a) Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a
"Third-Party Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the
Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written
notice thereof. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-
Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in, or (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8.5(a)), by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party\'s own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; provided that prior to assuming the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party must acknowledge that it would have an
indemnity obligation for the Damages resulting from such Third-Party Claim as
provided under this Article 8. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the fees and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) the Indemnifying
Party does not deliver the acknowledgement referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence within 30 days of receipt of notice of the Third-Party
Claim pursuant to this Section 8.5(a), (ii) the Third-Party Claim relates to
or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation, (iii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes
that an adverse determination with respect to the Third-Party Claim would be
detrimental to the reputation or future business prospects of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (iv) the Third-Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates or (v) the Third-Party Claim relates to Taxes. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject
to Section 8.5(b), it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend
such Third-Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 8.5(b), pay, compromise, defend such
Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Damages based upon,
arising from or relating to such Third-Party Claim. Seller Parties and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to
the provisions of Section 6.4) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and
furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third-Party Claim.

  

  

(b) Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this Section 8.5(b). If the Third-Party Claim relates to Taxes,
the Indemnified Party shall not enter into settlement of such Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If a firm offer is
made to settle a Third-Party Claim without leading to liability or the
creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such
Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to
such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event,
the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim
shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 8.5(a),
it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed).

  

  

(c) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages
that do not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party written notice
thereof. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail (taking into account the information then available to
the Indemnified Party) and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such
30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and
its professional advisors a reasonable opportunity during normal business
hours to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Party\'s investigation by giving such information and assistance (including

Section 10.16 Appointment of Seller Representative.

  

  

(a) Powers of Attorney. In order to efficiently administer the activities of
the Parties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, Seller hereby
designates Douglas J. Quinn ("Seller Representative") as Seller's true and
lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact and hereby grants Seller
Representative an irrevocable power of attorney ("Seller Representative
Appointment") and authorizes Seller Representative acting for Seller and in
Seller's name, place and stead, in any and all capacities (i) to do and
perform every act and thing required or permitted to be done by Seller or
Seller Representative hereunder or otherwise in connection with the agreements
and transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any of the other
Transaction Documents, as fully to all intents and purposes as Seller might or
could do in person, including the resolution of indemnity claims under Article
VIII of this Agreement and in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and any
transactions contemplated by the Escrow Agreement and the resolution of
arbitration claims under Article XI of this Agreement, to exercise all or any
of the powers, authority and discretion conferred on Seller under any such
agreement, to waive any terms and conditions of any such agreement (other than
the consideration to be received by Seller as provided in this Agreement), to
give notices on their behalf and to be its exclusive representative with
respect to any matter, suit, claim, action or proceeding arising with respect
to any transaction contemplated by any such agreement, including the defense,
settlement or compromise of any claim, action or proceeding for which Buyer
may be entitled to indemnification; and (ii) to execute, acknowledge and
deliver any instrument under seal or otherwise, and to do all things necessary
to carry out the intent hereof, hereby granting Seller Representative full
power and authority to act in and concerning the premises as fully and
effectually as Seller may do if personally present. Seller Representative
agrees to act as, and to undertake the duties and responsibilities of, such
agent and attorney-in-fact. In so acting, all decisions of the Seller
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
shall be taken by the affirmative vote (or written consent) of a majority of
the individuals then holding the title of Seller Representative, on a per
capita basis. This power of attorney is (x) coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable; and (y) durable and shall not be affected by any subsequent
dissolution or winding-up of Seller. Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees
that any act, consent or thing done by Seller Representative or any delivery
by Seller Representative of any waiver or amendment of this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document executed by Seller Representative or any decisions
made by Seller Representative pursuant to such power of attorney, shall be
binding upon Seller and its successors and assigns, whether the same shall
have been done either before or after Seller's dissolution and winding-up, as
fully as if Seller had taken such actions, executed and delivered such
documents or made such decisions. Seller agrees that third parties may rely
upon the representations of Seller Representative as to all matters relating
to any power granted to it under this Agreement, and no Person who may act in
reliance upon the representations of Seller Representative or the authority
granted to him shall incur any liability to Seller or its successors or
assigns as a result of permitting Seller Representative to exercise any power.

  

  

(b) Replacement of Seller Representative. Upon the resignation, death,
disability or incapacity of Seller Representative, Seller shall appoint a
substitute Seller Representative and shall promptly notify Buyer and Escrow
Agent thereof in writing.

  

  

(c) Actions of Seller Representative; Liability of Seller Representative.
Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by
Seller Representative, on behalf of Seller, pursuant to Section 10.16(a) above
(each, an "Authorized Action"), and that each Authorized Action shall be
binding on each Seller as fully as if Seller had taken such Authorized Action.
Seller agrees that Seller Representative is not a fiduciary and shall have no
liability to Seller for any Authorized Action, except to the extent that such
Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Seller agrees to pay, and to indemnify and hold harmless, Buyer
from and against any losses that it may suffer, sustain, or become subject to,
as the result of any claim by any Person that an Authorized Action is not
binding on, or enforceable against, Seller. In addition, Seller hereby
releases and discharges Buyer from and against any liability arising out of or
in connection with Seller Representative's failure to adhere to this Agreement
or to act in accordance with the terms of Seller Representative Appointment.
Seller agrees that Buyer and Escrow Agent shall be entitled to treat as
genuine, and as the document it purports to be, any letter, paper or other
document furnished to it by or on behalf of Seller Representative, and
reasonably believed by Buyer or Escrow Agent, as the case may be, to be
genuine and to have been signed and presented by the proper party or parties.

  

  

ARTICLE XI

  

  

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  

  

Section 11.1 Resolution by Parties.

  

  

Seller Representative and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to
resolve any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Breach, interpretation, termination or validity thereof (a
"Dispute") within thirty (30) days after the date that a Party gives written
notice of such Dispute to the other Party, other than as provided in Section
2.8(e). If Seller Representative and Buyer are unable to reach agreement
within such thirty (30) day period (or such longer period as Seller
Representative and Buyer may agree) then either Seller Representative or Buyer
may request the utilization of the services of a professional mediator who is
unaffiliated with either Seller Representative or Buyer and is knowledgeable
in the field of the Dispute, and the other Party or parties to the Dispute
shall cooperate with such request and share the reasonable costs of such
mediator. Such mediation shall be concluded within thirty (30) days of such
mediator's selection. Without limiting any of the rights of the Members under
this Agreement, the mediation procedures herein must be exhausted by a Party
prior to the pursuit of binding arbitration in accordance with Section 11.2.
All negotiations pursuant to this Section 11.1 shall be considered
confidential settlement discussions, and no Party may offer into evidence,
mention or otherwise use statements made in connection with such negotiations
in any subsequent alternative dispute resolution or litigation proceeding.

  

  

Section 11.2 Binding Arbitration.

  

  

Any Dispute that is not settled to the mutual satisfaction of the Parties
pursuant to Section 11.1 shall be settled by binding arbitration between
Seller Representative and Buyer conducted in Calgary, Alberta (or such other
location as may be agreed to by Seller Representative and Buyer) and in
accordance with the rules adopted by the Arbitration and Mediation Society of
Alberta (the "AAMS") in effect on the date that either Seller Representative
or Buyer gives notice of its demand for arbitration under this Section 11.2.
The submitting Party shall submit such Dispute to arbitration by providing a
written demand for arbitration to the other Party, and Seller Representative
and Buyer shall select a single neutral arbitrator with significant contract
resolution experience. If Seller Representative and Buyer cannot agree on a
single neutral arbitrator within fifteen (15) Business Days after the written
demand for arbitration is provided, then the arbitrator shall be selected
pursuant to the National Arbitration Rules of the ADR Institute of Canada,
Inc. The decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the
Parties in all respects, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between
the Parties regarding any Dispute submitted to arbitration pursuant to this
Section 11.2. Judgment upon any award may be entered and enforced in any court
having jurisdiction over a Party or any of its assets. Each Party shall each
bear the cost of preparing and presenting its own case. The cost of the
arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be sole
responsibility of the losing Party. The arbitrator shall be instructed to
establish procedures such that a decision can be rendered within sixty (60)
calendar days of the appointment of the arbitrator. All limitations of damages
herein shall be binding upon the arbitrator. This Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the Parties shall remain in full force and effect pending the
award in any arbitration proceeding hereunder. The arbitration conducted
pursuant hereto shall be confidential. A Party shall not disclose or permit
the disclosure of any information about the evidence adduced or the documents
produced by the other Parties in the arbitration proceedings or about the
existence, contents or results of the proceeding except as may be required by
(i) law, rule, applicable regulation, interrogatories, subpoenas, civil
investigative demands or other similar legal process, stock exchange rules or
disclosure requirement of a governmental authority, including the Securities
and Exchange Commission, or (ii) as required in an action in aid of
arbitration or for enforcement of an arbitral award.

  

  

Section 11.3 Exceptions to Arbitration Obligation.

  

  

The obligation to arbitrate shall not be binding upon any Party with respect
to (i) requests for preliminary injunctions, temporary restraining orders,
specific performance or other procedures in a court of competent jurisdiction
to obtain interim relief when deemed necessary by such court to preserve the
status quo or prevent irreparable injury pending resolution by arbitration of
the actual Dispute, or (ii) actions to collect payments not subject to a bona
fide Dispute.

  |  

Disposition of Deposit. Upon receipt by Blakes of a written direction signed
by each of Lufkin and Quinn, Blakes is hereby irrevocably authorized and
directed to pay the Deposit and interest accrued thereon, if any, in
accordance with such written direction. Blakes shall have no obligation to
make any determination as to the validity of any such direction or any claim
made by any party for entitlement to the Deposit and Blakes shall be entitled
to continue to hold the Deposit until such time as Blakes receives a written
direction signed by both Lufkin and Quinn as contemplated in this Section 2 or
until Blakes is directed by final judgment of a Court as to the disposition
of the Deposit.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

3.

  |  

Dispute. Blakes shall have the right at any time to deposit the Deposit and
interest earned thereon, if any, with the Accountant of the Alberta Court of

Quinn immediately after such deposit is made.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.

deemed to be the agent of either Lufkin or Quinn in respect of the escrow
herein referred to. Blakes shall not be liable to either Lufkin or Quinn for

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

5.

  |  

Indemnity. Lufkin and Quinn hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify
and hold Blakes harmless from and against all costs, claims (including those

against the Deposit and/or interest accrued on the Deposit.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

7.

  |  

Limitation on Duties. It is understood and agreed that Blakes\' only duties
and obligations in respect of the Deposit are expressly set out in this
Agreement. Blakes shall have the right to consult with separate counsel of its
own choosing (if it deems such consultation advisable) and shall not be liable
for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it if Blakes acts in
accordance with the advice of such counsel. Blakes shall be protected if it
acts upon any written or oral communication, notice, certificate or other
instrument or document believed by Blakes to be genuine and to be properly
given or executed without the necessity of verifying the truth or accuracy of
the same or the authority of the person giving or executing the same.

8.

  |  

Resignation of Blakes. Blakes may, at any time, resign its obligations under
this Agreement and be discharged from all further duties and liabilities
hereunder by giving Lufkin and Quinn at least 10 days\' notice in writing of
its intention to resign or such shorter notice as Lufkin and Quinn may accept
as sufficient. Lufkin and Quinn agree that they shall forthwith upon receipt
of such notice appoint a new stakeholder to act in the place and stead of
Blakes and if they fail to agree on such appointment, Lufkin or Quinn or
Blakes may apply to a Judge of the Alberta Court of Queen\'s Bench on such
notice as such Judge may direct for the appointment of a new stakeholder.
Upon any new appointment, the new stakeholder will be vested with the same
powers, rights, duties and obligations as if it had been originally named
herein as stakeholder and such new stakeholder shall enter into an agreement
with Lufkin and Quinn agreeing to be bound by all of the provisions of this
Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

9.

  |

any, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, Blakes shall be
relieved and discharged from all claims and liabilities relating to the
Deposit and interest thereon, if any, and Blakes shall not be subject to any
claims made by or on behalf of any party hereto.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

10.

  |  

No Conflict. The fact that Blakes is acting as stakeholder under this
Agreement shall not in any way prevent it from representing Lufkin and/or or
its associates and affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
in the Main Agreement or any litigation arising from the Main Agreement or
this Agreement or from representing Lufkin and/or or its associates and
affiliates or any other party in any other capacity or in any other
