Condition in accordance with such condition, undertaking, obligation, measure,
divestment and/or commitment shall be deemed not to be satisfactory to the
Purchasers for the purpose of clause 3.1 and accordingly the Purchasers may
determine (acting reasonably) whether any such conditional approval from the

may be) on or before 5.00 p.m. on the Back-Stop Date, then each of the
Purchasers Representative and the Sellers Representative may at any time
after 5.00 p.m. on the Back-Stop Date (provided, for the avoidance of doubt,
that Completion has not taken place) terminate this Agreement by written
notice to the other party, provided, however, that no party shall be entitled
to invoke non-fulfilment of a Condition as a basis for termination pursuant to
this clause 4.1 if such non-fulfilment is caused by breach of this Agreement
by that party (and for the purposes of this clause 4.1, any such breach by
any of the Sellers shall be deemed a breach by all of them and any such breach
by any of the Purchasers shall be deemed a breach of by all of them). 
---|--- 
 



   4.2 | If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with clause 4.1,
all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall
immediately terminate (except for the provisions of clauses 1
(Interpretation), 33 (Entire Agreement), 34 (Notices), 35 (Announcements), 36
(Confidentiality), 37 (Costs and expenses), 42 (Choice of governing law), 43
(Jurisdiction), and 44 (Agent for service)), but, (for the avoidance of

termination shall continue to exist. 
---|--- 



   4.3 | Subject to clause 4.4, this Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to Completion by the Purchasers Representative if, between the
time of this Agreement and Completion, it provides a written notice of
termination to the Sellers Representative if: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | any of the Warranties (other than the Warranty set out in
paragraph 16 (A) of Schedule 3 (Warranties)) of the Sellers and/or the Seller
Guarantor are, or become, untrue or misleading in any material respect in the
context of the Transaction or there occurs a breach by any Seller and/or the
Seller Guarantor of any of the Warranties, any such breach being material in
the context of the Transaction; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | there occurs a breach by the Sellers or the Seller Guarantor
or any member of the Retained Group of the terms of this Agreement (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, clause 7.3) (other than a breach of the
Warranties as provided for in clause 4.3(A)), and any such breach is material
in the context of the Transaction; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (C) | a Material Adverse Event occurs. 
---|---|--- 



   4.4 |

The Purchasers Representative shall not be entitled to exercise its right to
terminate pursuant to clause 4.3 if such breach or event is capable of remedy
(including by way of economic compensation) and within ten (10) Business Days
of the Sellers Representative receiving notice of the breach or event, such
breach or event is  

---|--- 
 



39  remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchasers Representative
(acting reasonably) at no cost to the Purchasers. 

---|--- 
 



   4.5 | If the Purchasers Representative becomes entitled to terminate
this Agreement under clause 4.3 and elects not to do so, each Purchaser shall,
subject to Schedule 4 (Limitation on the Sellers liability), following
Completion be entitled to pursue all other remedies (including to make a claim
for damages or indemnification) under this Agreement in respect of any breach
or event giving rise to such entitlement to terminate. 
---|--- 



   4.6 | If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with clause 4.3(A)
or 4.3(B): 
---|--- 



     | (A) | the Sellers Representative shall pay on its own behalf (by
way of wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account or
accounts designated in writing by the Purchasers Representative) to the
Purchasers Representative (on its own behalf) within two (2) Business Days of
the Sellers Representative receiving notice in writing from the Purchasers
Representative terminating this Agreement in accordance with clause 4.3(A) or
4.3(B) the Break Fee in recognition of the loss, damage and/or expense
suffered or incurred by the Purchasers Representative in connection with this
Agreement, any of the Share Purchase Documents and/or the Transaction by way
of liquidated damages as full and final settlement of all claims the
Purchasers may have against the Sellers, the Sellers Representative, any
other member of the Retained Group or any member of the Group under this
Agreement, any of the Share Purchase Documents or otherwise in respect of the
Transaction (in each case, other than in the case of fraud by the Sellers, the
Seller Guarantor or any other member of the Retained Group in the context of
the Transaction); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | upon the payment under clause 4.6(A) being duly made to the
Purchaser, all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall terminate (except for the provisions of clauses 1 (Interpretation), 33
(Entire Agreement), 34 (Notices), 35 (Announcements), 36 (Confidentiality), 37
(Costs and expenses), 42 (Choice of governing law), 43 (Jurisdiction), and 44
(Agent for service)).  
---|---|--- 

The parties acknowledge that the Break Fee is a genuine pre-estimate of all
and any losses which the Purchasers may suffer were they to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with clauses 4.3(A) or 4.3(B).



   4.7 | The parties consider, and shall use all reasonable endeavours to
secure, that the Break Fee is outside the scope of VAT and is not treated for
VAT purposes as consideration for a taxable supply. If the Break Fee is
treated by any Tax Authority in whole or part as the consideration for a
taxable supply, the parties shall co-operate to restructure the Break Fee so
as to reverse such treatment. If, notwithstanding such cooperation, the Break
Fee is still to be treated by any Tax Authority in whole or part as the
consideration for a taxable supply and: 
---|--- 



     | (A) |

any of the Sellers or the Sellers Representative (or the representative
member of any group of which any of the Sellers or the Sellers
Representative is a member for VAT purposes) is liable to account for VAT in
respect of that 

---|---|--- 
 



40  supply, the Purchasers shall pay to the Sellers Representative or, as the
case may be, the relevant Seller, an amount equal to half of the aggregate
amount of VAT for which any of the Sellers or the Sellers Representative (or
that representative member) is liable to account in respect of that supply and
which the Sellers Representative or the relevant Seller (or the
representative member) is not entitled to recover (whether by way of credit
or by way of repayment) from any Tax Authority; or 

---|--- 



     | (B) | any of the Purchasers or the Purchasers Representative (or
the representative member of any group of which any of the Purchasers is a
member for VAT purposes) is liable to account for VAT in respect of that
supply, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchasers Representative or, as the
case may be, the relevant Purchaser an amount equal to the aggregate amount of
VAT for which any of the Purchasers or the Purchasers Representative (or
that representative member) is liable to account in respect of that supply
(the "VAT Chargeable") less the lower of (i) half the VAT Chargeable and (ii)
half the amount in respect of VAT for which neither the Sellers
Representative nor the relevant Seller (or the representative member) would be
entitled to recover (whether by way of credit or by way of repayment) from any
Tax Authority as input were it to pay the Purchasers Representative or the
relevant Purchaser (as the case may be) an amount equal to the VAT Chargeable. 
---|---|--- 



   4.8 | If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with clause 4.3(C),
all obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall end (except for the
provisions of clauses 1 (Interpretation), 33 (Entire Agreement), 34
(Notices), 35 (Announcements), 36 (Confidentiality), 37 (Costs and expenses),
42 (Choice of governing law), 43 (Jurisdiction), and 44 (Agent for service)). 
---|--- 
 



   4.9 | Save as set out above, all other remedies, including those of
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief, shall be excluded
in case of the occurrence of any of the breaches or events set out in clause
4.3 (save in the case of fraud on the part of any Seller, the Seller Guarantor
or any member of the Retained Group in connection with this Agreement and/or
the Share Purchase Documents).  
---|--- 



   5. | Pre-Completion Covenants and Leakage 
---|--- 



   5.1 | Subject to clause 5.2 the Sellers shall procure that between the
date of this Agreement and Completion or this Agreement being terminated in
accordance with clauses 4.1 or 4.3: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | each member of the Group shall continue to carry on its
business in the normal course in the same manner as such member of the Group
operated such business in the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this
Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) |

the members of the Group shall use all reasonable endeavours to preserve the
Aker Soho Business and the goodwill of its customers, suppliers and other
business relationships and to retain the Senior Employees and the Specified

the Purchasers Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed); and  
---|---|--- 



     | (F) | the Sellers Representative or any of the Sellers shall
notify the Purchasers Representative of any matter, circumstance, act or

omission. 
---|---|--- 
 



   5.2 | Clause 5.1 shall not operate so as to restrict or prevent: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | any action reasonably and proportionately undertaken by or
in respect of any member of the Group in an emergency or disaster situation
with the intention of minimising any adverse effect thereof on the Aker Soho
Business (and of which the Purchasers Representative will be promptly
notified in writing and, where practicable, consulted prior to such action
being taken); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (B) | the completion or performance of any obligations undertaken
pursuant to any contract, other binding legal arrangement entered into by any
member of the Group (including any tenders made by any member of the Group)
prior to the date of this Agreement (provided that if such contract or other
binding legal arrangement is a Material Contract, it has been disclosed in the
Data Room), or required by law;  
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | any increase in emoluments of any Soho Staff where such
increase is made in accordance with the normal practice of the relevant
employing member of the Group;  
---|---|--- 



     | (D) | any matter carried out pursuant to any express obligations
on the part of the Sellers or any other members of the Retained Group
contemplated in this Agreement or the Share Purchase Documents; 
---|---|--- 



     | (E) |

any matter which constitutes Permitted Leakage provided that any Permitted
Leakage under paragraph (A) of Schedule 7 (Permitted Leakage) shall be of the
equivalent nature (but not necessarily amounts) to those ordinary course 

---|---|--- 
 



42  payments set out in the schedule (and designated as such) provided to the
Purchasers Representative prior to the date of this Agreement as referred to
in clause 5.12;  

---|--- 



     | (F) | any other matter required by law or regulation; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (G) | any matter undertaken at the express written request of any
of the Purchasers. 
---|---|--- 



   5.3 | Each of the Sellers represents, warrants and undertakes to each
of the Purchasers that from and including the Reference Date and until
Completion, other than in respect of Permitted Leakage: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | none of the Companies has declared, authorised, paid or made
(whether actual or deemed) to any member of the Retained Group any dividend,
distribution or other return of capital (whether in respect of any security
issued by any Company and whether by reduction of capital or purchase of
shares) or will do any of those things; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | no member of the Group has made or agreed to make any

of business on arms length terms on a basis that is consistent with past
practice or will do any of those things; 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | no member of the Group has transferred or surrendered any

---|---|--- 
 



43 agreement or arrangement to give effect to any of the matters referred to in
clauses (A) to (F) above.  
---|---|--- 

The occurrence of any of the events set out in this clause 5.3 at or before
Completion but on or after the Reference Date, together with those matters
described as leakage in clause 5.12, shall constitute an incident of "Leakage"
save to the extent that such events, or matters constitute Permitted Leakage.
For the avoidance of doubt:

 



     | (i) | any matter which constitutes Leakage or Permitted Leakage
shall not be taken into account in the Completion Accounts nor in calculating
the Adjustment Amount; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the representations, warranties and undertakings contained
in this clause 5.3 do not constitute Warranties for the purposes of this
Agreement, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Purchasers sole remedy in respect of Leakage shall be by way of
indemnification pursuant to clause 5.5. 
---|---|--- 



   5.4 | The Purchasers Representative shall provide the Sellers
Representative with a written notice of any claim in respect of the indemnity
under clause 5.5 (such notice to specify, having regard to the information
available to the Purchasers at that time, a summary of the alleged Leakage

required Leakage Adjustment Amount).  
---|--- 



   5.5 | Subject to clauses 5.7 to 5.10, each of the Sellers undertakes to
pay the Purchasers Representative (for the account of the Purchasers as the
Purchasers Representative may direct) such amount as is required to hold the
Purchasers harmless from any Leakage and against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, costs and reasonably and
properly incurred expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in respect of
any amount of Leakage and the amount of the relevant Leakage together with any
liability of any member of the Group to make a payment of, or in respect of,
Tax thereon (including, without limitation, an amount equal to any amount
payable in respect of VAT chargeable in respect of the supply for which such
Leakage is the consideration, to the extent that such amount in respect of VAT
is not otherwise recoverable by the relevant member of the Group (or any
person which is for VAT purposes a member of the same group as that member of
the Group and such recovered VAT has been accounted for to that member), using
all reasonable endeavours to recover such amount as may be practicable). The
amount so indemnified shall comprise a "Leakage Adjustment Amount". 
---|--- 



   5.6 | [Intentionally omitted] 
---|--- 



   5.7 | If the Sellers liability under the indemnity in clause 5.5 is
agreed in respect of one or more Leakage Adjustment Amounts before the
Completion Date, notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement, the parties
hereby agree that the Purchase Price payable by the relevant Purchasers for
the Shares shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate of all such
Leakage Adjustment Amounts, plus interest on such aggregate amount
(calculated from the day that the Leakage occurs) at: 
---|--- 
 



44 calculated from the date on which the Leakage occurred until the date of this
Agreement (inclusive) at a rate per annum of twelve (12) per cent., such
interest to accrue from day to day and be compounded annually each 31
December; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | an amount of interest on such Leakage Adjustment Amount
calculated from but not including the date of this Agreement until the date of
actual payment at a rate per annum of four and a half (4.5) per cent., such
interest to accrue from day to day and be compounded annually each 31
December. 
---|---|--- 

Any reduction in the Purchase Price payable by the Purchasers pursuant to
this clause 5.7 shall be:



     | (i) | a reduction in the proportion of the Purchase Price payable
by the relevant Purchaser(s) which is allocated for the Shares in the Company
to which the incident of Leakage relates (as such allocation is set out in
Appendix 1 (Allocation of Purchase Price)); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to the extent that the reduction in the Purchase Price
payable pursuant to clause 5.7(B)(i) exceeds the proportion of the Purchase
Price payable by the relevant Purchaser(s) allocated for the Shares in the
Company to which the incident of Leakage relates, as a reduction in the
Purchase Price allocated for the Shares (other than those in the Company to
which the incident of Leakage relates) pro rata to the proportion of the
Purchase Price allocated to such Shares as set out in Appendix 1 (Allocation
of Purchase Price). 
---|---|--- 



   5.8 | If the Sellers liability under the indemnity in clause 5.5 in
respect of one or more Leakage Adjustment Amounts is agreed or determined
after the Completion Date, to the extent such Leakage Adjustment Amount is
not already accounted for by way of a reduction to the Purchase Price pursuant
to clause 5.7, the relevant Seller shall be liable to pay to the Purchasers
Representative and/or the relevant Purchaser(s) immediately following such
agreement or determination that Leakage Adjustment Amount plus interest on
such amount (calculated from the date the Leakage occurred at the applicable
rate of interest (and compounded as) referred to in clauses 5.7(A) and
5.7(B). The Leakage Adjustment Amounts (and any applicable interest) shall be: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | a reduction in the Purchase Price paid by the relevant
Purchaser(s) and allocated for the Shares in the Company to which the incident
of Leakage relates; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | to the extent that such Leakage Adjustment Amount exceeds
the part of the Purchase Price allocated for the Shares in the Company to
which the incident of Leakage relates, as a reduction of the Purchase Price
paid by the relevant Purchaser(s) allocated for the Shares (other than those
in the Company to which the incident of Leakage relates) pro rata to the
consideration allocated to such Shares as set out in Appendix 1 (Allocation
of Purchase Price). 
---|---|--- 



   5.9 |

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Sellers shall not
be liable to pay any Leakage Adjustment Amount unless the
Sellers Representative has received a 

---|--- 
 



45  written notice from the Purchasers Representative in respect of such
Leakage Adjustment Amount pursuant to clause 5.4 on or before 30 December
2012.  

---|--- 



   5.10 | The Sellers undertake to procure that prior to Completion the
Pre-Completion Reorganisation Agreements in respect of the Pre-Completion
Reorganisation Steps are effective in accordance with their respective terms,
and the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative shall use
their reasonable endeavours to assist each other in procuring the same. 
---|--- 
 



   5.11 | In this Agreement, "Negative Leakage" shall refer to and be
applicable in the following circumstances: 
---|--- 
 



     | (A) | if and to the extent applicable law or regulations
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, transfer pricing rules) requires the
purchase prices set out in the Pre-Completion Reorganisation Agreements to be
deviated from, any deviation which results in any cost, expense or liabilities
(including without limitation, Tax and/or amounts in respect of Tax) from the
Group to the Retained Group shall be treated as Leakage and any deviation
which results in an irrevocable cash payment to the Group shall be treated as
Negative Leakage; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | in closing out the Soho Hedging Contracts prior to
Completion in accordance with clause 17.1, any cost, expense or liabilities
(including, without limitation, Tax and/or amounts in respect of Tax) to the
Group shall be treated as Leakage and any net benefit received or retained by
any member of the Group from the Retained Group as a direct result of the
termination shall be treated as Negative Leakage; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | an amount of US$ 9,000,000 of cash within Aker Projects
(Shanghai) Company Limited which the parties have agreed may be distributed to
a member of the Retained Group pursuant to paragraph (G) of Schedule 7
(Permitted Leakage) and to the extent that such amount is not so distributed
prior to Completion shall be treated as Negative Leakage. 
---|---|--- 
 

The provisions of clauses 5.7 to 5.10 relating to Leakage, including the
provisions relating to interest from the Reference Date, shall apply mutatis
mutandis to Negative Leakage (such that the Purchase Price shall be increased
by an amount equal to the Negative Leakage).



   5.12 | Not later than two (2) clear Business Days prior to Completion,
the Sellers shall provide the Purchasers Representative with a schedule
setting out details of all ordinary course payments made to the Retained
Group which the Sellers consider to be Permitted Leakage for the purposes of
paragraph (A) of Schedule 7 (Permitted Leakage) in substantially the same form
as the equivalent schedule provided to the Purchasers Representative prior
to the date of this Agreement for the purposes of assisting the Purchasers in
identifying the nature of ordinary course payments made to the Retained Group.
The delivery and receipt of the schedules contemplated by this clause 5.12
shall not constitute agreement by the Purchasers that the payments designated
therein shall be Permitted Leakage and shall be without prejudice to the
Purchasers rights to be indemnified under clause 5.5. 
---|--- 
 



46 ---|---|--- 
  

6. Consideration

 |  | 
   | 
  

6.1 The total consideration for the sale of the Shares (the
"Purchase Price") shall be the payment by the Purchasers of the sum of the
Initial Purchase Price and the Adjustment Amount (if any).

 |  | 
   | 
  

6.2 Any payment made by any party to the other under this Agreement
(other than a payment under clause 6.1) shall (so far as possible) be an
adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent of the payment. Any such
adjustment shall, except where provided otherwise, be allocated to the Shares
in each Company pro rata to the Purchase Price payable by the relevant
Purchaser(s) for the Shares in each Company as set out in Appendix 1
(Allocation of Purchase Price).

 |  | 
   | 
  

6.3 On Completion, each Purchaser shall pay or procure the payment of
its respective portion of the Initial Purchase Price (less, if and to the
extent relevant, the Escrow Amount and, if applicable, the amount referred to
in clause 3.13(B)) to the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
and shall (if and to the extent relevant) pay or procure the payment of its
respective portion of the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Account, in each case,
as further set out in Part B of Schedule 2 (Completion arrangements). The
parties agree to allocate the Initial Purchase Price in accordance with the
allocations set out in Appendix 1 (Allocation of Purchase Price). The
proportion of the total Purchase Price attributed to the Shares in each
Company to which each Seller is entitled and which each Purchaser shall pay
is that set out in Appendix 1 (Allocation of Purchase Price).

 |  | 
   | 
  

6.4 The parties shall comply with the provisions of Schedule 11
(Completion Accounts) in calculating and paying the Adjustment Amount.
Subject always to the provisions of clause 6.5:

 |  | 
   | 
  

(A) if the Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, such amount shall be
paid by the Purchasers Representative (on behalf of the Purchasers) to the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers); and

 |  | 
   | 
  

(B) if the Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, such amount shall be
paid by the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) to the
Purchasers Representative (on behalf of the Purchasers).

 |  | 
   | 
  

6.5 No Adjustment Amount shall be payable by either party to the extent
that the Adjustment Amount amounts to:

 |  | 
   | 
  

(A) less than US$[ *** ] (the "Collar"); and

 |  | * 
   | 
  

(B) more than US$[ *** ] (the "Cap").

 |  | * 
   | 
  

For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Adjustment Amount amounts
to more than the Collar, only the excess above the Collar amount shall be
payable, and to the extent that the Adjustment Amount amounts to more than
the Cap, an amount equal to the difference between the Cap and the Collar
shall be payable.

 |  | 

* Confidential Treatment Requested 

 



47 allocated pro rata to the proportion of the Purchase Price allocated to the
Shares as set out in Appendix I (Allocation of Purchase Price) (unless such
Adjustment Amount relates to a particular Company or Companies, in which case,
such Adjustment Amount shall be allocated to such Company or Companies) and
shall be a reduction or increase (as the case may be) in the Purchase Price. 
---|--- 



   6.7 | Any Adjustment Amount payable shall be due and payable by the
relevant party on the date (the "Due Date") falling ten (10) Business Days
after the date on which the Completion Accounts are agreed or determined in
accordance with Schedule 11 (Completion Accounts) and shall carry interest at
the rate of interest (and compounded as) referred to in clause 5.7, for the
period from the Completion Date until the Due Date (or the date of payment,
if earlier), after which interest shall accrue at a rate of four (4) per cent
above the rate applicable pursuant to clause 5.7, such interest to accrue from
day to day and be compounded annually each 31 December. Any Adjustment Amount
payable by the Sellers shall be payable first from the Escrow Account or by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the Purchasers under the
Sellers Bank Guarantee (as applicable).  
---|--- 



   6.8 | Subject to clause 6.9, all sums payable by the parties under this
clause 6 or otherwise under the terms of this Agreement, the Tax Covenant, the
Escrow Agreement, the Sellers Bank Guarantee and the Pre-Completion
Reorganisation Agreements shall be paid free and clear of all deductions or
withholdings whatsoever, save only as may be required by law. If any
deductions or withholdings are required by law to be made from any of the
sums payable under any such agreements, the relevant party shall pay to the
recipient of that payment (the "Recipient") such sum as will, after the
deduction or withholding has been made, leave the Recipient with the same
amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such
requirement to make a deduction or withholding. 
---|--- 



   6.9 | The Purchasers shall not be required to pay an additional amount
pursuant to clause 6.8 to the extent that the deduction or withholding in
question is required to be made in connection with any liability assessable
or payable under any Chinese Tax laws and regulations and/or as a result of
the enforcement of relevant administrative measures by a Chinese Tax Authority
arising in respect of, by reference to or in consequence of the acquisition
by Jacobs Engineering Singapore Pte. Ltd. of the Shares in Aker Projects
(Shanghai) Company Limited. 
---|---

the benefit and value of the Aker Soho Business and that the reliance of the
Aker Soho Business on services provided to it by the Retained Group is
reduced in a timely and orderly fashion. 
---|--- 
 



68 Sellers and the Purchasers shall work together and jointly co-operate in good
faith to identify the transitional services necessary to be provided to the
Group and to the Retained Group (as the case may be) following Completion
under the Transitional Services Agreement and the Transitional Personnel
Access Agreement and to identify the personnel of the Retained Group and the
Group (as the case may be) who may be required to provide services on a
temporary basis following Completion under the Transitional Personnel Access
Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   19.3 | At Completion, the Sellers Representative shall procure that
Aker Business Services Inc. shall, and the Purchasers Representative shall
(or shall procure that the relevant member(s) of the Purchasers Group shall)
enter into the Transitional Services Agreement in substantially the form set
out in Part B of Appendix 7 (Agreed form documents) (subject to clause 19.4)
and on terms pursuant to which Aker Business Services Inc. and members of the
Group will provide or procure the provision of the identified transitional
services to the Group and the Retained Group (as the case may be) for the
period and on the terms specified therein.  
---|--- 



   19.4 | Between the date of this Agreement and Completion, the parties
shall work together and jointly co-operate in good faith to ensure that each
of the Transitional Services Agreement and the Transitional Personnel Access
Agreement achieves a tax efficient result, and with respect to the
Transitional Services Agreement only, subject always to the presumption that
in the absence of a mutually convenient result on or before Completion, the
transitional services to be supplied pursuant to the Transitional Services
Agreement will be supplied by and to the same companies and on the same basis
as was the case immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.  
---|--- 



   19.5 | At Completion, the Sellers Representative shall procure that
the relevant member(s) of the Retained Group shall and the Purchasers
Representative (or such member(s) of the Purchasers Group as it may direct)
shall enter into the Transitional Personnel Access Agreement in substantially
the form set out in Part B of Appendix 7 (Agreed form documents) and on terms
pursuant to which the Group and the Retained Group may access the services of
personnel of the Retained Group and the Group (as the case may be) for the
period and on the terms specified therein. 
---|--- 
 



   19.6 | The draft Transitional Services Agreement and Transitional
Personnel Access Agreement set out in Part B of Appendix 7 (Agreed form
documents) are not in agreed form but the parties intend that such agreements
will be in substantially the same form as such drafts, subject to such
amendments as the parties may agree prior to Completion. If the parties fail
to agree the terms of the Transitional Services Agreement and/or Transitional
Personnel Access Agreement prior to Completion, the Seller Guarantor and the
Purchaser Guarantor shall procure that members of the Retained Group or the
Group (as the case may be) shall provide any Transitional Services set out in
Appendix 6 (Transitional Services) as may be reasonably requested by members
of the Group or the Retained Group (as the case may be) for the period
reasonably requested (provided that such period shall be no longer than
eighteen (18) months) on the terms under which the corresponding services
were provided during the Reference Period and in accordance with the terms set
out in Appendix 6 (Transitional Services). 
---|--- 
 



69 pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement or clause 19.6, the Purchasers
shall procure that, as soon as reasonably practicable following Completion,
the Seller Guarantor is relieved of its obligation to procure the provision of
management services in relation to the Pension Schemes pursuant to the
Transitional Services Agreement.  
---|--- 



   19.8 | The Sellers and the Purchasers acknowledge that the current
project specific arrangements between Aker Clean Carbon AS, as owner of the
technology for the development and commercialisation of CO2 carbon capture
and storage and upgrades/developments of such, and certain members of the
Group, as providers of engineering and related services, will continue on
unchanged terms after Completion. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes
the existing Back-to-Back Subcontracting Agreement dated 12 March 2010 between
Aker Process Limited and Aker Clean Carbon AS in respect of the CCS
Demonstration Project for Scottish Power Generation Limited. Nothing in
this Agreement, any of the Share Purchase Documents or any other agreement
between the parties (or the members of their respective groups) shall restrict
or limit the rights of Aker Clean Carbon AS as the exclusive owner of the CCS
Technology and all rights related to it. 
---|--- 



   19.9 | The Seller Guarantor shall take all reasonable steps to procure
that on or prior to Completion Aker Clean Carbon AS and Aker Process Ltd (or
the appropriate member of the Group) shall enter into an agreement with
Scottish Power Generation Limited for the second phase of the CCS
Demonstration Project. For the further avoidance of doubt, the existing
Partner Agreement dated 5 March 2008 as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated 18
September 2009 between Aker Solutions AS and Aker Clean Carbon AS shall remain
wholly within the Retained Group following Completion. 
---|--- 
 



   19.10 | The Sellers and the Purchasers shall work together and jointly
co-operate in good faith to agree the terms of an agreement, and to enter into
such agreement at Completion, pursuant to which Aker Powergas Private Limited
shall provide services to the members of the Group in respect of projects
ongoing at Completion on substantially the same terms as services are
currently being provided to members of the Group under the Engineering Term
Services Agreement dated 2 January 2010, by and among Aker Kvaerner and its
subsidiaries and Aker Powergas Private Limited and the Auxiliary Services
Agreement dated 9 February 2007 by and among Aker Kvaerner and its
subsidiaries and Aker Powergas Systems Private Limited. Such agreement shall
supersede the existing agreements. However, to the extent that no such
agreement is agreed on or before Completion, the existing agreements shall
remain in full force and effect. 
---|--- 



   19.11 | The Seller Guarantor shall procure that from Completion and to
the extent permitted by law, the Soho Powergas Employees shall not be assigned
to projects other than:  
---|--- 



     | (A) | the projects of the Aker Soho Business ongoing at Completion
until the work of the Soho Powergas Employees and/or the relevant members of
the Retained Group on such projects is complete; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) |

other projects for the Aker Soho Business in accordance with past practice, 

---|---|--- 
 



70  for as long as such Soho Powergas Employees are employed by a member of the
Retained Group provided, however, that this shall only apply if and to the
extent that the Aker Soho Business continues actually to engage Aker Powergas
Private Limited in respect of such projects to be performed by that company
and managed by the Soho Powergas Employees and accordingly, the obligations on
the Seller Guarantor shall cease or reduce if and to the extent that the Aker
Soho Business ceases or reduces the extent to which it actually engages Aker
Powergas Private Limited. The Seller Guarantor has delivered to the
Purchasers Representative prior to the date of this Agreement a schedule
of the Soho Powergas Employees setting forth, by individual, a list of
projects of the Aker Soho Business on which such individual is working at the
date of this Agreement.

shall co-operate in good faith and use their reasonable endeavours to procure

the Group; and

     | (B) | the Senior Employees enter into retention agreements with a
member of the Group, such agreements to be in the form reasonably prescribed
by the Purchasers Representative.  
---|---|--- 



   19.13 | The Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative
shall co-operate in good faith to formulate a joint strategy pursuant to
which, to the extent permitted by law:

Business Services Limited who work exclusively for the Aker Soho Business
transfer to a member of the Group as soon as reasonably practicable following
Completion and in any case no later than the expiry of the Transitional
Services Agreement or the term for which Transitional Services are provided
pursuant to clause 19.6 (as applicable);  
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the contracts of employment of any employees of the Retained
Group who work predominantly or exclusively for the Aker Soho Business,
transfer to a member of the Group as soon as reasonably practicable following
the identification of any such employees; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | the contracts of employment of any employees of the Group
who work predominantly or exclusively for the Retained Group, transfer to a
member of the Retained Group as soon as reasonably practicable following the
identification of any such employees.

The parties shall share the costs of the strategy described in this clause
19.13, and with effect from Completion:



     | (i) | the Purchasers Representative undertakes to reimburse the
Sellers Representative in respect of the salary, and to indemnify the

---|--- 



   20.1 | The Sellers and the Purchasers shall jointly co-operate to
procure that, with effect from Completion, the benefit of the Brazil Projects
shall be assigned by the relevant member of the Retained Group to a member of
the Purchasers Group nominated by the Purchasers Representative.

   20.2 | In consideration for and following the assignment referred to in
clause 20.1, the Purchasers undertake to discharge or procure the discharge of
the obligations of any member of the Retained Group in respect of the Brazil
Projects. 
---|--- 



   20.3 | If the Brazil Projects have not been assigned to a member of the
Group or the Purchasers Group designated by the Purchasers Representative by
Completion, the Sellers shall procure that the relevant members of the
Retained Group enter into arrangements with the designated member of the Group
or the Purchasers Group, which shall remain effective until the date on which
the Brazil Projects may be assigned to such member of the Group or the
Purchasers Group and which shall provide (at the choice of the Purchasers
Representative, to the extent that the terms of the Brazil Projects allow)
either that: 
---|--- 
 



     | (A) | the Sellers shall procure that the relevant members of the
Retained Group discharge their obligations in respect of the Brazil Projects
and the Purchasers shall reimburse the relevant members of the Retained Group
in respect of all costs and expenses incurred by them in discharging their
obligations pursuant to this clause 20.3(A), provided that all such costs and
expenses are incurred through the good faith management by the relevant
members of the Retained Group of the Brazil Projects; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the Purchasers shall discharge or procure the discharge of
the obligations of any members of the Retained Group under the Brazil
Projects. 
---|---|--- 
 



   20.4 | The Purchasers shall severally indemnify the Sellers

losses, liabilities, claims, demands, causes of action, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) from any loss caused by any breach by

In consideration of the Purchasers agreeing to purchase the Shares from the

Sellers or any member of the Retained Group of any of their obligations,
commitments and undertakings under or pursuant to this Agreement and the Share
Purchase Documents. The liability of the Seller Guarantor under this Agreement
and the Share Purchase Documents shall not be released or diminished by
any variation of the terms of this Agreement or any other Share Purchase
Document (whether or not agreed by the Seller Guarantor), any forbearance,
neglect or delay in seeking performance of the obligations hereby imposed or
any granting of time for such performance.

performance of) and satisfy (or procure satisfaction of) the obligation,
commitment or undertaking in regard to which such default has been made in the

any other document referred to in it or them and so that the same benefits
shall be conferred on the Purchasers as would have been received if such
obligation, commitment or undertaking had been duly performed and satisfied by
the Sellers or the relevant member of the Retained Group. 
---|--- 
 



   21.3 | This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and, accordingly,
is to remain in force until all of the obligations of the Sellers and/or the
members of the Retained Group under this Agreement and/or any of the Share
Purchase Documents shall have been performed or satisfied, regardless of the
legality, validity or enforceability of any provisions of this Agreement or
any of the Share Purchase Documents and notwithstanding the winding-up,
liquidation, dissolution or other incapacity of any Seller or member of the
Retained Group or any change in the status, control or ownership of any Seller
or member of the Retained Group. The Purchasers may make claims and demands
of the Seller Guarantor without limit in number. This guarantee is in
addition to, without limiting and not in substitution for, any rights or
security which the Purchasers may now or after the date of this Agreement have
or hold for the performance and observance of the obligations, commitments
and undertakings of the Sellers under or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Share Purchase Document. 
---|---

any obligation, commitment or undertaking expressed to be undertaken by the
Sellers or any member of the Retained Group (including, without limitation,
any monies expressed to be payable under this Agreement) which may not be

or of the Purchasers or any other fact or circumstance (including any other
fact or circumstance whereby but for this provision the Seller Guarantor would
or might be discharged from liability under this clause 21) (other than any
limitation imposed by this Agreement or other Share Purchase Document) shall
nevertheless be enforceable against and recoverable from the Seller  

---|--- 
 



73  Guarantor as though the same had been incurred by the Seller Guarantor and
the Seller Guarantor were the sole or principal obligor in respect thereof and
shall be performed or paid by the Seller Guarantor on demand.

the Purchasers and, after Completion, any member of the Group, of all of their
obligations, commitments and undertakings under or pursuant to this Agreement
and the Share Purchase Documents (including its liabilities to pay any monies
under this Agreement and/or the Share Purchase Documents) and agrees to
indemnify the Sellers and any of the Sellers Indemnified Persons in respect
of any breach by the Purchasers or any member of the Group (after Completion)
of any of their obligations, commitments and undertakings under or pursuant to

Purchaser Guarantor under this Agreement and the Share Purchase Documents

the obligation, commitment or undertaking in regard to which such default has
been made in the manner prescribed by this Agreement or any of the Share
Purchase Documents or any other document referred to in it or them and so

received if such obligation, commitment or undertaking had been duly performed
and satisfied by the Purchasers or, after Completion, the relevant member of
the Group.  
---|--- 



   22.3 | This guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee and, accordingly,
is to remain in force until all of the obligations of the Purchasers and/or,
after Completion, the members of the Group under this Agreement and/or any of
the Share Purchase Documents shall have been performed or satisfied,
regardless of the legality, validity or enforceability of any provisions of
this Agreement or any of the Share Purchase Documents and notwithstanding the
winding-up, liquidation, dissolution or other incapacity of any Purchaser or,
after Completion, any member of the Group or any change in the status, control
or ownership of any Purchaser or, after Completion, any member of the Group.
The Sellers may make claims and demands of the Purchaser Guarantor without
limit in number. This guarantee is in addition to, without limiting and not in
substitution for, any rights or security which the Sellers may now or after
the date of this Agreement have or hold for the performance and observance of
the obligations, commitments and undertakings of the Purchasers under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Share Purchase Document. 
---|---

be undertaken by the Purchasers or, after Completion, any member of the Group
(including, without limitation, any monies expressed to be payable under this
Agreement) which may not be enforceable against or recoverable from the

circumstance (including any other fact or circumstance whereby but for this
provision the Purchaser Guarantor would or might be discharged from liability
under this clause 22) (other than any limitation imposed by this Agreement or

     | (B) | the Inter-Company Payables,

agent for the members of the Retained Group, and the Purchasers
Representative for itself and as agent for the members of the Group, shall
settle the amounts if any due in respect of the Inter-Company Receivables and
Inter-Company Payables as at Completion as follows: 
---|--- 
 



     | (A) | if the outstanding Inter-Company Receivables and the amounts
standing to the credit of any member of the Group in the Retained Groups cash
pooling arrangements are greater than the outstanding Inter-Company Payables
(in each case, following set off pursuant to clause 23.1 above), the Sellers
Representative shall pay an amount equal to the Net Inter-Company Balance as
at Completion (on behalf of the Sellers) to the Purchasers Representative
(on behalf of the Group); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | if the outstanding Inter-Company Payables are greater than

   23.5 | For the avoidance of doubt, the Inter-Company Trading Balances
will be settled by the relevant parties to them in the ordinary course of
trading, be that before or after Completion. 
---|--- 



   24. | Tail Insurance 
---|--- 



   24.1 | Until Completion, the Sellers shall maintain any existing
insurance policy which, as at the date of this Agreement, provides cover in
respect of any member of the Group, provided that the Sellers shall be
obliged only to maintain such cover as is generally available in the market on
terms which are commercially reasonable. 
---|--- 



   24.2 | The Sellers shall purchase tail third party liability insurance
cover (including both professional and public liability) (the "Tail
Insurance"):  
---|--- 



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  

(A) which takes effect from Completion;

 



 

(B) which as far as reasonably practicable shall be equivalent to, or
an extension of, the coverage provided by the Sellers current annual
professional indemnity and general liability/third party liability insurance
policies maintained by the Aker Soho Business, which tail cover will entitle
the Aker Soho Business and Purchasers Group to coverage in respect of
certain errors, omissions or liabilities of the Aker Soho Business or asserted
against any member of the Group or the Purchasers Group which took place or
arose in respect of matters which occurred prior to Completion where a claim
is made in writing to insurers within a period of five (5) years following the
Completion Date;

 |  |  |  | 
   | 
  

(C) which would be for individual claims or a series of claims arising

individual claim made under the Tail Insurance;

 |  |  | * | 
   | 
  

(D) with an aggregate cap on all claims for the entire five (5) year

(E) which will have no retroactive date; and

 



 

(F) which shall not be eroded or exhausted by claims against parties
other than members of the Purchasers Group in respect of the Aker Soho
Business.

 |  |  |  | 



   24.3 | Pursuant to the Tail Insurance: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | the Sellers Representative shall select the insurers and
structure of the tail insurance program (after prior consultation with the
Purchasers Representative). Such insurers may include members of the
Retained Group 
---|---|--- 

* Confidential Treatment Requested 

 



76  (whether such persons are insurers or are assuming the role of an insurer
for the purposes of the Tail Insurance); 

---|--- 
 



     | (B) | the Sellers Representative may, prior to Completion, at its
election substitute external insurers with a captive insurance company (either
by way of direct insurance or reinsurance of the existing insurance) or
itself or other members of the Retained Group subject always to the Seller
Guarantor guaranteeing the obligations of such captive insurance company or
other member of the Retained Group in accordance with clause 24.4; 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | cover shall be issued to the members of the Group, and the

Representative or a member of the Purchasers Group nominated by it shall be
named as an additional insured;

     | (D) | the Sellers and the Purchasers recognise that the insurance
markets have demanded certain amendments of substance (including coverage
restrictions) to the wordings of policies currently maintained in respect of
the Aker Soho Business which will be implemented in the Tail Insurance. The
parties will use all reasonable commercial efforts to minimise the extent of
such amendments. The policy forms containing such amendments as at the date
of this Agreement are set out in Appendix 8 (Policy forms); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (E) | the claims counsel in respect of any claims thereunder shall
be the current claims counsel in respect of the Sellers current policies,
being CMS Cameron McKenna, or such other reputable firm as may be agreed
between the Sellers Representative and the Purchasers Representative,
provided that such other firm is experienced in handling insurance claims
equivalent to those brought under the Tail Insurance and is independent of
both the Sellers and the Purchasers. 
---|---|--- 



   24.4 | For the avoidance of doubt, if a member of the Retained Group
has any obligations to make any payments to a member of the Purchasers Group
in its capacity as an insurer or in the role of an insurer under the Tail
Insurance in accordance with clauses 24.3(A) or (B), such obligations shall be
guaranteed by the Seller Guarantor in accordance with clause 21 (Seller
Guarantee).

(at the Purchasers expense) assist the Purchasers in obtaining coverage and

following Completion. The Purchasers acknowledge that the terms of policies
issued by way of "front" to any of the Retained Groups global insurance
programmes are likely to prohibit such transfer. 
---|--- 



   25.3 | The Purchasers shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that
(at the Sellers expense), immediately following Completion, the Retained
Group shall retain the benefit of and have access to any insurance policy
written on an occurrence basis covering any member of the Retained Group
(other than the members of the Group) prior to Completion, including for
claims that are reported following Completion. The Purchasers shall (at the
Sellers expense) assist the Sellers in obtaining coverage and payment for any
such claims by the relevant insurers and shall: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | at the Sellers request, provide the Sellers with all
relevant details of the relevant policies; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (B) | forward all communications received by it or any member of
the Purchasers Group in respect of the same to the Sellers. 
---|---|--- 
 



   25.4 | The Purchasers shall (at the Sellers expense) procure that,
where the terms of such policy allow, any insurance policy in the name of any
member of the Group which relates exclusively to one or more members of the
Retained Group shall be transferred to the relevant member of the Retained
Group following Completion. 
---|--- 



   25.5 | The Purchasers shall, in respect of the Retained Groups workers
compensation and automobile liability cover in the United States: 
---|--- 
 



     | (A) | procure that the relevant member of the Group reimburses any
payment in respect of a deductible/excess under such policies to the extent
that such deductible/excess relates to claims relating to a member of the
Group following Completion;

     | (B) | allow the Sellers insurance carriers for such policies
(currently Liberty Mutual), reasonable access to the Books and Records of the
Group reasonably required by such insurance carriers to allow for retroactive
true-up of premiums and division of advances which are within the relevant
policy excesses (and any premiums returned to a member of the Group which are
properly for the account of a member of the Retained Group shall be passed on
to the Sellers Representative, and any premiums returned to a member of the
Retained Group which are properly for the account of a member of the Group
shall be passed on to the Purchasers Representative); and  
---|---|--- 



     | (C) |

co-operate to the extent reasonably required by the Sellers or their insurance
carriers to divide any collateral requirements in respect of such policies in
a fair and reasonable way between the Group and the Retained Group. It is 

---|---|--- 
 



78  acknowledged that such collateral requirements currently amount to US$
7,500,000 for the United States of America operations of the Retained Group
(including the Group).  

---|--- 



   26. | Leases 
---|--- 



   26.1 | The Sellers and the Purchasers shall comply with, or shall
procure the compliance with, the provisions of Schedule 12 (Unassigned

159 Schedule 10

(Accounts Rule Book)



   1. | Introduction 
---|--- 



   1.1 | The Completion Accounts shall be prepared in accordance with: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | paragraph 2 of this Schedule 10; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | to the extent not covered by (A), the accounting principles
and practices adopted by the Aker Soho Business in the preparation of the
Reference Date Accounts as consistently applied by the Aker Soho Business on
a legal entity by legal entity basis; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | to the extent not covered by (A) and (B), in accordance with
IFRS as adopted by the EU. 
---|---|--- 
 

For the avoidance of doubt, paragraph (A) shall take precedence over
paragraphs (B) and (C), and paragraph (B) shall take precedence over
paragraph (C).



   1.2 | The Reference Date Accounts have been prepared using the same
principles (disregarding the references to the Reference Date Accounts and to
paragraph 2.25 of this Schedule 10). 
---|--- 



   1.3 | Any judgments required to be made in the preparation of the
Completion Accounts should be made in accordance with the practices applied in
the preparation of the Reference Date Accounts, for the avoidance of doubt,
without prejudice to the underlying facts and circumstances on which judgment
is to be exercised and the principles and practices applied. 
---|--- 
 



   2. | Specific accounting policies, principles and practices 
---|--- 



   2.1 | Revenue recognition  percentage of completion methods for
contracts 
---|--- 



     | (A) | Construction contracts 
---|---|--- 

Revenue recognition policies will be as follows:



     | (i) | Engineering and construction contract revenues are
recognised using the percentage of completion method, based primarily on
contract cost incurred to date compared to estimated total contract costs.
When the final outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract
revenue is recognised only to the extent of costs incurred that are expected
to be recoverable. Losses on contracts are fully recognised when identified. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

Contract revenues include variation orders and incentive bonuses when it is
probable that they will result in revenue and the amount can be measured
reliably. Disputed amounts are recognised when their realisation is probable
and can be measured reliably. Contract costs 

---|---|--- 
 



160  include costs that relate directly to the specific contract and costs that
are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the
contract. Costs that cannot be attributed to contract activity are expensed.
Bidding costs are capitalised when it is probable that the relevant member of
the Group will be the preferred bidder. All other bidding costs are expensed
as incurred. 

---|--- 
 



     | (B) | Goods sold and services rendered 
---|---|--- 

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement in
proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the date on which
Completion takes place. The stage of completion is normally assessed as the
proportion that cost incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated
contract costs. No revenue is recognised if there are significant
uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or
the possible return of goods also continuing management involved with the
goods.

 



   2.2 | With respect to intangible and tangible fixed assets there shall
be no write-offs or write-downs of historical costs in respect to such
intangible or tangible fixed assets other than for the events set out below

---|---|--- 



     | (B) | property, plant and equipment shall be valued at purchase

percentages (reflecting estimated useful lives of these assets) as applied
for the twelve month period ending on the Reference Date. 
---|---|--- 



   2.3 | All leasing contracts shall be accounted for as operating leases
to the extent that such leases have been accounted for as operating leases in
the Data Book and the Reference Date Accounts and the charge for such
operating lease has been reflected within EBITDA. Lease contracts entered into
after the Reference Date shall be capitalised if the lease term is greater
than 75% of the propertys estimated economic life; the lease contains an
option to purchase the property for less than fair market value; ownership of
the property is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term; or the
present value of the lease payments exceeds 90% of the fair market value of
the property or the lease falls to be capitalised by applying consistent
practices with those adopted in the Reference Date Accounts. All other lease
contracts entered into after the Reference Date shall be defined as operating
leases.  
---|--- 



   2.4 | Buildings shall be classified in the same manner as they were in
the Reference Date Accounts and shall be valued at purchase price, reduced
only by ordinary straight line depreciation. 
---|---

Aker Soho Business to the extent these principles and practices have been
adopted in the Reference Date Accounts.

less any provision for slow moving, obsolete or damaged goods. The provision
for slow moving, obsolete or damaged goods shall be calculated using the same
principles and practices as applied by the Aker Soho Business for the twelve
(12) month period ending at the Reference Date providing that this is
consistent with principles and practices adopted in the Reference Date
Accounts. 
---|--- 



   2.7 | Accounts receivable shall be valued at the invoice value less any
provisions for bad or doubtful debt. 
---|--- 
 



   2.8 | The bad debt provisions shall be calculated based on the same

practices with those adopted in the Reference Date Accounts.

Completion. 
---|--- 
 



   2.14 | The corporation Tax liability shall be calculated consistently
with principles and practices adopted in the Reference Date Accounts meaning
that the relevant corporate Tax rate shall be applied to net profits before
Taxes and shall in that respect take into account the effects of utilising Tax
attributes in the Group and the Retained Group and any Tax refund receivables
in the Group as a means to minimise the corporation Tax liability as at the
date of Completion. For the avoidance of doubt: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | the corporation Tax liability shall also take into
consideration any prepaid corporation Taxes and any rights to repayment due
from the Tax Authorities related to corporation Taxes; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) |

any corporation Tax which has not been assessed or which is not to be accrued
pursuant to the above, including without limitation any contingent

162  Tax liabilities, shall be disregarded, it being acknowledged that such
liabilities shall be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the Tax
Covenant.

Completion Accounts.

 



   2.15 | Net pension liabilities in respect of the Pension Schemes in the

   2.21 | Other long-term liabilities shall be valued using consistent
principles and practices with those adopted in the Reference Date Accounts. 
---|--- 
 



   2.22 | The preparation of the aggregation of the Aker Soho Business
Completion Accounts as at the Completion Date shall be on the same basis and
using equivalent methodology as in the Reference Date Accounts. 
---|--- 



   2.23 | Working Capital items shall be included using the same
principles and practices using the same definition as applied in the
definition of working capital in Hyperion in 2010, being the following line
items: 
---|--- 



     | (A) | 15000 Total current operating assets; and 
---|---|---

be reduced by US $2,500,000 in the Completion Accounts, the parties having
