against Parent in accordance with its terms, in each case subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium and similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

                  (b) Each Seller,  other than Parent,  has the requisite  power

against  such  Seller in  accordance  with its  terms,  in each case  subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium and similar laws of general
application  relating to or affecting  creditors'  rights and to general  equity
principles.

qualification,  and nothing has  occurred,  whether by action or failure to act,
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification;  (iv)

reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

any Company  shall be required to furnish or otherwise  make  available to Buyer
customer-specific data or competitively  sensitive information relating to areas

without the  specific  prior  authorization  of Parent.  Buyer  agrees that such

                  SECTION  7.2   PRESERVE   ACCURACY  OF   REPRESENTATIONS   AND
WARRANTIES; NOTIFICATION. Each of Buyer and Parent shall refrain from taking any

otherwise  challenge  the  legality  of any  transaction  contemplated  by  this
Agreement.  Each party  hereto shall  promptly  notify the other of any lawsuit,
claim, proceeding or investigation that may be threatened,  brought, asserted or
commenced against any Company or Buyer, as the case may be, that would have been
listed in SCHEDULE  5.13 or SCHEDULE  6.3, as the case may be, if such  lawsuit,
claim, proceeding or investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof.

                  SECTION 7.3 CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES; GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS.

any significant  amounts of money,  commence or participate in any litigation or
offer or grant any  accommodation  (financial  or otherwise) to any third party;
and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Buyer shall not be obligated hereunder to divest (x)
any portion of the  Business or (y) any of its assets owned prior to the Closing
Date.  The proviso  that the  parties not be required to expend any  significant
amounts of money shall not be construed so as to limit the parties' responses to
requests  by  Governmental  Bodies for  additional  information  or  documentary
material.  Parent and Buyer shall  cooperate fully with each other to the extent
reasonable in connection with the foregoing.

                  (b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than
10 business  days,  after the date hereof,  Buyer and Parent shall file with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
the notifications  and other information  required to be filed under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions  contemplated  hereby. Each of Buyer and Parent
agrees to make available to the other such information relative to its business,
assets and property as the other may reasonably  request in order to prepare HSR
filings.  Each of Buyer and  Parent  agrees to keep the  other  apprised  of the
status  and  substance  of all  actions  or  communications  between  it (or its
advisors) and any such agency  relating to this  Agreement or any of the matters

                  (b)  Notwithstanding  SECTION  7.4(A),  except as set forth in
SCHEDULE  7.4,  except as  contemplated  by this  Agreement  or except  with the

Parent,  and shall be conducted so as not to interfere  with, or shall take into
consideration,  the use and  operation  of the  Downers  Grove Real  Property by
Parent or its tenants,  subtenants,  licensees or other occupants of the Downers

any Losses and Expenses  incurred by such Parent Group Member  arising out of or
resulting from the inspection of the Downers Grove Real Property by Buyer or its
agents or  consultants,  and  notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in this
Agreement,  such  obligation to indemnify and hold harmless Parent shall survive
the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

                  (ii)   Notwithstanding   anything   contained  herein  to  the
contrary,  if as a  result  of  physical  inspections  performed  under  SECTION
7.10(B)(I),  Buyer determines that it will expend any amounts as a result of (a)
a violation of any laws, codes, regulations,  rules or ordinances (including the
Americans  With  Disabilities  Act)  with  respect  to the  Downers  Grove  Real
Property,  (b) the presence of any Contaminant  (including  asbestos or asbestos
containing  materials) on the Downers Grove Real  Property,  (c) any  structural
defect  with  respect  to any  improvements  located on the  Downers  Grove Real
Property which a commercially  reasonable  office building buyer would repair or
replace  within  three  years  after the Closing  Date,  or (d) any  mechanical,
electrical, plumbing, sewer, heating, air conditioning, sprinkler or life safety
system at the Downers Grove Real Property which a commercially reasonable office
building  buyer would replace  within three years after the Closing Date,  Buyer
will provide written notice (the "DEFECT NOTICE") to Parent within five business
days of expiration of the 30-day inspection period referenced in (b)(i) above of
the amounts (collectively the "DEFECT AMOUNT") which Buyer has determined (based
upon  inspections  performed  by or on behalf of Buyer)  will be  expended  as a
result of (a)-(d)  above,  together with a written  description  of the items to
which the Defect Amount applies and  sufficient  supporting  documentation  from
Buyer's  inspection to enable Parent to verify the Defect  Amount.  If Buyer and
Parent do not  agree on the  Defect  Amount,  Parent  shall so  notify  Buyer in
writing within five business days of receipt of the Defect Notice by Parent,  in
which  event Buyer and Parent  shall refer the matter to  inspectors/consultants
mutually  acceptable to Buyer and Parent experienced in the matters to which the
Defect Amount  applies,  whose  determination  with respect to the Defect Amount
shall be  final.  If  Parent  fails to  provide  timely  notice  to Buyer of its
objection to the Defect Amount, Buyer's determination of the Defect Amount shall
be final.

                  Buyer and Parent  agree  that the amount of the Defect  Amount
shall be allocated among Buyer and Parent as follows:

                  (1) Buyer shall be responsible for the first $1,000,000 of the
amount of the Defect Amounts; and

                  (2) all amounts of the Defect  Amount in excess of  $1,000,000
shall be shared equally between Buyer and Parent.

                  Provided  that the Closing has  occurred,  within ten business
days of the  determination  of the Defect Amount,  Parent shall pay to Buyer any
amounts of the Defect Amount for which Parent is responsible under (2) above.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

                  SECTION  8.1 USE OF  NAMES.  (a)  Except  as  provided  in the
Trademark  License  Agreements,  Parent  is not  conveying  ownership  rights or
granting to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any Company a license to use any of
the  tradenames  or  trademarks of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (other than

the  Companies or any  Affiliate of the Companies to use in any manner the names
or marks of Parent or any  Affiliate  of Parent or any word that is  confusingly
similar in sound or appearance to such names or marks. If Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer violates any of its  obligations  under this SECTION 8.1, after written
notice and failure to cease and desist  promptly,  Parent and its Affiliates may
proceed  against  it in law or in equity for such  damages or other  relief as a
court may deem appropriate.  Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this SECTION
8.1 may  cause  Parent  and its  Affiliates  irreparable  harm  which may not be
adequately  compensated for by money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the
event of any actual or threatened  violation of this SECTION 8.1, Parent and its
Affiliates shall be entitled,  in addition to other remedies that they may have,
to seek a temporary  restraining  order and to preliminary and final  injunctive
relief  against  Buyer or such  Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any  violations of
this SECTION 8.1,  without the necessity of proving  actual damages or posting a
bond. If not done by Parent prior to the Closing, Buyer shall cause each Company
to  file  to  change  its  name  to a  name  that  does  not  include  the  word
"ServiceMaster"  or any confusingly  similar variation thereof no later than ten
business days after the Closing Date.

                  (b) Prior to the  Closing,  Parent  shall  execute  the United
States and Canada Trademark License Agreement  granting SMMSLP the right to use,
and the  right to  sublicense  to  Aviation  LP and MS  Canada  the use of,  the
"ServiceMaster"  name (the "MARK") in connection with the Business  conducted by
SMMSLP, Aviation LP and MS Canada (collectively, the "MARK USERS") in the United
States and  Canada.  Notwithstanding  any of the terms of the United  States and
Canada Trademark License  Agreement,  Buyer hereby agrees to cause (i) SMMSLP to
present to Parent no later than the first anniversary of the Closing Date a plan
to  transition,  during the  succeeding  two years,  to a new name to be used in
connection  with the Business  conducted by the Mark Users in the United  States
and Canada,  such plan to include  the choice of the new name and a  co-branding
strategy,  (ii) the Health Care and Education  divisions,  as constituted on the
Closing Date, of SMMSLP and MS Canada to cease all use of the Mark no later than
the  third  anniversary  of the  Closing  Date,  and  (iii)  the  divisions,  as
constituted on the Closing Date, of SMMSLP and MS Canada,  other than the Health
Care and  Education  divisions,  and Aviation LP to cease all use of the Mark no
later than the second anniversary of the Closing Date.

Company  having been a member of a group of  corporations  joining in filing Tax
Returns on

HEA Membership  Interests or the SMMSLP LP Interests,  in each case described in
this  clause  (B) for any  taxable  year or period  that  ends on or before  the
Closing  Date and,  with  respect to any  Straddle  Period,  the portion of such
Straddle  Period ending on and including  the Closing Date,  (C) arising  solely
from  the  termination,  as of the  Closing  Date,  of  any  Company  that  is a
corporation as a member of the  affiliated  group (as defined in Section 1504 of
the Code) of which  Parent  is the  parent  corporation,  (D)  arising  from the
distribution  of or otherwise  relating to the  Excluded  Assets or the Excluded
Business or (E) that are  Section  338(h)(10)  Taxes;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that

Companies  Subsidiary,  or that result from Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any
Company  engaging in any activity or transaction  (other than the activities and
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement) that would cause the  transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets of
any Company (other than HEA) for federal, state or local Tax purposes,  (II) any
Taxes (other than Section  338(h)(10)  Taxes) imposed on any Company,  for which
any  Company  may  otherwise  be liable or with  respect  to the HEA  Membership
Interests or the SMMSLP LP Interests as a result of actual  transactions  not in
the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing,
and (III) any Taxes shown as a liability  or reserve on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and not excluded as a liability in  determining  Net Working  Capital (the
Taxes described in this proviso being referred to as "EXCLUDED  TAXES").  Parent
shall be  entitled  to any refund of (or actual  credit for when and as actually
realized) Taxes for which it is liable under this SECTION 8.2(A).

                  (ii)  Buyer  shall be  liable  for and pay,  and  pursuant  to
ARTICLE XI shall  indemnify  and hold harmless each Parent Group Member from and
against, any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by such Parent Group Member in
connection  with or  arising  from,  (A) any and all  Taxes  imposed  on or with
respect to any Company,  for which any Company may otherwise be liable,  or with
respect to the HEA Membership Interests or the SMMSLP LP Interests, in each case
described  in this clause (A) for any taxable  year or period that begins  after
the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle  Period,  the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date and (B) Excluded Taxes.  Except
as  otherwise  provided  herein,  Buyer  shall be  entitled to any refund of (or
actual  credit  for when and as  actually  realized)  (x)  Taxes for which it is
liable under this SECTION 8.2(A) and (y) any Tax  receivables  shown as an asset
on the Closing  Date Balance  Sheet and not excluded as an asset in  determining
Net Working Capital.

                  (iii) For purposes of SECTIONS 8.2(A)(I) and (A)(II), whenever
it is  necessary  to  determine  the  liability  for Taxes of a Company  or with
respect  to the HEA  Membership  Interests  or the  SMMSLP  LP  Interests  for a
Straddle Period, the determination of such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period


                                       49
<PAGE>


consisted of two taxable  years or periods,  one which ended at the close of the
Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the
Closing  Date,  and items of  income,  gain,  deduction,  loss or credit of such
Company  or with  respect  to the HEA  Membership  Interests  or the  SMMSLP  LP
Interests  for the Straddle  Period shall be allocated  between such two taxable
years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of
such Company were closed at the close of the Closing  Date;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that (I)  transactions  not in the ordinary course of business  occurring on the
Closing Date after the Closing shall be treated as occurring in the taxable year
or period  that is deemed to begin at the  beginning  of the day  following  the
Closing Date and (II)  exemptions,  allowances or deductions that are calculated
on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

                  (iv) Parent shall cause all  obligations of each Company under
any Tax Sharing  Agreement  to which such  Company has been a party prior to the
Closing  Date  (other  than any  such  obligations  to  another  Company)  to be
terminated on or before the Closing Date, and shall  indemnify and hold harmless
any Buyer Group  Member with respect to such a Tax Sharing  Agreement  after the
Closing Date.

Downers  Grove Real  Property) and subject to clause (I) of the first proviso of
SECTION  8.2(A)(I),  but  otherwise   notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the
contrary, Buyer and Parent shall each pay one-half (and shall indemnify and hold
harmless  the other party if such other party shall pay more than  one-half)  of
any real property  transfer or gains tax,  sales tax, use tax,  stamp tax, stock
transfer tax, or other similar tax imposed on the  transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that such taxes imposed on the distribution
of or otherwise  relating to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded  Business shall
be the sole liability of Parent.

associated with the Downers Grove Real Property shall be allocated between the
parties in a manner consistent with the proration of income and expenses
pursuant to SECTION 3.5.

timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (x)
all Income Tax Returns  required to be filed by or with  respect to each Company
for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including all
Income Tax  Returns  required to be filed with  respect to any of the  Companies
that for purposes of the relevant Income Tax Return is a disregarded entity or a
partnership, in each case for taxable years or periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date) and (y) to the extent not described in clause (x), all Tax Returns
required to be filed with respect to any of the  Companies  and due on or before
the Closing Date, and in each case Parent shall remit,  or cause to be remitted,
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax  Returns,  and Buyer  shall  timely file or
cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all  extensions  properly
obtained) all other Tax Returns with respect to taxable years or periods  ending
on or before the Closing Date or that relate to any Straddle Period in each case
that are  required  to be filed by or with  respect to each  Company,  and Buyer
shall  remit,  or cause to be  remitted,  any Taxes due in  respect  of such Tax
Returns.  With  respect  to Tax  Returns  to be filed by Buyer  pursuant  to the
preceding  sentence that relate to taxable years or periods  ending on or before
the Closing Date or that relate

                                       50
<PAGE>


to any Straddle Period (I) except as otherwise required by law, such Tax Returns
shall be filed in a manner  consistent  with past practice and no position shall
be taken,  election made or method adopted that is  inconsistent  with positions
taken,  elections  made or  methods  used in prior  periods  in filing  such Tax
Returns  (including any such  position,  election or method which would have the
effect of accelerating income to periods for which Parent is liable or deferring
deductions to periods for which Buyer is liable) and (II) such Tax Returns shall
be  submitted  to Parent not later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within 45 days  following  the Closing
Date,  as promptly as  practicable  following  the Closing  Date) for review and
approval by Parent, which approval may not be unreasonably  withheld, but may in
all cases be withheld if such Tax Returns were not prepared in  accordance  with
clause (I) of this  sentence.  With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by Parent
under this SECTION  8.2(B)(I),  except where  required by law,  such Tax Returns
shall not be filed by Parent in a manner  inconsistent  with past practice,  and
Parent shall not take any position,  make any election, or adopt any method that
is inconsistent  with positions  taken,  elections made or methods used in prior
periods in filing Tax Returns (including any such position, election or a method
which  would have the effect of  accelerating  deductions  to periods  for which
Parent is liable or deferring  income to periods for which Buyer is liable),  in
each case,  if doing so would  result in material  adverse Tax  consequences  to
Buyer Group Members with respect to taxable years or periods beginning after the
Closing  Date or,  with  respect to any  Straddle  Period,  the  portion of such
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.  Parent or Buyer shall pay the
other  party for the Taxes for which  Parent or Buyer,  respectively,  is liable
pursuant to SECTION 8.2(A) but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed
by the other party pursuant to this SECTION  8.2(B) upon the written  request of
the party  entitled to payment,  setting forth in detail the  computation of the
amount owed by Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, but in no event earlier than
10 business days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes.

                  (ii) None of Buyer or any  Affiliate  of Buyer shall (or shall
cause or permit any Company to) amend,  refile or otherwise  modify (or grant an
extension of any statute of limitation  with respect to) any Tax Return relating
in whole or in part to any Company  with  respect to any taxable  year or period
ending on or before the Closing Date (or with  respect to any  Straddle  Period)
without the prior  written  consent of Parent,  which consent may be withheld in
the sole discretion of Parent.

                  (iii) Buyer shall  promptly  cause each Company to prepare and
provide to Parent a package of Tax information  materials,  including  schedules
and work papers  (the "TAX  PACKAGE"),  reasonably  required by Parent to enable
Parent to prepare and file all Tax Returns  required to be prepared and filed by
it  pursuant  to  SECTION  8.2(B)(I).  The Tax  Package  shall be  completed  in
accordance  with past  practice,  including  past practice as to providing  such
information  and as to the method of computation  of separate  taxable income or
other  relevant  measure of income of such  Company.  Buyer  shall cause the Tax
Package to be delivered to Parent within 45 days after the Closing Date.

                  (c) CONTEST PROVISIONS. (i) Buyer shall promptly notify Parent
in writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any Company of notice
of any  pending or  threatened  federal,  state,  local or foreign  Tax  audits,
examinations  or assessments  which might affect the Tax  liabilities  for which
Parent may be liable  pursuant to this  SECTION 8.2;  PROVIDED,

                                       51
<PAGE>


that  failure to give notice  pursuant to this  SECTION  8.2(C)(I)  will have no
effect on the  indemnification  obligations under SECTION 8.2(A),  except to the
extent such failure materially  prejudices the party entitled to notice.  Parent
shall have the sole right to represent each Company's interests in any Tax audit
or administrative or court proceeding  relating to Taxes for which Parent may be
liable  pursuant to this SECTION 8.2, and to employ counsel of its choice at its
expense;  PROVIDED,  that  without  the prior  written  consent of Buyer,  which
consent may be withheld in the sole  discretion of Buyer,  Parent may not settle
any  such  claim  if such  settlement  would  result  in  material  adverse  Tax
consequences  to Buyer Group  Members with  respect to taxable  years or periods
beginning  after the Closing Date or, with respect to any Straddle  Period,  the
portion of such Straddle  Period  beginning  after the Closing  Date;  PROVIDED,
FURTHER,  that in no case  shall  Buyer  withhold  consent  where  Parent  shall
indemnify  Buyer,  in a  manner  (and  amount)  then  determined  by Buyer to be
reasonably acceptable, for the increase in tax liability to Buyer resulting from
such settlement.

                  (ii) In the case of any pending or threatened federal,  state,
local or  foreign  Tax  audits,  examinations  or  assessments  pertaining  to a
Straddle  Period  with  respect to which  Parent  and Buyer both have  liability
pursuant to SECTION  8.2(A),  Buyer shall have the sole right to represent  each
Company's interests in any such audit or proceeding; PROVIDED, that Parent shall
be entitled to participate at its expense in such audit or proceeding, and, with
the written consent of Buyer and at Parent's sole expense, may assume the entire
control of such audit or proceeding

                  (iii) None of Buyer,  any of its Affiliates or any Company may
settle any Tax claim for any Taxes for which  Parent may be liable  pursuant  to
SECTION 8.2(A) without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may be
withheld  in the sole  discretion  of  Parent,  PROVIDED,  that in no case shall
Parent  withhold  consent where Buyer shall indemnify  Parent,  in a manner then
determined  by Parent  to be  reasonably  acceptable,  for the  increase  in Tax
liability to Parent resulting from such settlement.

                  (d) SMHC or Parent, as the case may be, and Buyer shall file a
joint election for each of CMIG,  SMDMC,  KDA, QRC, and SMMS, Inc. under Section
338(h)(10)  of the  Code  with  respect  to the  purchase  by  Buyer  of all the
outstanding  shares  of  capital  stock  of  CMIG,  SMDMC,  QRC and  SMMS,  Inc.
(collectively,  the "SECTION 338(H)(10) ELECTIONS"). SMHC or Parent, as the case
may be, and Buyer  shall  exchange  completed  and  executed  copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form 8023,  required schedules  thereto,  and any similar state,
local,  foreign and other forms. If any changes are required in these forms as a
result of information  which is first  available after these forms are prepared,
the parties will  promptly  agree on such changes.  None of SMHC,  Parent or any
other  Seller  makes  any  warranty  or  representation   with  respect  to  the
effectiveness of the Section  338(h)(10)  Elections;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that,
assuming the effectiveness of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections,  nothing in this
sentence shall alter the extent to which Parent is liable for Section 338(h)(10)
Taxes in accordance with the terms of SECTION 8.2.

                  (e) ASSISTANCE AND  COOPERATION.  After the Closing Date, each
of Parent and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective  Affiliates to) take
reasonable steps to:


                                       52
<PAGE>


                  (i) assist the other party in preparing  any Tax Returns which
such other party is  responsible  for preparing  and filing in  accordance  with
SECTION 8.2(B);

                  (ii)  cooperate  fully in  preparing  for any  audits  of,  or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of each Company;

                  (iii) make available to the other and to any taxing  authority
as reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes
of each Company;

                  (iv)  provide  timely  notice to the other in  writing  of any
pending or  threatened  Tax audits or  assessments  of each  Company for taxable
periods for which the other may have a liability under this SECTION 8.2;

                  (v) In the case of Parent,  Parent shall promptly notify Buyer
in  writing  upon  receipt by Parent or any of its  Affiliates  of notice of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,  examinations
or assessments  relating to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
that might have a material  adverse Tax  consequence to Buyer Group Members with
respect to taxable  years or periods  beginning  after the Closing Date or, with
respect to any Straddle  Period,  the portion of such Straddle Period  beginning
after the Closing Date.

                  (vi)  furnish  the other  with  copies  of all  correspondence
received  from  any  taxing  authority  in  connection  with  any Tax  audit  or
information request with respect to any such taxable period;

                  (vii)  timely sign and deliver such  certificates  or forms as
may be necessary or  appropriate  to establish an exemption  from (or  otherwise
reduce),  or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes  described
in SECTION 8.2(A)(V) (relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

                  (viii)  timely  provide  to the other  powers of  attorney  or
similar authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this SECTION 8.2.

                  SECTION 8.3 EMPLOYEE  MATTERS.  (a) IN GENERAL.  Parent shall,
prior to, on or as soon as  practicable  after the Closing Date,  give notice to
all employees of the Companies (including employees who are not actively at work
on account of illness,  disability or leave of absence) on the Closing Date (the
"AFFECTED  EMPLOYEES")  that,  except as otherwise  provided herein,  the active
participation  of the Affected  Employees in the Parent Plans and Parent Foreign
Plans listed in  SCHEDULES  5.16(A) and 5.16(B)  shall  terminate on the Closing
Date.  Affected Employees shall be credited for their length of service with, or
credited by, Parent and the Companies for all purposes under any benefit plan or
program or fringe benefit made  available to Affected  Employees by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates after the Closing Date ("BUYER'S BENEFIT PROGRAMS"); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that  such  service  shall  not be so  credited  (i) for  purposes  of
calculating  accrued  benefits under a defined benefit pension plan, (ii) to the
extent the  service of  similarly  situated  employees  with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates  would  not  have  been so  credited,  or (iii)  to the  extent  that
crediting  such service would result in the  duplication  of either  benefits


                                       53
<PAGE>

or accruals to an Affected Employee. Except as specifically provided herein, the
Companies  shall terminate  their  participation  in the Parent Plans and Parent
Foreign Plans as of the Closing Date. The Companies shall be solely  responsible
for all obligations  and liabilities  under each Company Plan listed in SCHEDULE
5.16(A),  and no such obligations or liabilities shall be assumed or retained by
Parent or its Affiliates.  Except as  specifically  provided  herein,  after the
Closing Date, the Companies and Buyer shall have no obligation or liability with
respect to, and Parent and its Affiliates  shall be solely  responsible for, all
obligations  and  liabilities  under the Parent Plans and Parent  Foreign Plans.
Buyer shall not unreasonably  restrict the ability of Affected Employees to take
unused vacation prior to December 31, 2001.

                  (b) BONUSES. (i) Buyer shall cause the Companies to pay to the
Affected Employees,  to the extent not previously paid, the bonuses they have or
would have  accrued  through  the end of 2001 under the  Additional  Provisional
Compensation Plan maintained by Parent and the Companies  (regardless of whether
an Affected Employee is an employee of Buyer or any Company on the bonus payment
date). Such bonuses shall be paid at approximately the same time and in the same
manner as such bonuses are paid to employees of Parent and  Affiliates of Parent
and,  in any event,  as soon as  administratively  practicable  after the end of
2001. If the Closing Date occurs on or before  December 31, 2001,  then prior to
the Closing Parent shall estimate and  communicate to Buyer the aggregate  bonus
amounts payable under such Additional Provisional Compensation Plan with respect
to the full 2001 year,  and the Closing Date Balance  Sheet shall  reflect a pro
rata portion of such estimated  amounts,  to the extent not previously paid, for
the period  through and including the Closing Date. The amounts of such bonuses,
the  persons  to whom  payable,  and all  other  relevant  information  shall be
determined by Parent,  and  communicated  in writing by Parent to Buyer within a
reasonable period of time prior to the anticipated payment date of such bonuses.

                  (ii) Parent  shall pay to all Affected  Employees  the bonuses
earned,  without any amounts  being  deferred or held back,  under the Long Term
Performance  Award Plan  maintained by Parent and the Companies  (regardless  of
whether an  Affected  Employee  is an  employee  of Buyer or any  Company on the
payment date).  Such bonuses shall be paid at approximately the same time and in
the same manner as such bonuses are paid to  employees of Parent and  Affiliates
of Parent.  The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall not reflect any amounts accrued
for such payments.

                  (iii) Each Affected  Employee shall be eligible to participate
for the  portion of Buyer's  fiscal  year  beginning  January 1, 2002 and ending
September  30, 2002 in one or more bonus plans or programs  that are at least as
favorable as those made available to employees of Buyer with  comparable  levels
of  responsibility;  PROVIDED,  that the bonus  payable to an Affected  Employee
under  each such plan or program  shall be equal to 75% of the bonus  determined
under such plan or program for the full fiscal year.  If the Closing Date occurs
on or after  January 1, 2002,  then the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall reflect
the pro rata  accruals  through the Closing  Date of bonuses  earned by Affected
Employees  under the  Additional  Provisional  Compensation  Plan  maintained by
Parent and the Companies for the 2002 calendar year.



                                       54
<PAGE>

                  (iv) Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  Buyer
shall cause the  Companies to honor their  obligations  under all  Retention and
Severance Agreements listed in SCHEDULE 7.4; provided that Parent shall make any
payments  under such  agreements to the extent that in the aggregate they would,
if the  employment  of all Affected  Employees  terminated  on the Closing Date,
exceed $20 million.

                  (c) WELFARE BENEFITS.  Subject to SECTION 11.1(A)(VIII),  with
respect  to the  Affected  Employees,  after  the  Closing  Date,  Buyer and the
Companies  shall have the liability and  obligation  for, and neither Parent nor
any of its  Affiliates  shall have any  liability  or  obligation  for:  (l) any
short-term  disability,  sick pay, salary  continuation,  medical,  dental, life
insurance,  long-term  disability or other welfare benefit claims incurred after
the Closing  Date;  and (2) any  short-term  disability,  sick pay,  medical and
dental benefit claims  incurred prior to or on the Closing Date. For purposes of
this SECTION 8.3(C), a claim shall be deemed incurred  (whether or not reported)
when (i) with  respect to medical  and dental  benefits,  the  medical or dental
services  giving rise to such  claims are  performed,  and (ii) with  respect to
life,  accident or  disability  benefits,  the events  giving rise to such claim
occurs. Any preexisting  condition clause in any of the Welfare Plans (including
medical, dental and disability coverage) included in Buyer's Benefit Programs in
which  Affected  Employees  are eligible to  participate  after the Closing Date
shall be waived for the Affected  Employees to the extent such  condition  would
have  been  waived  under  any  Welfare  Plan in which  such  Affected  Employee
participated  immediately  prior to the Closing  Date.  Buyer  shall  credit the
Affected  Employees  with any amounts paid under the Parent Plans on or prior to
the Closing Date toward  satisfaction of the applicable  deductible  amounts and
copayment  obligations  under the  corresponding  Welfare Plans of Buyer for the
plan year in which the Affected  Employees become eligible to participate in the
Welfare Plans of Buyer.

                  (d) COBRA.  Subject to SECTION  11.1(A)(VIII),  Buyer shall be
responsible  for  providing  any employee or former  employee of a Company whose
"qualifying  event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code,  occurs
prior  to,  on or  after  the  Closing  Date  (and  such  employees'  "qualified
beneficiaries"  within the  meaning of  Section  4980B(f)  of the Code) with the
continuation of group health coverage  required by Section  4980B(f) of the Code
("COBRA").

                  (e) SEVERANCE. As of the Closing Date, Buyer and the Companies
shall assume all liability and obligation for, and neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates  shall  have any  liability  or  obligation  for,  severance  pay and
obligations payable to any employee of a Company whose employment was terminated
at any  time  prior  to or on the  Closing  Date  to the  extent  such  pay  and
obligations  are  reflected on the Closing Date  Balance  Sheet.  Parent and its
Affiliates  shall have all liability and  obligation  for such severance pay and
obligations in excess of that  reflected on the Closing Date Balance  Sheet.  In
connection therewith,  for a period commencing on the day after the Closing Date
and ending no earlier than the last day of the second  calendar  year  beginning
after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to offer each Affected Employee, other than
employees  who are  parties to a Retention  and  Severance  Agreement  listed on
SCHEDULE 7.4, who is terminated during such period,  severance pay to the extent
consistent with and determined in accordance with the terms of Buyer's severance
plans, programs and policies set forth in SCHEDULE 8.3(E).



                                       55
<PAGE>


                  (f) RETIREE  BENEFITS.  After the Closing Date,  Buyer and the
Companies  shall have no liability  and  obligation  for, and the Parent and its
Affiliates  shall have all  liability  and  obligation  for,  providing  medical
reimbursement  benefits to former  employees of any Company who retire,  or have
retired, from such Company, and to their spouses, under Parent's Retiree Medical
Reimbursement  Plan or any other  Company  Plan or Parent  Plan,  other  than as
provided under SECTIONS 8.3(D) and (I).

                  (g) WARN. (i) Parent and its Affiliates shall not, at any time
within the 90-day period prior to the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing"
or "mass  layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN and similar state and local
rules,  statutes  and  ordinances,  affecting  in  whole  or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or employee of any of the Companies. Parent
agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for any claim,  action, suit, demand
or  proceeding  by an Affected  Employee  for back pay,  front pay,  benefits or
compensatory  or  punitive  damages,  any  claim  by any  governmental  unit for
penalties  regarding  any issue of prior  notification  (or lack thereof) of any
plant  closing or mass layoff,  occurring  prior to the Closing Date and Buyer's
costs, including costs of collection, attorneys fees and other costs of defense,
in defending such claims.

                  (ii)  Buyer and the  Companies  shall be  responsible  for all
liabilities  and  obligations  under WARN (and such similar rules,  statutes and
ordinances)  resulting  from the  actions or  inactions  of Buyer or any Company
after the Closing Date.  Buyer agrees to hold Parent  harmless for any breach of
such  responsibility  and  Buyer's  indemnification  of  Parent  in this  regard
specifically  includes any claim by the Affected  Employees for back pay,  front
pay, benefits or compensatory or punitive damages, any claim by any governmental
unit for penalties  regarding any issue of prior  notification (or lack thereof)
of any  plant  closing  or mass  layoff  occurring  after the  Closing  Date and
Parent's  costs,  including  reasonable  attorney's  fees, in defending any such
claims.

The indemnification provided under this SECTION 8.3(G) shall not be subject to
any of the limitations set forth in ARTICLE XI.

                  (h) WORKERS'  COMPENSATION.  Subject to Section 11.1(a)(viii),
Buyer and the Companies shall have the obligation and liability for any workers'
compensation or similar  workers'  protection  claims of any Affected  Employee,
whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date.

                  (i) FLEXIBLE  SPENDING  ACCOUNTS.  With respect to the year in
which the Closing occurs,  Buyer shall establish  flexible spending accounts for
medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan  established or
maintained  under  Section  125 and  Section  129 of the Code  ("BUYER'S  FSA"),
effective  as of the Closing  Date,  for each  Affected  Employee  who as of the
Closing  Date, is a participant  in a flexible  spending  account for medical or
dependent  care expenses under a Parent Plan pursuant to Section 125 and Section
129 of the Code  ("PARENT'S  FSA").  Buyer shall credit or debit, as applicable,
effective on the day after the Closing Date, the applicable account of each such
Affected  Employee under Buyer's FSA with an amount equal to the balance of each
such Affected  Employee's  account under Parent's FSA as of the Closing Date. As
soon as  administratively  practicable  after the Closing Date, the Parent

                                       56
<PAGE>


shall transfer to Buyer an amount equal to the total  contributions  made to the
Parent's  FSA by  Affected  Employees  in  respect of the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs, reduced by an amount equal to the total claims already paid
to Affected  Employees in respect of such plan year. To the extent  permitted by
law,  Buyer and Parent  intend  that the  actions to be taken  pursuant  to this
subsection  (i) be treated as an  assumption by Buyer of the portion of Parent's
FSA and the elections made thereunder attributable to Affected Employees.

                  (j) 401(K)  PLAN.  (i) After the Closing  Date,  but not later
than March 15, 2002, Parent shall, on behalf of the Companies,  make an employer
matching  contribution to Parent's Profit Sharing and Retirement Plan ("PARENT'S
SAVINGS  PLAN") for the 2001 plan year on behalf of each  Affected  Employee who
participated  in such plan during the 2001 plan year,  without regard to whether
the Closing  occurs on,  prior to or after  December  31,  2001.  Such  employer
matching  contributions shall be made at the rate generally  applicable to other
participants who are eligible for employer matching contributions under Parent's
Savings Plan, and shall take into account  elective  deferral  contributions  of
Affected  Employees  for 2001  prior  to the  Closing  Date.  On or prior to the
Closing  Date,  Parent shall take all actions  necessary to ensure that Affected
Employees'  accounts  under  Parent's  Savings  Plan are fully  vested as of the
Closing  Date.  The  Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet shall not reflect any amounts
accrued for contributions to Parent's Savings Plan as provided herein.

                  (ii) As of the day after the Closing  Date,  Buyer shall cause
Affected  Employees to be eligible to  participate  in a  tax-qualified  defined
contribution  plan  maintained by Buyer  ("BUYER'S  SAVINGS PLAN") to the extent
consistent with such plan's terms, including eligibility requirements.

                  (iii) The parties shall effectuate a  trust-to-trust  transfer
of the account balances of Affected Employees under Parent's Savings Plan to the
Buyer's  Savings Plan  designated by Buyer,  as follows.  As soon as practicable
after the  Closing  Date,  but no later  than 180 days after the  Closing  Date,
Parent shall cause the account of each  Affected  Employee who  participates  in
Parent's  Savings  Plan to be valued  pursuant to the terms of Parent's  Savings
Plan. As of such valuation date, assets equal in value to the amount credited to
each such  Affected  Employee's  account  under  Parent's  Savings  Plan will be
transferred to the trust maintained under Buyer's Savings Plan. Such transferred
assets  shall be in cash  (except  for  shares  of Parent  common  stock and any
promissory notes evidencing outstanding loan balances of the Affected Employees,
which shall be  transferred  in kind),  and shall be in accordance  with Section
414(l) of the Code. Prior to, and as a condition of, any transfer of assets each
party  shall  provide  the other  with  satisfactory  evidence  that its plan is
tax-qualified  within  the  meaning  of  Section  401(a) of the Code.  As of the
transfer date,  Buyer's Savings Plan will have sole liability for the payment of
benefits  accrued by the  Affected  Employees  under  Parent's  Savings Plan and
transferred in respect of such employees.  During the 24-month period  beginning
on the  consummation  of such transfer (or such shorter period as required under
applicable  law),  the  shares of Parent  Common  Stock  transferred  to Buyer's
Savings Plan  pursuant to such transfer  shall be held as a separate  investment
fund.  Affected  Employees  shall be  permitted  to direct the transfer of their
accounts  under  Buyer's  Savings Plan out of, but not into,  such Parent Common
Stock fund.  Prior to or upon the  elimination of such Parent Common Stock fund,
Buyer shall,  subject to the fiduciary and other  requirements of ERISA, and any
other  applicable  law or  regulation,  take  such  actions

                                       57
<PAGE>

as are  reasonably  necessary to ensure the orderly and periodic  liquidation of
the shares of Parent Common Stock held in such fund.

                  (k)  NONQUALIFIED  PLANS.  (i) As of the day after the Closing
Date,  Affected Employees shall be eligible to participate in Buyer's Stock Unit
Retirement  Plan and Deferred  Compensation  Plan in accordance with their terms
and consistently with employees of Buyer in comparable employment positions.

                  (ii)  After the  Closing  Date,  but not later  than March 15,
2002, Parent shall, on behalf of the Companies,  credit an employer contribution
under Parent's Deferred  Compensation Plan for the 2001 plan year to the account
of each Affected  Employee who participated in such plan for the 2001 plan year,
without  regard to whether the Closing occurs on, prior to or after December 31,
2001.  Such  employer  contribution  shall be  credited  at the  rate  generally
applicable  to other  participants  who are eligible for employer  contributions
under Parent's Deferred  Compensation Plan, and shall take into account elective
deferral contributions of Affected Employees for 2001 prior to the Closing Date.
On or prior to the Closing  Date,  Parent  shall take all actions  necessary  to
ensure that Affected  Employees'  accounts under Parent's Deferred  Compensation
Plan are fully vested as of the Closing  Date.  The Closing  Date Balance  Sheet
shall not reflect  any amounts  accrued  for  amounts  credited  under  Parent's
Deferred Compensation Plan as provided herein.

                  (l) NO DUPLICATIVE BENEFITS.  Notwithstanding  anything herein
to the contrary,  nothing in this Agreement  shall be construed to require Buyer
or the  Companies  to provide  duplicative  benefits or accruals to any Affected
Employee  (or  anyone  else) or to employ or  continue  to employ  any  Affected
Employee or anyone  else,  and except to the extent  expressly  provided in this
SECTION 8.3, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as in any way limiting
or restricting Buyer's ability to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan at
any time and from time to time,  including any Company  Plan,  after the Closing
Date.

                  (m)  WITHDRAWAL  LIABILITY  ESTIMATES.  Parent shall  promptly
request from any Multiemployer Plan in which Affected Employees participate,  or
under which any Company could  reasonably  expect to have  withdrawal  liability
under Section 4201 of ERISA,  estimates as of the most recent date  available of
each of the Companies'  withdrawal liability and provide copies of any responses
to Buyer.

                  (n) EMPLOYEE  COMMUNICATIONS.  Subject to SECTION  7.1,  Buyer
shall be  permitted,  after the date of this  Agreement  and with the consent of
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to communicate in writing with
and solicit elections from Affected  Employees with respect to matters described
in this  SECTION  8.3 and in order to enable  Buyer to  accomplish  the  various
administrative  processes  required under this SECTION 8.3,  including  employee
education,  enrollment  and elections  under the various  benefit plans in which
Affected Employees will participate on and after the Closing Date.

                  SECTION 8.4  INSURANCE;  RISK OF LOSS.  (a) Parent shall cause
the Companies to keep insurance policies  currently  maintained by the Companies
covering their respective businesses, assets and current or former employees, as
the case may be, or  suitable  replacements


                                       58
<PAGE>

therefor,  in full force and effect through the close of business on the Closing
Date.  To the extent  that  after the  Closing  any party  hereto  requires  any
information  regarding claim data, payroll or other information in order to make
filing with insurance  carriers or self insurance  regulators from another party
hereto, the other party will promptly supply such information.

                  (b) Anything to the contrary  notwithstanding,  from and after
the Closing Date,  Parent  shall,  and shall cause the Sellers to, remain solely
responsible for any and all collateral,  bonding and guarantees,  relating to or
arising in connection with any and all workers' compensation, general liability,
automobile  liability and employee  medical  claims or policies of the Companies
relating  to  occurrences  on or prior to the Closing  Date.  From and after the
Closing  Date,  Buyer  shall be  responsible  to  continue  at its  expense  the
administration  of any  claim or loss  covered,  or which  is the  subject  of a
representation letter or being defended under a reservation of rights, under any
worker's compensation or liability policy maintained by Parent or its Affiliates
on or prior to the Closing Date.

                  (c) Parent shall each use its  reasonable  best efforts to (i)
acquire  for a period of five years after the Closing  Date  extended  reporting
period coverage with respect to the liability policies set forth in SCHEDULE 8.4
to cover claims made after the Closing  Date which are based on acts,  errors or
omissions which occur prior to the Closing Date (the "TAIL  POLICIES") and cause
Buyer to be named as an  additional  insured with respect to the Tail  Policies,
and (ii)  cause  Buyer to be named as an  additional  insured  for the five year
period prior to the Closing Date with respect to each occurrence-based liability
policy  maintained by Parent or its Affiliates  with respect to the Companies as
of the Closing Date. Parent and Buyer shall each pay one-half of the cost of the
Tail Policies and of Buyer's being so named as an additional insured.

                  SECTION 8.5 COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. (a) In furtherance of the
sale of the Shares, the HEA Membership  Interests and the SMMSLP LP Interests to
Buyer  hereunder,  Parent  covenants and agrees that, for a period ending on the
fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
(which term for  purposes  of this  SECTION 8.5 shall not include any Person who
may acquire  control of Parent after the Closing Date and any Affiliates of such
Person  immediately  prior  to  such  acquisition)  will  engage,   directly  or
indirectly,  anywhere  in the  world  where the  Business  is  conducted  by the
Companies as of the Closing  Date in business  activities  that are  competitive
with the  Business  as  conducted  by the  Companies  on the  Closing  Date (the
interest or business that includes such  conflicting  competitive  activities is
hereinafter referred to as a "COMPETITIVE  BUSINESS");  provided,  HOWEVER, that
nothing set forth in this SECTION 8.5 shall  prohibit  Parent or its  Affiliates
from (i)  engaging  in the  businesses  conducted  by Parent  or its  Affiliates
(excluding  the  Companies)  on the Closing Date and  described in SCHEDULE 8.5,
(ii) owning not in excess of 5% in the  aggregate of any class of capital  stock
or other equity interest of any corporation if such stock is publicly traded and
listed on any national or regional stock exchange or on the Nasdaq Stock Market,
(iii) owning an interest  acquired as a creditor in bankruptcy or otherwise than
by a voluntary investment  decision,  subject to compliance with SECTION 8.5(B),
or (iv)  acquiring the assets or capital stock or other equity  interests of any
other Person engaged in such business subject to compliance with SECTION 8.5(B);
and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that nothing set forth in this SECTION 8.5 shall prohibit
American Home Shield's investment portfolio managed by an independent investment
advisor

                                       59

from  including  not in  excess  of 5% in the  aggregate  of any class or equity
interest of any Person engaged in such Competitive Business.

                  (b) (i) Within 90 days of an  acquisition as  contemplated  by
SECTION  8.5(A)(IV)  in which the  annual  revenues  for the then most  recently
completed  fiscal year of the Competitive  Business  exceed $50 million,  Parent
shall offer to sell the Competitive  Business on a debt-free basis to Buyer at a
price (the "FIRST  OFFER  PRICE")  equal to the  product of (x) the  trailing 12
months EBITA of the  Competitive  Business  TIMES (y) the EBITA multiple used by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in valuing the Competitive  Business at the time
of acquisition  of such business (the  "COMPETITIVE  BUSINESS EBITA  MULTIPLE").
Parent shall provide to Buyer copies of the relevant portions of the acquisition
agreement  and  the  relevant  supporting  documents,  if any,  relating  to its
acquisition that includes the Competitive  Business.  Any such information shall
be kept  confidential  by Buyer and shall not be used for any purpose other than
its evaluation of Parent's offer. Within 30 days after receiving Parent's offer,
Buyer shall notify Parent  whether Buyer (or one of its  Affiliates)  intends to
purchase the Competitive  Business (a "COMPETITIVE  PURCHASE NOTICE").  If Buyer
notifies  Parent  that it (or  one of its  Affiliates)  will  not  purchase  the
Competitive  Business,  or if the  parties in good faith  fail to  complete  the
purchase within 90 days after the date of a Competitive  Purchase  Notice,  then
Parent shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts for the  following 12 months
(the "DIVESTITURE PERIOD") to divest itself of the Competitive  Business.  Under
no circumstances  shall Parent be required to consummate any transaction for the
sale of the  Competitive  Business  at a price less than the  product of (x) the
Competitive  Business  EBITA  Multiple TIMES (y) the trailing 12 months EBITA of
the  Competitive  Business at the time of such sale. If following the conclusion
of the Divestiture Period, Parent has not sold, or entered into an agreement for
the  sale  of,  the  Competitive  Business,  Parent  shall  offer  to  sell  the
Competitive  Business to Buyer at a price no greater than six times the trailing
12 months  EBITA of the  Competitive  Business  at the time of such sale.  Buyer
shall have 30 days from receipt of Parent's  offer to notify  Parent  whether it
intends to purchase the Competitive  Business and 90 days thereafter to complete
the  purchase of the  business  (or such longer  period as may be  necessary  to
comply with any applicable regulatory requirements).

                  (ii) Within 90 days of an acquisition as  contemplated  by (x)
SECTION  8.5(A)(III) or (y) SECTION  8.5(A)(IV) in which the annual revenues for
the then most recently completed fiscal year of the Competitive  Business exceed
$5  million  but are no more than $50  million,  in each case that is subject to
compliance with this SECTION 8.5(B),  Parent shall offer to sell the Competitive
Business  on a  debt-free  basis to Buyer at a price  equal to the  First  Offer
Price. The time periods and procedures  specified in SECTION 8.5(B)(I) for Buyer
to  respond  to  Parent's  offer to sell,  and to  consummate  the sale of,  the
Competitive Business and to obtain and keep confidential information relating to
the business shall also apply to a sale pursuant to this SECTION 8.5(B)(II).


                  (iii) If Parent or any of its  Affiliates  acquires the assets
or  capital  stock  or  other  equity  interests  of  any  Person  engaged  in a
Competitive  Business that does not trigger the sale  requirements  specified in
subsections (i) or (ii) of this SECTION 8.5(B),  Parent shall have no obligation
to comply with the provisions of this SECTION 8.5(B) until such time, if any, as
the cumulative effect of any acquisitions of a Competitive  Business would cause
Parent or any of its  Affiliates to then hold in the aggregate  assets,  capital
stock or other

                                       60
<PAGE>


equity interests of a Competitive  Business in excess of the monetary thresholds
set forth in  subsections  (i) or (ii)  above.  In such event,  Parent  shall be
required to dispose of the aggregate  assets of such  Competitive  Businesses in
accordance  with the  terms and  provisions  of  subsection  (i) or (ii) of this
SECTION 8.5(B), whichever is applicable,  PROVIDED that the Competitive Business
EBITA  Multiple for such purpose  shall be equal to the EBITA  multiple  used by
Parent  or  any  of  its  affiliates  in  valuing  the  most  recently  acquired
Competitive Business.

                  (c) If the  provisions  of this  SECTION  8.5  should  ever be
deemed to exceed the time or  geographic  limitations  or any other  limitations
permitted by applicable law in any  jurisdiction,  then such provisions shall be
deemed reformed in such jurisdiction to the maximum permitted by applicable law.
If Parent or any Affiliate of Parent violates any of its obligations  under this
SECTION 8.5, Buyer and its  Affiliates  may proceed  against Parent in law or in
equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate.  Parent
acknowledges  that a  violation  of this  SECTION  8.5 will cause  Buyer and its
Affiliates  irreparable harm which cannot be adequately compensated for by money
damages.  Parent  therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened
violation of this SECTION 8.5,  Buyer and its Affiliates  shall be entitled,  in
addition to other remedies that they may have, to a temporary  restraining order
and to preliminary and final injunctive  relief against Parent or such Affiliate
of Parent to prevent any  violations of this SECTION 8.5,  without the necessity
of  proving  actual  damages  or  posting a bond.  Parent  further  specifically
acknowledges  and  agrees  that the  Buyer  or an  Affiliate  of Buyer  shall be
entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings,  profits and other benefits
arising from any such breach.

                  SECTION  8.6  RIGHT  TO  CONTROL  LITIGATION;   PRODUCTION  OF
WITNESSES.  Buyer  hereby  acknowledges  and agrees that Parent shall retain the
sole and  absolute  right to  control,  defend  against,  negotiate,  settle  or
otherwise  deal  with any  proceeding,  claim or  demand  which  relates  to the
Excluded Litigation,  and at all times from and after the Closing Date until the
Excluded Litigation has been completed,  Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to Parent,  without cost (other than  reimbursement of
actual  out-of-pocket  expenses) to, and upon prior written  request of, Parent,
the directors,  officers, employees and agents of the Companies, including those
persons  listed  in  SCHEDULE  8.6,  as  witnesses  to the  extent  the same may
reasonably  be required by Parent in  connection  with the Excluded  Litigation;
PROVIDED,  that Buyer's  making such  personnel  available  is not  unreasonably
disruptive to the Business of the Companies.

                  SECTION 8.7 NO SHOP.  Until the earlier of the Closing Date or
termination  of this  Agreement  pursuant to ARTICLE XII,  Parent shall not, and
shall cause the  Companies and each of Parent's  subsidiaries  not to, and shall
cause   their   respective   employees,    officers,   directors,    affiliates,
representatives and agents (including investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other financial advisors or consultants) not to, (a) make, solicit,  assist,
initiate, or in any way facilitate or encourage any inquiries, proposals, offers
or bids from any Person or group  (other than  Buyer)  (each,  a "THIRD  PARTY")
relating to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, purchase or
similar  transaction  involving  the  acquisition  of any assets,  properties or
rights of any Company (other than for sales of inventory in the ordinary  course
consistent  with past  practice or as otherwise  permitted by SECTION 7.4) or of
any capital stock or any other equity


                                       61
<PAGE>


interest  of any  Company  (an  "ACQUISITION  TRANSACTION"),  (b) enter into any
understanding,  arrangement,  agreement or agreement in principle with any Third
Party relating to any proposed or contemplated Acquisition  Transaction,  (c)(i)
furnish any information  with respect to the business,  activities,  operations,
assets,  properties or liabilities of any Company or any of its  subsidiaries to
any Third  Party or (ii)  cooperate  with any Third  Party  with  respect to any
proposed or contemplated Acquisition Transaction or (d) proceed or continue with
any  discussions or negotiations in respect of any of the foregoing which may be
in  progress  as of the  date  of this  Agreement.  Parent  agrees  that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussion
or  negotiations  with any  parties  conducted  heretofore  with  respect to any
potential  Acquisition  Transaction,  and shall notify  Buyer by facsimile  (and
confirm  receipt by telephone)  within one business day following  receipt by or
awareness of any executive officer of Parent of any inquiry,  proposal, offer or
bid in respect of any  Acquisition  Transaction.  Prior to the  Closing,  Parent
shall  request the  destruction  or return of all  non-public,  confidential  or
proprietary  information concerning the Companies provided to any Third Party in
connection  with any  potential  Acquisition  Transaction.  On the Closing Date,
Parent shall assign to Buyer all  confidentiality  agreements  entered into with
any Third Party in connection with any potential  Acquisition  Transaction since
January 1, 2001.

                  SECTION 8.8  NONSOLICITATION.  Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
8.8, Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its  subsidiaries  and Affiliates
not to,  for a period  commencing  on the date  hereof  and ending on the second
anniversary of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the  termination of this  Agreement,
as the case may be,  without the prior  written  approval of Buyer,  directly or
indirectly  solicit,  encourage,  entice or induce for  employment  (except that
Parent and its Affiliates may make  generalized  searches for employees  through
general  advertisements)  or hire as an employee or consultant any person who is
on the date hereof or at any time prior to the  Closing  Date an employee of any
Company;  PROVIDED,  that Parent and its  affiliates  shall not be  precluded or
restricted from hiring any person whose  employment with a Company is terminated
by a Company.  If it is ever held that the restriction  placed on Parent by this
SECTION 8.8 is too onerous and is not  necessary  for the  protection  of Buyer,
Parent  agrees  that any  court of  competent  jurisdiction  may  impose  lesser
restrictions  which such court may consider necessary or appropriate to properly
protect Buyer.

                  SECTION  8.9  AUDITED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.   Prior  to  the
Closing,  Parent shall, and shall cause the Companies to,  reasonably  cooperate
with and  provide  to Buyer and its  representatives  access  to the  accounting
records and such other  financial and business  information  of the Companies as
may be required under applicable state and federal securities laws in connection
with the  preparation of the prospectus  relating to a public offering of equity
or debt securities by Buyer or one of its  subsidiaries  and to the officers and
employees of the Companies  for purposes of  responding to questions  concerning
the  Business and such  financial  and other  information.  Such access shall be
afforded by Parent upon  reasonable  advance  notice and during normal  business
hours and at Buyer's sole  expense.  Parent shall also request  Arthur  Andersen
LLP, at Buyer's expense, to audit the financial  statements of the Companies for
the year ended  December 31, 2000 and, if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or prior  to  December  31,  2001,  to audit  the  financial  statements  of the
Companies for the year ended

                                       62
<PAGE>


December 31, 2001 and, in each case, to provide to Buyer and its representatives
access to the work papers used in connection with such audits.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

                  SECTION 11.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY PARENT. (a) From and after the
Closing,  Parent  agrees to indemnify  and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member

claims with respect to SECTION 11.1(A)(VIII)); and

                  (y) the  aggregate  amount of such Losses and Expenses  (other

FURTHER, that Parent shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless any
Buyer Group Member for any Losses in respect of any breach of any representation
or warranty for which Buyer was fully compensated pursuant to the adjustment to
the Purchase Price on account of a decrease in Net Working Capital from Target
Net Working Capital.

                  (b) The  indemnification  provided for in SECTIONS  11.1(A)(I)
and 11.1(A)(II)  shall terminate  eighteen months after the Closing Date (and no
claims  shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under  SECTIONS  11.1(A)(I)  and
11.1(A)(II)  thereafter),  except  that  the  indemnification  by  Parent  shall
continue as to:

                  (i) the  representations  of Parent set forth in SECTION 5.17,
which shall survive for a period of three years after the Closing Date;

                  (ii) the  covenants of Parent set forth in SECTIONS  8.1, 8.5,
8.7,  8.8,  8.9 and 13.6,  which shall  survive for the period of time set forth
therein;

                  (iii)  the  representations  of Parent  set forth in  SECTIONS
5.2(B), 5.4(A), 5.4(B), 5.7, 5.12 and 5.24 and the covenants of Parent set forth
in  SECTIONS  8.2,  8.3,  8.4,  13.2 and 13.13  which  shall  survive  until the
expiration of the relevant  statutory  period of  limitations  applicable to the
underlying claim, giving effect to any waiver,  mitigation or extension thereof;
and

                  (iv) any Losses or Expenses  of which any Buyer  Group  Member
has validly given a Claim Notice to Parent in accordance  with the  requirements
of SECTION  11.3 on or prior to the date such  indemnification  would  otherwise
terminate in accordance  with this SECTION  11.1, as to which the  obligation of
Parent shall continue solely with respect to the specific  matters in such Claim
Notice until the liability of Parent shall have been determined pursuant to this
ARTICLE XI, and Parent  shall have  reimbursed  all Buyer Group  Members for the
full amount of such Losses and  Expenses  that are payable  with respect to such
Claim Notice in accordance with this ARTICLE XI.

                  (c) Notwithstanding Buyer's rights under SECTION 11.1(A), this
SECTION  11.1(C) and SECTION  11.1(A)(IV)  shall be the sole indemnity by Parent
with respect to Environmental Claims (including  Environmental Claims that might
otherwise   constitute  a  breach  of  SECTION   5.17(VI)  but   excluding   any
Environmental Claims that are Excluded Liabilities).  Subject to the limitations
set forth below, from and after the Closing Date, Parent agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against its proportional share of
any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by or asserted against such Buyer Group
Member in respect of any  Environmental  Claim as follows:  for a period of five
years  after the Closing  Date,  Parent  shall bear 75% and Buyer Group  Members
shall bear 25% of all Losses and  Expenses  incurred  as a result of any and all
Environmental Claims.

                  Parent's  obligation  to  provide  indemnification  under this
SECTION 11.1(C) shall terminate on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and
Buyer Group Members shall have no further responsibility for Losses and Expenses
arising  out  of  Environmental  Claims;  PROVIDED  THAT  indemnification  shall
continue with respect to Losses and Expenses for Environmental  Claims for which
any Buyer Group Member validly provided notice pursuant to SECTION 11.3 prior to
the fifth  anniversary of the Closing Date, as to which the obligation of Parent
shall  continue  solely with  respect to each  specific  Environmental  Claim so
noticed  until the  liability of Parent shall have been  determined  pursuant to
this ARTICLE XI, and Parent shall have  reimbursed


                                       67
<PAGE>


the Buyer Group  Members for its  proportional  share of the Losses and Expenses
payable with respect to such Environmental Claim in accordance with this ARTICLE
XI.

                  Buyer  Group  Members  shall  have the  right to  control  any
Environmental  Claim  involving  Remedial  Action at any Owned Real  Property or
Leased  Real  Property;   PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that  counsel,   consultants  and
contractors  must be reasonably  acceptable to Parent which acceptance shall not
be unreasonably withheld, qualified or delayed. In addition, Buyer Group Members
shall work  cooperatively  with  Parent to ensure  that any  Remedial  Action is
reasonable under the circumstances and shall keep Parent reasonably  apprised of
the status and progress of the Remedial  Action and provide  Parent a reasonable
opportunity  for input to and  comment  on any  remedial  plan,  report or other
material  correspondence  with the relevant  Governmental  Body,  as well as the
right to participate in discussions  with such  Governmental  Body regarding the
scope of required Remedial Action. The right to control all other  Environmental
Claims shall be as provided in SECTION 11.5.

                  SECTION  11.2  INDEMNIFICATION  BY BUYER.  (a) Buyer agrees to
indemnify  and hold  harmless  each Parent Group Member from and against any and
all Losses and Expenses  incurred by such Parent Group Member in connection with
or arising from:

                  (i)  any  breach  of any  warranty  or the  inaccuracy  of any

case without regard to any exception for Material Adverse Effect, materiality or
the like contained therein;

                  (ii) any breach by Buyer of, or  failure by Buyer to  perform,
any of its covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement;

                  (iii) the conduct of the  Business and the  operations  of the
Companies  following  the Closing  Date (except for such matters for which Buyer
Group Members are entitled to  indemnification  under  SECTION  11.1,  including
indemnification  in respect of the covenants  contained in SECTIONS 8.2, 8.3 and
8.4);

                  (iv) subject to SECTION 8.4, any Guarantees of or by Parent or
any Affiliate of Parent (other than the  Companies) of obligations of any of the
Companies  referred to in SECTION 7.6 which Guarantees remain  outstanding after
the Closing Date;

Real  Property  Liabilities  to the  extent  assumed by the  Downers  Grove Real
Property  Buyer  pursuant  to the  Downers  Grove Real  Property  Instrument  of
Assignment and  Assumption,  except to the extent that any Losses or Expenses in
respect  thereof  relate  to or arise  out of any  breach  of a  representation,
warranty or covenant  contained  in ARTICLES VI and VII or relate to a matter as
to which Buyer is indemnified pursuant to SECTION 11.1(A) or (C); and

                  (vi)  any  costs  of  maintaining   collateral,   bonding  and
guarantees  relating to workers'  compensation,  general  liability,  automobile

                                       68
<PAGE>


claims or policies  relating  to  occurrences  on or prior to the  Closing  Date
attributable  to the  Companies  and any  amounts  required to be paid by Parent
under such collateral,  bonding or guarantees  resulting from a default by Buyer
in its obligations to pay such claims or pursuant to such policies;

                  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that Buyer shall be required to indemnify
and hold harmless under SECTION  11.2(A)(I)  with respect to Losses and Expenses
incurred by Parent Group Members only to the extent that:

                  (x) the amount of Loss and Expense  suffered  by Parent  Group
Members  related to each individual  claim exceeds $25,000 (it being  understood
that  such  $25,000  shall  be a  deductible  for  which  Buyer  shall  bear  no
indemnification responsibility); and

                  (y) the  aggregate  amount of such Losses and Expenses  (other
than Losses and Expenses  excluded by clause (x) above)  exceeds  $4,000,000 (it
being  understood  that such  $4,000,000  shall be a deductible  for which Buyer
shall bear no indemnification responsibility);

PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the limitations contained in the preceding proviso shall
not apply to any Loss or Expense incurred by any Parent Group Member in
connection with or arising from any breach of any representation or warranty in
SECTION 6.2(A) or 6.6; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the aggregate amount required
to be paid by Buyer pursuant to this SECTION 11.2(A)(I) (other than in respect
of a breach of any representation in SECTION 6.2(A) or 6.6 and other than in
respect of any knowing or fraudulent breach of a representation or warranty)
shall not exceed $120,000,000.

(b) The indemnification provided for in SECTIONS 11.2(A)(I) and 11.2(A)(II)
shall terminate eighteen months after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be
made by any Parent Group Member under SECTIONS 11.2(A)(I) and 11.2(A)(II)
thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to:

                  (i) the  covenants of Buyer set forth in SECTIONS 8.1, 8.6 and
13.6, which shall survive for the period of time set forth
therein;

                  (ii) the representations of Buyer set forth in SECTIONS 6.2(A)

of limitations  applicable to the underlying claim, giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof; and

                  (iii) any Losses or Expenses of which any Parent  Group Member
has validly given a Claim Notice to Buyer in accordance with the requirements of

Notice until the liability of Buyer shall have been determined  pursuant to this

                  SECTION  11.3  NOTICE OF  CLAIMS.  Any Buyer  Group  Member or
Parent Group Member seeking indemnification  hereunder (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY")
shall give promptly to the party  obligated to provide  indemnification  to such
Indemnified Party (the  "INDEMNITOR") a notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE")  describing in
reasonable  detail  the  facts  giving  rise to the  claim  for  indemnification
hereunder  and shall  include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or
the method of  computation  of the amount of such claim,  and a reference to the
provision  of this  Agreement  or any other  agreement,  document or  instrument
executed  hereunder or in  connection  herewith  upon which such claim is based;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit
in equity  by or  against a third  Person  as to which  indemnification  will be
sought  shall be given  promptly  after  the  action or suit is  commenced.  The
failure to give notice as provided  in this  SECTION  11.3 shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations  hereunder except to the extent it shall have been
materially prejudiced by such failure.

                  SECTION 11.4  DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT.  (a) In calculating any
Loss or Expense  there  shall be  deducted  any  insurance  recovery  in respect
thereof.  Buyer and Parent agree that,  for purposes of computing  the amount of
any indemnification  payment under this ARTICLE XI, the indemnification  payment
otherwise  payable shall be increased by an amount  sufficient to compensate the
indemnified  party for actual net increases in Taxes payable by the  indemnified
party as a result of the  indemnification  payment  being  included  in  taxable
income; PROVIDED, Buyer and Parent agree to treat (and to cause each Buyer Group
Member or Parent  Group  Member,  respectively,  to treat) each  indemnification
payment  (including  any  payment  made  pursuant  to this  SECTION  11.4) as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes  (unless,  with respect to
the recipient of the indemnification  payment,  such reporting position is later
disallowed in a final  determination in any administrative or court proceeding).
If  Parent is  required  to  indemnify  a Buyer  Group  Member  pursuant  to the
provisions  of SECTION  11.1,  and the cost,  expense or liability for which the
indemnification  is sought  under  SECTION  11.1 could  provide  any Buyer Group
Member  with a Tax  benefit,  Buyer  shall pay Parent  the  actual  Tax  benefit
realized by such Buyer Group  Member.  The Tax benefit  shall be  determined  by
Buyer (with such  determination  to be  evidenced  by an  officer's  certificate
delivered  by Buyer to Parent not later than  thirty (30) days after the day the
Tax Benefit is realized by any Buyer Group Member) and, at the request of Parent
(and at Parent's  expense),  shall be verified by Buyer's  accounting firm. Such
determination (and any such  verification)  shall be based on the position taken
by Buyer Group Members and their Affiliates on their Tax Returns.  The amount of
any Tax benefit  shall be paid by Buyer to Parent not later than sixty (60) days
after the day such Tax benefit is actually  realized by any Buyer Group  Member;
PROVIDED, that in connection with the initial computation of the indemnification
payment relating to a cost, expense or liability that could provide Tax benefits
to any Buyer  Group  Member,  Buyer and Parent  shall  endeavor in good faith to
arrive at a  reasonably  acceptable  estimate of the  present  value of all such
actual Tax Benefits  provided or to be provided to all Buyer Group  Members,  in
which case Buyer shall pay to Parent such estimated amount at such time (whether
or not in advance of the benefits actually being realized).

                  (b) After the giving of any Claim  Notice  pursuant to SECTION
11.3,  the amount of  indemnification  to which an  Indemnified  Party  shall be
entitled under this ARTICLE XI shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement
between the Indemnified  Party and the  Indemnitor;  (ii)

                                       70
<PAGE>


by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent  jurisdiction;  or (iii)
by any other  means to which the  Indemnified  Party  and the  Indemnitor  shall
agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for
appeal,  if any,  shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when
all appeals  taken shall have been finally  determined.  The  Indemnified  Party
shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses
suffered by it.

                  SECTION  11.5  THIRD  PERSON  CLAIMS.  (a) Any  party  seeking
indemnification  provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of
or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person against the  Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnitor in writing,  and in reasonable  detail, of the
third  Person claim within 10 days after  receipt by such  Indemnified  Party of
written notice of the third Person claim.  The  Indemnitor  shall be entitled to
participate  jointly  with  the  Indemnified  Party in the  Indemnified  Party's
defense,  settlement or other disposition of any such claim. With respect to any
such claim  relating  solely to the payment of money  damages and which will not
result in the Indemnified Party's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief
or  otherwise  adversely  affect the  business of the  Indemnified  Party in any
manner,  and as to which the Indemnitor  shall have  acknowledged in writing the
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified  Party  hereunder,  the Indemnitor shall
have the sole right to defend,  settle or  otherwise  dispose of such claim,  on
such terms as the Indemnitor,  in its sole discretion,  shall deem  appropriate;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the Indemnitor shall obtain the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, prior to ceasing to
defend, settling or otherwise disposing of any such claim if as a result thereof
the  Indemnified  Party would become  subject to injunctive  or other  equitable
relief or the business,  properties or assets of the Indemnified  Party would be
adversely affected in any manner; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the Indemnified
Party has elected to be represented by separate  counsel pursuant to the proviso
to the following sentence,  such settlement or compromise shall be effected only
with the written  consent of the Indemnified  Party,  which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. After notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party
of its  election to assume the defense of such claim or action,  the  Indemnitor
shall not be liable to the  Indemnified  Party under this  SECTION  11.5 for any
Expenses  subsequently  incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the  Indemnified  Party shall have the right to employ counsel to represent
it if, in the Indemnified Party's reasonable  judgment,  it is advisable for the
Indemnified Party to be represented by separate  counsel,  and in that event the
fees and  expenses of such  separate  counsel  shall be paid by the  Indemnified
Party.  The parties each agree to render to the other parties such assistance as
may  reasonably be requested in order to insure the proper and adequate  defense
of any such claim or proceeding.

                  (b) To the extent of any  inconsistency  between  this SECTION
11.5 and SECTION 8.2(C)  (relating to Tax  contests),  the provisions of SECTION
8.2(C) shall control with respect to Tax contests.

                  SECTION 11.6 LIMITATIONS. (a) In any case where an Indemnified
Party recovers from third Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect
to which an  Indemnitor  has  indemnified  it pursuant to this  ARTICLE XI, such
Indemnified  Party  shall  promptly  pay over to the  Indemnitor  the  amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses


                                       71
<PAGE>

incurred by it in procuring such recovery and any applicable  Taxes), but not in
excess of the sum of (i) any amount  previously so paid by the  Indemnitor to or
on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount
expended by the  Indemnitor  in pursuing or defending  any claim  arising out of
such matter.

                  (b) Except for  remedies  that cannot be waived as a matter of
law (including fraud) and injunctive and provisional relief (including  specific
performance),  if the Closing  occurs,  this  ARTICLE XI shall be the  exclusive
remedy for  breaches of this  Agreement  (including  any  covenant,  obligation,
representation  or warranty  contained in this  Agreement or in any  certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of the sale of the
Shares,  the HEA  Membership  Interests  and the  SMMSLP  LP  Interests  and the
assignment  and  assumption  of  the  Assumed  Agreements  contemplated  hereby;
PROVIDED,  that Parent's  indemnity  under this ARTICLE XI shall be Buyer's sole
and  exclusive  remedy with  respect to  Environmental  Matters  arising from or
related to the operations of any Company, regardless of when occurring.

                  SECTION 11.7  MITIGATION.  Each of the parties  agrees to take
all reasonable steps to mitigate their  respective  Losses and Expenses upon and
after  becoming  aware of any  event or  condition  which  could  reasonably  be
expected  to  give  rise to any  Losses  and  Expenses  that  are  indemnifiable
hereunder.

Buyer's  Closing  obligations  shall become  incapable of being satisfied by the
date set forth in SECTION 12.1(E) and is not waived; PROVIDED, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 12.1(B) shall not be available

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 12.1(C) shall not be available
to Parent if Parent has not used its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause
such condition to be satisfied;

                  (d) by Buyer or Parent if any court of competent  jurisdiction
in the United States or other United States  Governmental Body shall have issued
a final and  non-appealable  order,  decree or ruling  permanently  restraining,
enjoining  or  otherwise   prohibiting  the  consummation  of  the  transactions
contemplated hereby; or


                                       72
<PAGE>


(e) by Buyer or Parent if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before April
30, 2002 or, if the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice shall issue a request requiring the submission of
additional information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act which has
not been satisfied on or before December 31, 2001, June 30, 2002 (or such later
date as may be agreed in writing to by Buyer and Parent).

                  SECTION  12.2  NOTICE OF  TERMINATION.  Any party  desiring to
terminate this  Agreement  pursuant to SECTION 12.1 shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party to this Agreement.

                  SECTION 12.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement shall be
terminated  pursuant to this ARTICLE XII, all further obligations of the parties
under this Agreement (other than SECTIONS 13.2 and 13.10 and the Confidentiality

other;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that nothing  herein  shall  relieve any party from
liability for its willful breach of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

                  SECTION 13.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES.  All
representations  and warranties  contained in this  Agreement  shall survive the
consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement  through the
period   during  which  claims  for   indemnification   may  be  made  for  such
representations  and warranties  pursuant to ARTICLE XI or SECTION 8.2 (at which
time such representations and warranties shall terminate).

                  SECTION 13.2  CONFIDENTIAL  NATURE OF  INFORMATION.  (a) Buyer
agrees  that it will treat in  confidence  all  documents,  materials  and other
information which it shall have obtained  regarding Parent or any Company during
the course of the  negotiations  leading to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  hereby  (whether  obtained  before  or  after  the  date  of  this
Agreement),  the  investigation  provided for herein and the preparation of this
Agreement  and  other  related  documents  in  accordance  with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

                  (b)  Parent  acknowledges  that  certain  of  the  information
relating  to  the  Business  and  the  Companies  and  their   subsidiaries   is
confidential and that such information is a special, valuable and major asset of
the Business and the Companies,  and that wrongful use or disclosure of any such
confidential  information  would cause the Business and the Companies  immediate
and irreparable harm. Without the prior written consent of Buyer,  Parent agrees
that it will not, and will cause its  Affiliates not to, and will not permit its
agents,  representatives,  employees,  officers and  directors  to,  disclose to
others or use for Parent's own benefit or purposes or the benefit or purposes of
any other Person  other than Buyer or its  Affiliates,  directly or  indirectly,
from and after the Closing Date, any information  relating to the Business,  any
Company  or  any  of  their  respective  employees,   representatives,   agents,
stockholders,  officers, directors, partners or their respective family members,
including trade secrets,  and business "know-how,"  information,  data, or other
confidential information relating to the Business



                                       73
<PAGE>

conducted prior to the Closing Date, to customers, costs, marketing, investment,
sales activities, promotion, credit and financial data, manufacturing processes,
financing  methods,  plans or the  business  and affairs of the  Business or any
Company generally, as well as all analyses, compilations, data bases, studies or
other  documents  prepared  by  Parent  or any of its  agents,  representatives,
Affiliates,  employees, officers or directors containing or based in whole or in
part on such information, except as may be necessary to avoid a violation of law
and except as permitted under any Seller Ancillary  Agreement or Buyer Ancillary
Agreement.  If  Parent  or  any  of  its  agents,  representatives,  Affiliates,
employees,  officers or directors becomes legally compelled to disclose any such
information,  Parent  agrees that it will, to the extent  practicable,  and will
cause its Affiliates to, and shall use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
cause such agent,  representative,  employee,  officer or director  to,  provide
Buyer  with  prompt  written  notice of such  requirement  so that  Buyer or the
relevant Company may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance
with  this  SECTION  13.2.  If such  protective  order  or other  remedy  is not
obtained,  or Buyer waives compliance with this SECTION 13.2, Parent agrees that
it will, to the extent  practicable,  cause its Affiliates not to, and shall use
its  reasonable  best efforts to cause its agents,  representatives,  employees,
officers  or  directors  to,  furnish  only such  portion  of such  confidential
information  which is legally  required to be provided and  exercise  reasonable
best efforts to obtain assurances that  confidential  treatment will be accorded
such information.

                  (c)  The  obligation  of  Parent  to  treat  such  information
relating to the Business and the Companies in confidence  shall not apply to any
information  which  Parent  demonstrates  (i) is on the date hereof or hereafter
becomes  generally  available  to  the  public  other  than  as  a  result  of a
disclosure,  directly or indirectly, by Parent or its representatives,  (ii) was
available to Parent or its  representatives on a nonconfidential  basis prior to

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors  and  permitted  assigns;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no party to this

under this  Agreement  without the express  prior  written  consent of the other

assigned  prior to the  Closing,  without the consent of Parent,  to one or more
corporations  all  of the  outstanding  capital  stock  of  which  is  owned  or
controlled by Buyer or to one or more general or limited partnerships or limited
liability companies owned or controlled by Buyer or, with

rights  hereunder,  but no such  assignment  shall relieve it of its obligations
hereunder.

                  SECTION 13.6 ACCESS TO RECORDS AFTER CLOSING. (a) For a period
of six years after the Closing Date, Parent and its  representatives  shall have
reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Companies to the extent
that such access may reasonably be required by Parent in connection with matters
relating to or affected by the operations of the Companies  prior to the Closing
Date. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable  advance
notice and during normal business hours.  Parent shall be solely responsible for
any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this SECTION 13.6(A).  If Buyer
or the Companies  shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior
to  the  expiration  of  such  six-year  period,  Buyer  shall,  prior  to  such
disposition,  give Parent a  reasonable  opportunity,  at Parent's  expense,  to
segregate and remove such books and records as Parent may select.

                  (b) For a period of six years  after the Closing  Date,  Buyer
and its  representatives  shall have  reasonable  access to all of the books and
records  relating to the  Companies  which Parent or any of its  Affiliates  may
retain after the Closing  Date.  Such access shall be afforded by Parent and its
Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable  advance notice and during normal business
hours.  Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by
it pursuant to this SECTION  13.6(B).  If Parent or any of its Affiliates  shall
desire to dispose of any of such books and records  prior to the  expiration  of
such six-year  period,  Parent shall,  prior to such  disposition,  give Buyer a
reasonable  opportunity,  at Buyer's expense, to segregate and remove such books
and records as Buyer may select.

                  SECTION  13.7  ENTIRE  AGREEMENT;  AMENDMENTS;  NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement,  the Exhibits and Schedules  referred to herein,
the  documents  delivered  pursuant  hereto  and the  Confidentiality  Agreement
contain  the entire  understanding  of the  parties  hereto  with  regard to the
subject  matter  contained  herein or  therein,  and  supersede  all other prior
representations,  warranties,  agreements,  understandings  or letters of intent
between or among any of the parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended,
modified or supplemented  except by a written instrument signed by an authorized
representative of each of the parties hereto. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or  implied,  is intended  to or shall  confer upon any other  person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature  whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement
other than the Buyer  Group  Members and the Parent  Group  Members who shall be
third party beneficiaries with respect to ARTICLE XI.

                  SECTION 13.8 INTERPRETATION. Disclosure of any fact or item in
any Schedule hereto  referenced by a particular  section in this Agreement shall
be deemed to have been  disclosed  with  respect  to any other  section  in this
Agreement as to which its relevance and applicability is readily apparent except
for  SCHEDULES  5.5, 5.6 and 5.19 with  respect to which


                                       76
<PAGE>

only matters expressly  disclosed thereon will be deemed disclosed.  Neither the
specification of any dollar amount in any  representation or warranty  contained
in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule  hereto
is intended to imply that such amount,  or higher or lower amounts,  or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material,  and no party shall use the
fact of the setting  forth of any such amount or the  inclusion of any such item
in any dispute or controversy  between the parties as to whether any obligation,
item or matter not  described  herein or included  in any  Schedule is or is not
material  for purposes of this  Agreement.  Unless this  Agreement  specifically
provides  otherwise,  neither  the  specification  of any item or  matter in any
representation or warranty  contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific  item in any  Schedule  hereto is  intended  to imply that such item or
matter,  or other items or  matters,  are or are not in the  ordinary  course of
business,  and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the inclusion
of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy  between the parties as
to whether any  obligation,  item or matter not described  herein or included in
any  Schedule is or is not in the  ordinary  course of business  for purposes of
this  Agreement.  The  respective  representations,  warranties,  covenants  and
agreements of Parent and the Buyer  contained  herein or in any Buyer  Ancillary
Agreement or Seller Ancillary  Agreement shall not be deemed waived or otherwise
affected by any  investigations  made by or on behalf of , or knowledge  of, any
party  hereto.  Parent  may,  from time to time prior to or at the  Closing,  by
notice in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement,  supplement,  amend or
create any Schedule,  in order to add information or correct previously supplied
information.  No such amendment  shall be evidence,  in and of itself,  that the
representations  and warranties in the corresponding  section are no longer true
and  correct in all  material  respects.  It is  specifically  agreed  that such
Schedules may be amended to add immaterial,  as well as material, items thereto.
No such supplemental, amended or additional Schedule shall be deemed to cure any
breach for purposes of SECTION 9.1 or ARTICLE XI.

                  SECTION 13.9 WAIVERS.  Any term or provision of this Agreement
may be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended,  by the party or
parties  entitled to the benefit  thereof.  Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently  authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by the Chairman,  the  President,  an executive vice
president or senior vice president of Parent or by an authorized  representative
of Buyer,  as the case may be. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any
time any  provision of this  Agreement  shall not be construed to be a waiver of
such  provision,  nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any
part hereof or the right of any party  thereafter to enforce each and every such
provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

                  SECTION 13.10 EXPENSES.  Except as expressly set forth herein,
each party  hereto will pay all costs and expenses  incident to its  negotiation
and preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all
agreements  and  conditions  contained  herein  on its part to be  performed  or
complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and
independent public accountants.

                  SECTION  13.11 PARTIAL  INVALIDITY.  Wherever  possible,  each
provision  hereof shall be  interpreted  in such manner as to be  effective  and
valid  under  applicable  law,  but in case  any  one or more of the  provisions
contained  herein  shall,  for any  reason,  be held to be  invalid,  illegal


                                       77
<PAGE>


or  unenforceable  in any respect,  such  provision  shall be ineffective to the
extent,   but  only  to  the  extent,   of  such   invalidity,   illegality   or
unenforceability  without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable  provision or provisions or any other  provisions  hereof,  unless
such a construction would be unreasonable.

                  SECTION 13.12 EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed  in  counterparts,  each of  which  shall  be  considered  an  original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become binding when one or more  counterparts  have been signed by each of
the parties hereto and delivered to Parent and Buyer.

                  SECTION  13.13  FURTHER   ASSURANCES.   Without  limiting  the
provisions of SECTION 7.3, upon the terms and subject to the conditions  herein,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable  best efforts to take or
cause to be taken  all  action,  to do or cause to be done,  and to  assist  and
cooperate  with the  other  party in  doing,  all  things  necessary,  proper or
advisable  under   applicable  laws  and  regulations  to  consummate  and  make
effective,  in  the  most  expeditious  manner  practicable,   the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent  to the  obligations  of  any of the  parties  hereto;  and  (ii)  the
execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions
as the other  party  hereto  may  reasonably  require  in order to carry out the
intent of this Agreement.

                  SECTION  13.14  DISCLAIMER  OF  WARRANTIES.  Parent  makes  no
representations  or  warranties  with respect to any  projections,  forecasts or
forward-looking  information  provided to Buyer.  There is no assurance that any
projected or  forecasted  results will be achieved.  EXCEPT AS TO THOSE  MATTERS
EXPRESSLY  COVERED BY THE  REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE  CERTIFICATE  TO BE DELIVERED  BY PARENT  PURSUANT TO SECTION 9.1 AND IN THE
SELLER  ANCILLARY  AGREEMENTS  AND THE  CERTIFICATE  TO BE  DELIVERED  BY  BUYER
PURSUANT TO SECTION 10.1 AND THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS,  EACH OF PARENT AND BUYER
DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,  REPRESENTATIONS  AND GUARANTEES WHETHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED.  NEITHER PARENT NOR BUYER MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY  OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES
WHATSOEVER.   Buyer   acknowledges   that   neither   Parent   nor  any  of  its
representatives or Affiliates or any other Person has made any representation or
warranty,  express  or  implied,  as to  the  accuracy  or  completeness  of any
memoranda,  charts  or  summaries  heretofore  made  available  by Parent or its
representatives  or  Affiliates to Buyer or any other  information  which is not
included in this Agreement or the Schedules  hereto,  and neither Parent nor any
of its representatives or Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject
to any liability to Buyer,  any Affiliate of Buyer or any other Person resulting
from the distribution of any such information to, or use of any such information
by,  Buyer,  any  Affiliate  of  Buyer  or any  of  their  agents,  consultants,
accountants, counsel or other representatives.

                  SECTION 13.15 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION.  This
Agreement  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York. By the execution  and delivery of this  Agreement,  Buyer and
Parent submit to the personal


                                       78

jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the State of New York in any suit
or  proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
