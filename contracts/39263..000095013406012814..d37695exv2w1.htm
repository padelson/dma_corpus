take, in accordance with applicable law and its Constituent Documents, all action necessary
to convene a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement, the

However, if the Company Board, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) counsel,
determines in good faith that, because of the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this

Meeting, the Company Board may submit such items without recommendation (although the
resolutions adopting such items prior to the date hereof, described in Section&nbsp;6.2(a), may
not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may communicate the basis for
its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; <I>provided </I>that the Company
Board may not take any actions under this sentence until after giving Parent at least 10
business days to respond to such Acquisition Proposal (and after giving Parent notice of the
third party in the Acquisition Proposal and the latest material terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal) and then taking into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by Company.

materially impede, interfere with, delay or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Merger or
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that this Section&nbsp;2 shall
be inapplicable if there has been a modification or amendment to the Merger Agreement which reduces

the parties acknowledge that this letter agreement is entered

&#147;<I>Parent Common Stock</I>&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Merger Agreement and discussed their

dispose of Parent Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the
Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<I>Transfers of Parent Common Stock</I>. I will not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition
of such Parent Common Stock unless (a)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered
under the Securities Act, (b)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with
the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act or (c)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent , or under a &#147;no action&#148; letter obtained by me from the
staff of the SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Securities Act.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<I>No Obligation to Register Parent Common Stock</I>. I understand that Parent is under no
obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Parent Common Stock by
me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make
compliance with an exemption from such registration available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<I>Stop Transfer Instructions</I>. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Parent&#146;s transfer agent with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result
of the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<I>Legend on Certificates</I>. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Parent Common
Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities Act or such
transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, Parent
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates
issued to my transferee:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under

shares in a transaction to which Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act of 1933
applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand and agree that the legends set forth in paragraph 3 or 4 above, as the case may
be, will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if I deliver to
Parent (a)&nbsp;a copy of a &#147;no action&#148; letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not
required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (b)&nbsp;evidence or representations reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that Parent Common Stock represented by such certificates is being or has
been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145(d).
