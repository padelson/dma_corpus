Effect on Stock; Election Procedures  

  

 3.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action by any holder of Company Stock: 

    

 (a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, will be converted into and constitute the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of Sections 3.2 and 3.3, either (i) the Per Share Stock Consideration or (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration together, the " _Consideration_ "). 

   

 Shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. Holders of Company Common Stock will cease to be, and will have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, and certificates that represented shares of Company Common Stock before the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent only the right to receive, without interest, (A) any then unpaid dividend or other distribution with respect to such Company Common Stock having a record date before the Effective Time and (B) the Consideration. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and shares of Company Common Stock presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent will be canceled and exchanged in accordance with this Article 3. 

   

 (b) _Parent Stock_. Each share of Parent Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding. 

  

 3.2 _Elections; Allocation_. (a) Subject to allocation in accordance with Section 3.2(b), each record holder of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Election Deadline will be entitled (1) to elect to receive in respect of each share of Company Common Stock (A) Per Share Cash Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ") or (B) Per Share Stock Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") or (2) to indicate that such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of Per Share Cash Consideration or Per Share Stock Consideration for each such share (a " _Non-Election_ "). Shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Non-Election is made (including shares with respect of which such an election is deemed to have been made pursuant to this Section 3.2 and Section 3.7) (collectively, " _Non-Election Shares_ ") will be deemed by the Parent, in its sole and absolute discretion, subject to Sections 3.2(b)(1), (2) and (3), to be, in whole or in part, shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Cash Elections or Stock Elections have been made. Dissenting Shares 

    ##### 

  

    

will, for purposes of this Agreement, be treated as shares of Company Common
Stock with respect to which Cash Elections have been made. 

    

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the rights of holders of Company Common Stock to make elections in respect of shares of Company Common Stock will be subject to the following principles of allocation: 

   

 (1) _Number of Stock Elections Less Than the Stock Conversion Number_. If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election is made (collectively, " _Stock Election Shares_ ") is less than the Stock Conversion Number, then: 

   

 (A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; 

   

 (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Non-Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of Non-Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Non-Election Shares, a sufficient number of Non-Election Shares so that the sum of such number and the number of Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each such allocated Non-Election Share (each, a " _Stock-Selected Non-Election Share_ ") will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, _provided_  that if the sum of all Non-Election Shares and Stock Election Shares is equal to or less than the Stock Conversion Number, then all Non-Election Shares will be Stock-Selected Non-Election Shares; 

   

 (C) if the sum of Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares is less than the Stock Conversion Number, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash Election is made (collectively, " _Cash Election Shares_ "), other than Cash Election Shares representing Dissenting Shares, pro rata to the holders of such Cash Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares so that the sum of such number, the number of all Stock Election Shares and the number of all Non-Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each such allocated Cash Election Share (each, a " _Converted Cash Election Share_ ") will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and 

   

 (D) each Non-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is not a Stock-Selected Non-Election Share or a Converted Cash Election Share (as the case may be) will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration. 

   

 (2) _Number of Stock Elections Greater Than the Stock Conversion Number_. If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares is greater than the Stock Conversion Number, then: 

   ##### 

  

   

 (A) each Cash Election Share and Non-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; 

   

 (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election Shares, pro rata to the holders of such Stock Election Shares in accordance with their respective numbers of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient number of Stock Election Shares (each, a " _Converted Stock Election Share_ ") so that the difference of (1) the number of Stock Election Shares minus (2) the number of the Converted Stock Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion Number, and each Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and 

   

 (C) each other Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration. 

   

 (3) _Number of Stock Elections is Equal to the Stock Conversion Number_. If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares is equal to the Stock Conversion Number, then: 

   

 (A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and 

   

 (B) each Cash Election Share and Non-Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration. 

  

 3.3 _Exchange Agent; Election Procedures_. (a) At or before the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with its transfer agent or with a depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected by it and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in such capacity, the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (" _Old Certificates_ "), (1) certificates or, at Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form (" _New Certificates_ "), representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to holders of Old Certificates under this Article 3 and (2) cash payable pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.4 (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

    

 (b) Elections pursuant to Section 3.2(a) will be made on a form and with such other provisions to be reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent (a " _Form of Election_ ") to be provided by the Exchange Agent for that purpose to holders of record of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares), together with appropriate transmittal materials, at the time of mailing of the Proxy Statement to the holders of record of Company Common Stock or on such other date as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree to each holder of record of Company Common Stock for purposes of the Company Meeting. Elections shall be made by mailing to the Exchange Agent a duly completed Form of 

   ##### 

  

   

Election. A Form of Election may specify which specific shares covered thereby
are subject to a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Non-Election. To be
effective, a Form of Election must be (1) properly completed, signed and
submitted to the Exchange Agent at its designated office, by 5:00 p.m., on
the day of the Company Meeting (or such other time and date as the Company
and Parent may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") and
(2) accompanied by the certificate(s) representing the shares of Company
Common Stock as to which the election is being made (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such certificate(s) by a commercial bank or trust
company in the United States or a member of a registered national security
exchange or of the NASD, _provided_ that such certificates are in fact
delivered to the Exchange Agent within three trading days after the date of
execution of such guarantee of delivery). Parent will determine, in its sole
and absolute discretion, which authority it may delegate in whole or in part
to the Exchange Agent, whether Forms of Election have been properly
completed, signed and submitted or revoked. The decision of Parent (or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall be conclusive
and binding. Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent will be under any
obligation to notify any person of any defect in a Form of Election submitted
to the Exchange Agent. A holder of shares of Company Common Stock that does
not submit an effective Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline shall
be deemed to have made a Non-Election. 

   

 (c) An election may be revoked, but only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any certificate(s) representing shares of Company Common Stock that have been submitted to the Exchange Agent in connection with an election shall be returned without charge to the holder thereof in the event such election is revoked as aforesaid and such holder requests in writing the return of such certificate(s). Upon any such revocation, unless a duly completed Form of Election is thereafter submitted in accordance with Section 3.3(b), such shares shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. 

   

 (d) The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent and the Company, will make all computations to give effect to Section 3.2(b). 

   

 (e) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, taking into account the computations contemplated by Section 3.2(b), each holder of record of Company Common Stock that has surrendered the certificates representing its Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive a New Certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor and/or a check representing cash payable pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.4. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any New Certificates or cash to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. If any New Certificate is to be issued or cash is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition to the exchange that the person requesting the exchange (1) pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of the New Certificate or the making of the cash payment in a name other than the name of the holder of the surrendered Old Certificate or (2) establish to the satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) that any such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. A Company Affiliate shall not be entitled to receive any 

   ##### 

  

   

New Certificate pursuant to this Article III until such Company Affiliate
shall have duly executed and delivered an appropriate agreement as described
in Section 6.13. 

   

 (f) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock and who theretofore has not submitted such holders Old Certificates with an Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such person may be entitled pursuant to this Article III. 

   

 (g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock having a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to any holder of Company Common Stock until such holder has surrendered the Old Certificate representing such stock as provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable law, following surrender of any such Old Certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of New Certificates issued in exchange therefor, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously payable with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby. To the extent permitted by law, holders of Company Common Stock who receive Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their respective shares of Company Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether such holders of Company Common Stock have exchanged their Old Certificates for New Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, but beginning 60 days after the Effective Time no such Holder shall be entitled to vote on any matter until such Holder surrenders such Old Certificate for exchange as provided in Section 3.3(b). 

  

 3.4 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Parent will pay to each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock by the last reported per share sale price of Parent Common Stock, as reported by the NYSE Composite Transactions Reporting System (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company), for the last NYSE trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 3.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to 

    ##### 

  

    

such certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and any
cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be payable or
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate been surrendered. 

   

 3.6 _Anti-Dilution Adjustments_. If Parent changes (or the Board of Directors of Parent sets a related record date that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, the Signing Exchange Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. 

   

 3.7 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Dissenting Shares that are outstanding as of the Effective Time will not be converted into the right to receive the Consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, its right to dissent from the Merger under applicable law and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of applicable law. If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right after the Election Deadline, each share of such holders Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as a Non-Election Share and will be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Per Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion. The Company will give Parent (a) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. Parent will pay any consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of applicable law.

As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any reason to believe that any conditions exist that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. No Liens for Taxes exist with respect to any of Parents assets or properties or those of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being contested in good faith and reserved for in accordance with GAAP. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party to any distribution occurring during the two-year period prior to the date of this Agreement in which the parties to such distribution treated the distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code applied, except for distributions occurring among members of the same group of affiliated corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return.

 (q) _Benefits_. (i) All of its Parent Benefit Arrangements, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws.

   ##### 

  

    

letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of
the Code, and it is not aware of any circumstances reasonably likely to
result in the loss of the qualification of such Parent Pension Plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code. Each Parent Benefit Arrangement that is intended
to be part of a voluntary employees beneficiary association within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has (A) received an opinion letter
from the IRS recognizing its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code
and (B) filed a timely notice with the IRS pursuant to Section 505(c) of the
Code, and it is not aware of circumstances likely to result in the loss of
the exempt status of such Parent Benefit Arrangement under Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of it, threatened,
litigation relating to its Parent Benefit Arrangements. Neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any of its
Parent Benefit Arrangements that, assuming the taxable period of such
transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject it or any of its
Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount that would be material. Neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax
or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA in an
amount that would be material. 

   

 (ii) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any of its Parent Benefit Arrangements have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each of its Parent Benefits Arrangements have been properly accrued or reflected on its most recent consolidated financial statements included in its Company SEC Filings. None of its Parent Pension Plans or any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and none of its ERISA Affiliates has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any of its Parent Pension Plans or to any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA Affiliates pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

ARTICLE 6 

   

Covenants  

  

 6.1 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, in good faith, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the Other Mergers as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each will cooperate fully with, and furnish information to, the other party to that end. In connection with the Companys and the Parents respective obligations to cooperate and cause the conversion of the operating systems of the Company Bank Sub to the operating systems of the Parent Bank Sub at the Effective Time, the Company shall, commencing as of the date of this Agreement, provide the Parent and Parent Bank Sub with full access to the Company Bank Subs offices, systems 

    ##### 

  

    

and facilities and all relevant information and personnel at such times and
places as Parent Bank Sub shall request (in connection therewith, the parties
shall cooperate towards causing the least possible disruption to the
Companys and Company Bank Subs employees, customers and operations), allow
the Parent Bank Sub to implement such changes as shall be reasonably
necessary to effect the conversion at the Effective Time and diligently
assist Parent Sub Bank in making and sending notices, information and
materials to the customers and service providers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries at such times as Parent deems appropriate and otherwise preparing
for the conversion. 

    

 (b) The Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article 7. 

  

 6.2 _Shareholder Approval_. (a) The Company Board has adopted resolutions recommending to the Companys shareholders approval of this Agreement, the Merger and any other matters required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

    

 (b) The Company Board will submit to its shareholders this Agreement, the Merger and any other matters required to be approved or adopted by such shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, the Company will take, in accordance with applicable law and its Constituent Documents, all action necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement, the " _Company Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement, the Merger and any such other matters. The Company and the Company Board will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders a vote approving this Agreement, the Merger and any such other matters, including by recommending that its shareholders vote in favor of this Agreement, the Merger and any such other matters. However, if the Company Board, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) counsel, determines in good faith that, because of the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it would result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger, then, in submitting this Agreement and the Merger to the Company Meeting, the Company Board may submit such items without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting such items prior to the date hereof, described in Section 6.2(a), may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ that the Company Board may not take any actions under this sentence until after giving Parent at least 10 business days to respond to such Acquisition Proposal (and after giving Parent notice of the third party in the Acquisition Proposal and the latest material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) and then taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Company. 

   ##### 

  

  

 6.3 _Regulatory Applications_. (a) The Company and Parent and their respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to prepare as promptly as practicable all documentation, to make all filings and to obtain all consents, approvals, permits and other authorizations of all Governmental Authorities and third parties to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Other Mergers (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), and Parent will make all necessary filings in respect of Requisite Regulatory Approvals of federal and state banking authorities within 45 days of the date hereof and Parent will make all other necessary filings in respect of Requisite Regulatory Approvals as promptly as practicable. Each of the Company and Parent will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

Each of Parent and the Company will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof and to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement until the Effective Time. Parent also agrees to use all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company agrees to furnish to Parent all information concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. 

    ##### 

  

      

 (b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (1) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (2) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. The Company and Parent each further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. 

   

 (c) Parent will advise the Company, promptly after Parent receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional information. 

  

 6.6 _Press Releases_. The Company and Parent will consult with each other before issuing any press release, written employee communication or other written shareholder communication with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such communication or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such communication or make such public statement as may be required by applicable law or securities exchange rules. The Company and Parent will cooperate to develop all public communications and make appropriate members of management available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably requested by the other party. 

   

 6.7 _Acquisition Proposals_. The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential non-public information to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Company Board concludes in good faith (and based on the advice of counsel) that failure to take such actions would result in a violation of its   ##### 

  

  

  

fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that, prior to providing any
nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing
proviso, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such
third party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality

of time). The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any persons other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce
any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal.

any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of
the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised
of any related developments on a current basis. 

   

 6.8 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. The Company will not take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and will take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. 

   

 6.9 _Access; Information_. (a) The Company agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parent, and Parents officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized Representatives, such access during normal business hours throughout the period before the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other information as Parent may reasonably request and, during such period, it will furnish promptly to Parent (1) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state banking or securities laws, and (2) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of it as Parent may reasonably request. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent final monthly general ledger reports for each month end beginning with April 30, 2006 until the Effective Time as promptly as they become available.

them in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take
such charges in accordance with GAAP, as may be mutually agreed upon in a
written agreement executed in the same manner as this agreement that
specifically references this Section 6.10. No partys representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be

Parent will cause each employee benefit plan of Parent in which employees of the Company as of the Effective Time are eligible to participate to take into account for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and level of benefits) thereunder (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan of Parent) the service of such employees with the Company as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company, and, with respect to welfare benefit plans of Parent in which employees of the Company are eligible to participate, Parent agrees to waive any preexisting conditions, waiting periods and actively at work requirements under such plans.

agreement that otherwise provides for severance, in which case severance
shall be specifically governed by such agreement. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.12, (1) in accordance with the terms of the Parent Profit Sharing Plans, employees of the Company will not be eligible to accrue benefits under such plans until the first year in which such employees are employed by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent as of January 1 of such year and (2) in no event will employees of the Company be entitled to receive benefits under the Parent Non-Contributory Defined Benefit Plans, which were frozen effective December 31, 2001.

 (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.14(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, will promptly notify Parent; _provided_ that failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of Parent under Section 6.14(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence. 

   

 (c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of directors and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from fact or events which occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Company; _provided,_ that in 

   ##### 

  

    

no event shall the Parent be required to expend more than 200 percent of the
current amount expended by the Company (the " _Current Premium_ ") to
maintain or procure such directors and officers insurance coverage for a
comparable six-year period; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if Parent is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section
6.14(c), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Current Premium; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that officers and directors of the Company or any subsidiary may
be required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to the responsible insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance.

If Parent makes an election contemplated by the preceding sentence, within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to the Company of such election and the revised Signing Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.2 and this Plan shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Signing Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any references in this Agreement to "Signing Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Signing Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this Section 8.2. 

  

 If any company belonging to the PHLX/KBW Bank Index or Parent declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date hereof and the Determination Date, the values or prices for such index or the common stock of Parent, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 8.2. 

  

 8.3 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. If this Agreement is terminated and the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned, no party will have any liability or further obligation under this Agreement, except that the first sentence of Section 5.3(i), Section 5.4(h), Section 6.9(c), this Section 8.3, Section 8.4 and Article 9, as well as any relevant definitions, will survive termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect and except that termination will not relieve a party from liability for any willful breach by it of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Voting Agreements will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

   

 8.4 _Fee_. (a) The Company will pay to Parent a cash termination fee (the " _Fee_ ") of $13,750,000 (Thirteen Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars) if a Fee Payment Event occurs prior to or concurrently with the Fee Termination Date. 

    ##### 

  

      

 (b) The Fee will be payable, without setoff, by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to an account specified by Parent, not later than three business days following the first occurrence of a Fee Payment Event. 

   

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.

 San Antonio, Texas 78205  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

(" _Parent_ ") are concurrently entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 2, 2006 (as amended or modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which the Company will be merged with and into Parent (the " _Merger_ "). A copy of the Merger Agreement has been provided to the undersigned. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are to be deemed to have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 The undersigned further acknowledges that the undersigned will benefit directly and substantially from the consummation of the Merger. As an inducement to and condition of Parents willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, the undersigned hereby agrees, represents and warrants as follows: 

   

 1. _Owned Shares_. The undersigned owns (of record or beneficially) and has the full power and authority to vote the number of shares of Company Common Stock set forth on the signature page hereof (the " _Owned Shares_ "). For all purposes of this agreement, the Owned Shares will include any shares of Company Common Stock as to which the undersigned acquires beneficial ownership after the date hereof, including any shares obtained by exercising any Company Stock Options. 

  

 2. _Agreement to Vote Owned Shares_. The undersigned irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that at the Company Meeting or any other meeting or action of the shareholders of the Company, including a written consent solicitation, the undersigned will (1) vote all of the Owned Shares (or otherwise provide a proxy or consent) in favor of, and will otherwise support, approval of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and any other matters required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (2) not vote the Owned Shares (or otherwise provide a proxy or consent) in favor of, or otherwise support, approval of any Acquisition Proposal or any action that is intended to, or could reasonably be expected to, materially impede, interfere with, delay or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that this Section 2 shall be inapplicable if there has been a modification or amendment to the Merger Agreement which reduces the Per Share Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that this letter agreement is entered 

   ##### 

  

 

into by the undersigned solely in his capacity as beneficial owner of the
Owned Shares and that nothing in this letter agreement shall prevent the
undersigned from discharging his fiduciary duties as a member of the board of
directors of Summit Bancshares, Inc. 

   

 3. _Transfer of Owned Shares_. The undersigned agrees that the undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) (a) directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract, option, commitment or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Owned Shares, except for gifts that represent less than 10% of the undersigneds holdings of Company Common Stock, and gifts that are made consistent in amounts and terms with past practices, unless it receives (i) an irrevocable proxy, in form and substance identical to the provisions of Section 2 hereof, to vote such Owned Shares with respect to the Merger Agreement and the Merger and otherwise, and the undersigned will vote such proxy as provided in Section 2 hereof and (ii) an agreement identical in all material respects to this letter agreement executed by the transferee of the Owned Shares the subject thereof, and (b) take any action or omit to take any action which would prohibit, prevent or preclude the undersigned from performing its obligations under this letter agreement. 

  

 4. _Further Assurances_. The undersigned will take all reasonable actions and make all reasonable efforts, and will execute and deliver all such further documents, certificates and instruments, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, the agreement of the undersigned to vote the Owned Shares in accordance with Section 2 hereof. 

  

 5. _No Solicitation._ The undersigned agrees that neither the undersigned nor, if applicable, any of the undersigneds subsidiaries nor any of the respective officers and directors of the undersigned or its subsidiaries shall, and the undersigned shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the undersigneds employees, agents and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) not to, knowingly initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making of any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 6. _Specific Performance_. The undersigned agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this agreement were not performed by the undersigned in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the undersigned agrees that Parent will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches hereof by the undersigned and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent is entitled at law or in equity, and that the undersigned waives the posting of any bond or security in connection with any proceeding related thereto.

   ##### 

  

 

Inc. pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Merger Agreement. Upon such termination,
no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder;
provided, however, such termination will not relieve any party from liability
for any willful breach of this agreement prior to such termination. 

   

 8. _Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not confer any rights on Parent with respect to any Owned Shares if such rights, in combination with any and all other rights Parent may have in shares of Company Common Stock or rights thereto, would result in Parent beneficially owning under any relevant definition thereof 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 9. _Governing Law_. This agreement is governed by, and will be interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within that State. 

  

 10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to constitute an original, and may be delivered by facsimile or other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic or pictorial appearance of a document.

FORM OF COMPANY AFFILIATE LETTER 

   

 July 2, 2006  

  

Summit Bancshares, Inc. 
 3880 Hulen Street 
 Fort Worth, Texas 76107  

  

Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. 
 100 West Houston Street 
 San Antonio, Texas 78205  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Summit Bancshares, Inc. (" _Company_ "), as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). I understand that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 2, 2006 (as amended or modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), between the Company and Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (" _Parent_ "), the Company has agreed to merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_ "). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are to be deemed to have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 I further understand that as a result of the Merger, I may receive common stock of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "). 

   

 I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Merger Agreement and discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Company. 

   

 I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

   

 1. _Transfers of Parent Common Stock_. I will not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such Parent Common Stock unless (a) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (b) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or (c) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent , or under a "no action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2. _No Obligation to Register Parent Common Stock_. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 

  

 3. _Stop Transfer Instructions_. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents transfer agent with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

   

 "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc." 

  

 4. _Legend on Certificates_. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Securities Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, Parent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

   

 "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933." 

  

 I understand and agree that the legends set forth in paragraph 3 or 4 above, as the case may be, will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if I deliver to Parent (a) a copy of a "no action" letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act, or (b) evidence or representations reasonably satisfactory to Parent that Parent Common Stock represented by such certificates is being or has been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d). 

   

 By signing this letter agreement, without limiting or abrogating the agreements that I have made as set forth above, I do not admit that I am an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and I do not waive any right that I may have to object to any assertion that I am an affiliate. 

    ##### 

  

     

 This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. This letter agreement shall terminate if and when the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

   

 This letter agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to constitute an original, and may be delivered by facsimile or other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic or pictorial appearance of a document. 

   

Very truly yours,
