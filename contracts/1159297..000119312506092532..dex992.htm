ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE AND SALE

Section 2.01. _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each Seller agrees to sell and transfer to Buyer
or Buyers permitted assignees, and Buyer agrees to purchase and acquire or to
cause its permitted assignees to purchase and acquire from such Seller,
such Sellers Company Shares at the Closing. The aggregate purchase price
(the "Purchase Price") for all of the Company Shares is $709,950,000. The
Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.02, and shall be
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.04. Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate to reach an agreement regarding the allocation of the Purchase Price
among the Company Shares. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to reach an
agreement regarding the allocation of the Purchase Price within six months
after the Closing Date, Sellers,



 

10 on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, may each use
their own allocation of the Purchase Price; _provided_ , that, if Applicable
Law in a jurisdiction in which a Company is organized requires an agreed
allocation of the Purchase Price to the shares of such Company, the parties
shall agree to such allocation within the period required by Applicable Law.

Section 2.02. _Closing_. (a) The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and
sale of the Company Shares hereunder shall take place at the offices of Davis
Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, on the last day of
the month (the "Month End Date") in which the conditions set forth in Article
11 are satisfied (or waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions) or, if the Month End Date is not a Business Day, the first
Business Day thereafter, or at such other time or place as Buyer and Sellers
may agree.

(b) At the Closing:

(i) Buyer shall, on behalf of itself and as agent for its permitted assignees,
deliver to the Seller Representative, as agent for the Sellers, the Purchase
Price in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by Seller Representative (as agent for the Sellers), by notice to
Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not later than two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date (or if not so designated, then by certified or official
bank check payable in immediately available funds to the order of Seller
Representative in such amount).

(ii) Each Seller shall deliver to Buyer or Buyers permitted assignees
certificates for such Sellers Company Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by
stock powers duly endorsed in blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed
thereto.

(iii) Each party hereto shall execute and deliver each of the following
agreements (the "Ancillary Agreements") to which it is a party:

(A) the Transition Services Agreement between SG Corporation and Buyer
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto;

(B) the Third Amendment to the Lease Agreement between SG Vidros and Saint-
Gobain Calmar Brasil Ltda, a Brazilian corporation, relating to the portion
of SG Vidross facility at 394 Santa Marina Avenue, Sao Paulo, Brazil,
currently used by Saint-Gobain Calmar Brasil Ltda, substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit C hereto;



 

11 (C) the License Agreement between Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics
Corporation, a California corporation, and Saint-Gobain Calmar Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Calmar Delaware"), relating to the technology referred
to in Section 6.10, to be licensed to Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics
Corporation, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-1 hereto; and

(D) the Supply Agreement between Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics
Corporation, a California corporation, and Calmar Delaware, relating to the
supply of tubing for use in connection with the technology referred to in
Section 6.10 substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D-2 hereto.

Section 2.03 _. Closing Balance Sheet._ (a) As promptly as practicable, but no
later than 90 days, after the Closing Date, Seller Representative will cause
to be prepared and delivered to Buyer an audited combined balance sheet of the
Companies and Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(or, if the Closing Date does not fall on the Month End Date, the Month End
Date) (such audited combined balance sheet, the "Closing Balance Sheet"),
together with a certificate based on such Closing Balance Sheet setting forth
Seller Representatives calculations of (i) Closing Debt, (ii) Closing Cash
and (ii) Closing Working Capital along with the supporting details and working
papers for those calculations. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the
audit shall be conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, with the costs of the
audit to be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand. The Closing Balance Sheet shall (x) be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with that used in the preparation of the
Balance Sheet, (y) be prepared in accordance with accounting policies and
practices consistent with those used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet
and (z) include line items substantially consistent with those in the Balance
Sheet, except as set forth in Schedule 2.03(a). For the purposes of this
Section 2.03, to the extent practicable, in the Seller Representatives
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer and its advisors, shall be (1)
permitted to observe inventory counts and reviewing asset and liability
values, (2) permitted to review the working papers of the audit of the Closing
Balance Sheet once delivered in accordance with this Section 2.03(a), and (3)
informed by the Sellers of GAAP adjustments; in each case at Buyers own
expense.

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Seller Representatives calculations of
Closing Debt, Closing Cash or Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
Section 2.03(a), Buyer may, within 30 days after delivery of the documents
referred to in Section 2.03(a), deliver a notice to Seller Representative
disagreeing with such calculation of Closing Debt, Closing Cash or Closing
Working Capital, as the case may be, setting forth Buyers calculation of such
amount of Closing



 

12 Debt, Closing Cash or Closing Working Capital, as the case may be, and in
reasonable detail Buyers grounds for such disagreement. Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees,
and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of Closing Debt,
Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section
2.03(a).

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.03(b), Buyer and Seller Representative shall, during the 30 days following
such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as applicable, the amount of
Closing Debt, Closing Cash or Closing Working Capital. If, during such period,
Buyer and Seller Representative are unable to reach such agreement, they shall
promptly thereafter cause Deloitte and Touche (or such other independent
accountants mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller Representative) promptly to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating Closing Debt, Closing Cash or Closing Working Capital, as the
case may be. In making such calculation, such independent accountants shall
consider only those items or amounts in Closing Debt, Closing Cash or Closing
Working Capital, as the case may be, as to which Buyer has disagreed. Such
independent accountants shall deliver to Buyer and Seller Representative, as
promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation. Such report
shall be final and binding upon Buyer and all Sellers. The aggregate costs of
any such review and report arising out of disagreements over Closing Debt,
Closing Cash or Closing Working Capital shall be borne (i) by Sellers if (x)
the aggregate difference between (A) Final Debt, Final Cash and Final Working
Capital and (B) Seller Representatives calculations of the Closing Debt,
Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital, respectively, delivered pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) is greater than (y) the aggregate difference between (A) Final
Debt, Final Cash and Final Working Capital and (B) Buyers calculations of
Closing Debt, Closing Cash and Closing Working Capital, respectively,
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b), (ii) by Buyer if the first such
difference is less than the second such difference or (iii) otherwise equally
by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.

(d) Buyer and Sellers agree that they will, and Buyer agrees to cause each
Company and Subsidiary to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of Closing Debt, Closing Cash and
Closing Working Capital and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this
Section 2.03, including making available to the extent necessary books,
records, work papers and personnel.

Section 2.04 _. Adjustment of Purchase Price._ (a) If Reference Working
Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, Seller Representative, as agent for the
Sellers, shall pay to Buyer, on behalf of itself and as agent for its
permitted 



 

13 assignees, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.04(d), the amount of such excess. If Final
Working Capital exceeds Reference Working Capital, Buyer shall, on behalf of
itself and as agent for its assignees, pay to Seller Representative, as agent
for the Sellers, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section
2.04(d), the amount of such excess. Sellers obligations pursuant to this
Section 2.04(a) shall be joint and several.

(b) Seller Representative, as agent for the Sellers, shall pay to Buyer, on
behalf of itself and as agent for its permitted assignees, as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, the amount of Final Debt, in the manner and with interest
as provided in Section 2.04(d). Sellers obligations pursuant to this Section
2.04(b) shall be joint and several.

(c) Buyer, on behalf of itself and as agent for its permitted assignees, shall
pay to Seller Representative, as agent for the Sellers, as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price, the amount of Final Cash, in the manner and with interest
as provided in Section 2.04(d).

(d) The parties agree that the aggregate amount of any payment required to be
made pursuant to Sections 2.04(a), 2.04(b) or 2.04(c) shall be netted against
each other payment required to be made pursuant to any of such Sections. Any
such net payment shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place, within
20 days after Final Debt, Final Cash and Final Working Capital have been
determined, by delivery by Buyer or Seller Representative (on behalf of
Sellers), as the case may be, of a certified or official bank check payable in
immediately available funds to Seller Representative or Buyer (as the case
may be) or by causing such payments to be credited to such account of such
other party as may be designated by such other party. The amount of such net
payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.04(d) shall bear interest from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing
Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time
as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis
of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

(e) If it is discovered during the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet
that the Balance Sheet was not prepared in accordance with GAAP, the
parties agree that the Balance Sheet and the Reference Working Capital shall
be restated in accordance with GAAP for the sole purpose of calculating the
purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section 2.03 and this Section 2.04 and
for no other purpose, and references to those terms in this Section 2.04
shall be to those amounts as restated. The parties agree that the purchase
price adjustment to



 

14 be made pursuant to this Section 2.04 will not include items that are not part
of the Closing Working Capital and Final Working Capital calculations. Except
as otherwise contemplated in this Section 2.04(e), neither Section 2.03 nor
Section 2.04 is intended to be used to adjust for errors or omissions that may
be found with respect to the Balance Sheet or any inconsistencies between the
Balance Sheet and GAAP, for which Article 12 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy.

information, documents or other materials received by such party hereto from
any Governmental Authority in respect of such filings under any applicable
Antitrust Law, and (iii) take all other actions necessary to cause the

approval, as the case may be, under any such Antitrust Law as soon as
practicable. 



 

44 (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any action, suit or other
proceeding is instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law, Buyer and Sellers shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts promptly to resolve such objections. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and, if requested by Buyer, Sellers,
shall agree to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses or properties
or assets of any such Company or Subsidiary, as may be required (i) by the
applicable Governmental Authority in order to resolve such objections as such
Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under any Antitrust Law,
or (ii) by any domestic or foreign court or other tribunal, in any action,
suit or other proceeding brought by a private party or Governmental Authority
challenging such transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law, in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering
or reversal of, any order that has the effect of restricting, preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that (A) nothing shall obligate Buyer or Sellers to
take any such action if (x) any such action could reasonably be expected to
cause a Material Adverse Effect, or (y) any such action is not conditional on
the consummation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B)
Sellers shall not take or offer to take any such action without first
obtaining the consent of Buyer, and (C) if Buyer or Sellers are required to
take any action in accordance with Section 8.03(c) and the option of choosing
such action to offer to take or the action to take is available, Buyer retains
the right to choose the action to offer to take and/or the action to take,
_provided_ that, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to take any such action over and above the minimum actions required
by any Government Authority or domestic or foreign court or other tribunal.
For the avoidance of doubt, (x) in no event shall Buyer be entitled to any
reduction in the Purchase Price as a result of it having to take any of the
actions described in the immediately preceding sentence and (y) Buyer shall be
entitled to receive the net proceeds (after fees, expenses and other
transaction costs) and any other consideration received in the event either
Buyer or Sellers are required to take any of the actions described in the
immediately preceding sentence.

(d) Buyer and Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
keep the other parties informed in all material respects with respect to
any communication given or received in connection with any filing,
submission, investigation or proceeding relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby.



 

45 Section 8.03. _Public Announcements_. Each of Buyer and Sellers agrees to
consult, in the case of Buyer with Seller Representative, and in the case of
Sellers with Buyer, before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and agrees not to issue any such press release or make any such public
statement without the prior consent of Seller Representative or Buyer (as the
case may be), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_
that Buyer or Sellers may without the consent of the other party (or parties,
as applicable) issue any such press release or public statement if such party
has used reasonable best efforts to consult with Seller Representative or
Buyer (as the case may be) and to obtain the consent of the other such
party but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or
public statement is required to be released pursuant to Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with any applicable national or foreign securities exchange.

Section 8.04 _. Insurance._ (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section
8.04, the Companies and Subsidiaries shall be entitled to coverage for losses
suffered by them arising out of occurrences occurring prior to the Closing to
the extent such occurrences are covered under the terms and conditions of any
"occurrence" based Insurance Policy ("Occurrence Based Policy") maintained by
any Seller or SG Corporation as of the date hereof.

(b)With respect to any claims made under any Occurrence Based Policy, Buyer
and Sellers agree as follows:

(i) Sellers, their Affiliates or the third party claims administrators of
such Occurrence Based Policies shall continue to administer, adjust, settle
and pay, on behalf of the Companies and Subsidiaries, all such claims with
dates of occurrence prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that Sellers shall
obtain the prior written consent of Buyer before settling any claims (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) that would be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Sellers, their Affiliates and Buyer
shall cooperate in the administration of all such claims, and Sellers and
their Affiliates shall, and shall procure that third party claims
administrators shall, permit the Buyer to participate, to the extent
practicable, in the administration of any such claim. Buyer shall provide,
and shall cause each Company and Subsidiary to provide, Sellers and their
Affiliates with all records and other information necessary for any such
purposes, including the reporting, investigation, negotiation, and
if applicable, prosecution of any such claim.

(ii) Buyer shall be responsible for any and all retention, deductible or
similar amounts that may be payable under the terms of such



 

46 policies in respect of any such claims and any and all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses that may be incurred or suffered by any Company or Subsidiary or any
Seller or an Affiliate thereof in connection therewith, including fees of any
third party claims administrator, fees and expenses of counsel, allocated loss
adjustment expenses within applicable retention and deductible limits and
allocated loss adjustment expenses not otherwise covered by such policies.

(iii) Sellers shall, or shall cause a third party claims administrator to
invoice, Buyer at the end of each month for any such amounts paid by Sellers,
and Buyer shall pay or cause the Companies to pay such invoiced amounts within
10 days after the invoice date. If such invoiced amounts are not paid within
10 days after the invoice date, Sellers and their Affiliates shall be entitled
to interest thereon at a rate of 7.0% per annum from the invoice date until
such invoiced amounts are paid.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.15, neither any Seller nor SG Corporation
makes any representation or warranty with respect to the applicability or
adequacy of any Occurrence Based Policy, and neither any Seller nor SG
Corporation shall be responsible to Buyer or its Affiliates for the decision
of any insurer not to pay under any such Occurrence Based Policy.

(d)Nothing in this Agreement is intended to provide or shall be construed as
providing a benefit or release to any insurer or claims service organization
of any obligation under any Occurrence Based Policy. Nothing in this Section
8.04 shall be construed as creating or permitting any insurer or claims
service organization the right of subrogation against any Seller, SG
Corporation, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates in respect of
payments made by one to the other under any Occurrence Based Policy. Each of
Buyer and Sellers agree to waive for itself and its insurer subrogation rights
against each other. 

Section 8.05 _. Workers Compensation._ (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to, and cause its Affiliates (including the Companies and
Subsidiaries) to, take or cause to be taken any and all reasonable actions and
do or cause to be done any and all things reasonably necessary and desirable,
to cause Sellers and their Affiliates to be released as of the Closing Date
(or if not possible, as soon as practicable thereafter) from any and all
liabilities and obligations with respect to or arising from workers
compensation matters in respect of any Company Employee relating to the period
on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Workers Compensation
Liabilities").

(b)Following the Closing, Buyer shall reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates
for any and all Pre-Closing Workers Compensation Liabilities and any



 

47 related costs and expenses incurred or suffered by any Seller or an Affiliate
thereof after the Closing Date as soon as practicable following Buyers
receipt of reasonable documentation of such costs to Sellers.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to obtain for the benefit of Sellers and their Affiliates an
irrevocable letter of credit or provide other credit support reasonably
satisfactory to Sellers for the purpose of securing the payment of Buyers
reimbursement obligations under Section 8.05(b).

Section 8.06. _Release of Lease Guaranty._ Buyer and SG Corporation shall use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain the release, before Closing, of SG
Corporation from any and all guaranty or other obligations in respect of the
Grandview, Missouri property leased by Calmar Delaware. If such release
is not obtained before Closing, Buyer and SG Corporation shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such release after Closing and Buyer shall
indemnify SG Corporation from any loss that it may suffer as a result of its
guaranty and other obligations under such property lease with respect to
events, costs or liabilities relating to such lease and attributable to the
period subsequent to the Closing, provided that, except as set forth in
Section 8.01(c) hereof, in no event shall Buyer be required to pay any
consideration, post any security or make any other material concession to the
landlord in connection with obtaining such release of guaranty.

Section 8.07 _. No Hire of Employees._ (a) No Seller or any of its Affiliates
or any of their respective representatives on their behalf will at any time
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, directly or indirectly,
solicit the employment or services of, or hire in any capacity (whether as an
officer, director, employee, accountant, counsel, consultant, advisor, agent,
other representative or otherwise), any Company Employee without Buyers
prior written consent, other than a Company Employee that has been terminated
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing, and other than the
individuals set forth on Schedule 8.07(a); _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not prohibit any generalized searches for employees through media
advertisements of general circulation, employment firms, open job fairs or
otherwise that are not focused or targeted on any Company Employee employed by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or the incidental hiring of any individual as
a result thereof.

(b)None of Buyer nor any of its Affiliates nor any of their respective
representatives on their behalf will at any time prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, solicit the
employment or services of, or hire in any capacity (whether as an officer,
director, employee, accountant, counsel, consultant, advisor, agent, other
representative or otherwise), any employee of any Seller or any of their
Affiliates (i) employed in connection with any



 

48 packaging business of the Seller or such Affiliate or (ii) of whom the Buyer
became aware of in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case, without Seller Representatives prior written
consent, other than any such employee that has been terminated by any Seller
or any of its Affiliates after the Closing; _provided_  that the foregoing
shall not prohibit any generalized searches for employees through media
advertisements of general circulation, employment firms, open job fairs or
otherwise that are not focused or targeted on any employee employed by any
Seller or any of their Affiliates or the incidental hiring of any individual
as a result thereof.

Section 8.08 _. Consideration of Alternative Treatments of Intercompany
Accounts._ Buyer agrees to cooperate in good faith with Sellers to consider
alternative mechanisms relating to the treatment of Intercompany Accounts. If
the parties agree that there is a mutually acceptable alternative to the
covenant of the Sellers under Section 6.04(a) relating to the treatment of the
Intercompany Accounts which does not, and is not reasonably expected to, cause
an adverse impact for any of the Buyer or Sellers when compared with
the actions contemplated by Section 6.04(a), including in respect of any tax,
finance, legal, accounting or other considerations, the parties shall agree to
amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of reflecting those changes to the
manner in which the Purchase Price is paid and the Intercompany Accounts are
dealt with.

Section 9.03 _. Tax Returns._ (a) _ Combined and Consolidated Returns_.
Sellers and Seller Representative shall timely prepare and file, or cause to
be timely prepared and filed, all Returns of any Seller Group that include any
Company or Subsidiary. Sellers shall provide Buyer with a copy of the portion
of any such Return that relates to any Company or Subsidiary within 30 days
after the filing of such Return. Such Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with past practice to the extent that any failure to do so could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, the Companies or Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing
Period) that is material; provided that any change to the allocation between
the Seller Group, on the one hand, and the Companies and Subsidiaries that
were members of the Seller Group, on the other hand, of Tax attributes
required to be allocated pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 1502 of the Code (other than Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-9)
shall not be deemed to result in an adverse effect that is material for
purposes of this Section 9.03(a). Buyer shall cause each Company and
Subsidiary to elect, where permitted by Applicable Law, to carry forward any
Tax Asset arising in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date that
would, absent such election, be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in
which the Company or Subsidiary was included in a Federal Tax Return or
Combined Tax Return. Subject to Buyers covenant in the immediately preceding
sentence, where any Company or Subsidiary is permitted to carry back a Tax
Asset arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Sellers shall file, at Buyers reasonable request, any amended Federal Tax
Return or Combined Tax Return in order to claim any refund of Taxes to which
Buyer is entitled pursuant to Section 9.03(e).

(b) _Standalone Pre-Closing Period Returns._  Sellers shall timely prepare
and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Returns with respect
to the Companies and Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or
before



 

54 the Closing Date. Such Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
past practice to the extent that any failure to do so could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Companies or Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Period) that is
material. In the case of any Return prepared by Sellers pursuant to
this Section 9.03(b) for which the position taken with respect to any Tax
item could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the Tax
liability of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Companies or Subsidiaries
for a Post-Closing Tax Period) that is material, Sellers shall provide Buyer
with a copy of such Return at least twenty days prior to the due date of such
Return for Buyers review and comments. Any Return prepared by Sellers and
required to be filed by Buyer or a Company or Subsidiary after the Closing
shall be furnished by Sellers to Buyer or the appropriate Company or
Subsidiary, as the case may be, for signature and filing at least twenty days
prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Return, and
Buyer or the applicable Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall
promptly sign and timely file any such Return; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Buyer nor any Company or Subsidiary shall be required to file any
such Return not prepared in accordance with this Agreement and, _provided_ ,
_further_ , that signing and filing any such Return in accordance with this
Section 9.03(b) shall not be considered an acknowledgement that such Return
complies with the requirements of this Agreement. Buyer shall not file any
amended Return with respect to the Companies or Subsidiaries for any taxable
period that ends on or before the Closing Date without Seller Representatives
written approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).

(c) _Straddle Period Returns._ Except as otherwise required by Section
9.03(a), Buyer shall timely prepare and file or cause to be timely prepared
and filed, on a basis consistent with past practice, all Returns with respect
to any Company or Subsidiary for any taxable period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date. With respect to any tax period for which Buyer
has the obligation to file Returns pursuant to this Section 9.03(c), Sellers
shall, upon Buyers written request, promptly prepare and provide to Buyer a
package of any Tax information materials that are not otherwise reasonably
available to Buyer, including schedules and work papers, reasonably required
by Buyer to enable Buyer to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, all such Returns. Such package of Tax information materials shall be
completed in accordance with past practice. Sellers shall cause such package
of Tax information materials to be delivered to Buyer at least 90 days prior
to the due date of the relevant Return, including all available extensions.
Buyer shall furnish all material Returns prepared pursuant to this Section
9.03(c) to Sellers for their comments and approval (which approval shall not
be unreasonably delayed or withheld) at least twenty days prior to the due
date (including extensions) for the filing of such Returns.



 

55 (d) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements._ Anything in any other agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, all liabilities and obligations between
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Companies and
the Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any Company or Subsidiary, on the
other hand, under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement in effect on or
prior to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement) shall cease and
terminate as of the Closing Date, and no party shall have any further rights
or obligations under any such Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement for any
past or future period.

(e) _Refunds._ Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.03(e), Buyer
shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller Representative all refunds
of Taxes, including any interest paid by a Taxing Authority with respect to
such refund, actually received, or applied against a Tax liability for any
taxable period, by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, any Company or any
Subsidiary attributable to Taxes paid by any Seller, Company or Subsidiary (or
any predecessor or Affiliate of any Seller) with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, except to the extent such refund was reflected as an asset in
Final Working Capital. Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes that
relates to a carry-back of any item of loss, deduction or credit that arises
in any Post-Closing Tax Period. Except as otherwise provided in
the immediately preceding sentence, any refunds of Taxes of the Companies or
Subsidiaries for any taxable period that begins on or before and ends after
the Closing Date shall be equitably apportioned between Sellers and Buyer in
accordance with the principles set forth in Section 9.06(e). Any refunds of
Taxes of the Companies or Subsidiaries for any taxable period beginning after
the Closing Date shall be for the account of Buyer. Each party shall forward,
and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party entitled pursuant to
this Section 9.03(e) to a refund of Taxes, the amount of such refund within
ten (10) days after such refund is actually received or applied against
another Tax liability, as the case may be, in each case net of any costs to
the party receiving such refund.

(f) _Transfer Taxes._ All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) ("Transfer Taxes") imposed in connection with the purchase and
sale of the Company Shares (or the conveyance of any other asset) pursuant to
this Agreement (including any real property transfer Tax and any similar
Tax), and any notarial fees in connection therewith, shall be borne and paid
equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, regardless
of which party is responsible for such Tax under Applicable Law. Buyer and
Sellers shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of all necessary Returns
and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if
required by Applicable Law, Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Returns and other documentation.



 

56 Section 9.04 _. Procedures Related to Tax Claims._ (a) If a notice of
deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination,
administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a "Tax
Claim") is received from any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes for which
one party to this Agreement may be entitled to indemnification from another
party, the party receiving the notice shall notify the other party in writing
of the Tax Claim within ten days of receipt thereof; provided, that any
failure timely to notify the other party shall not relieve the indemnifying
party from its obligations under Section 9.06 except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.04(c), if any Tax Claim is
delivered, sent, commenced or initiated against any of the Companies or
the Subsidiaries by any Taxing Authority, Buyer shall be solely responsible
for controlling the defense of such Tax Claim; provided, that, if such Tax
Claim relates to a taxable period that, with respect to a Company or
Subsidiary, begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date or relates to
a Tax Claim for which Sellers are required to indemnify Buyer: (i) Buyer shall
keep Seller Representative fully informed of any proceedings, events and
developments related to or in connection with such Tax Claim; (ii) Seller
Representative shall be entitled to receive copies of all correspondence with
any Taxing Authority and documents related to such Tax Claim; (iii) Buyer
shall consult with Seller Representative and shall not enter into any
settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim that is reasonably likely to
have an adverse effect on Sellers that is material without Seller
Representatives prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld; and (iv) at Sellers own cost and expense,
Seller Representative shall have the right to participate in (but not control)
the defense of any such Tax Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that Buyer wishes to settle a Tax Claim that relates to a taxable period
which, with respect to a Company or Subsidiary, begins on or before and ends
after the Closing Date, and Seller Representative withholds its consent,
Seller Representative shall take over control of the Tax Claim at Sellers
cost and expense and, to the extent that the amount of the Tax Claim
ultimately is determined to be greater than the amount for which Buyer was
willing to settle, Sellers shall bear such excess cost. Except as provided in
the preceding sentence, the costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred by Buyer in contesting any such Tax Claim shall be borne by
Buyer. Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate with Buyer in
connection with any such Tax Claim.

(c) If a Tax Claim in respect of a Company or Subsidiary relates to a taxable
period that, with respect to such Company or Subsidiary, ends on or before
the Closing Date (other than a Federal Tax Return or Combined Tax Return),
Seller Representative shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect



 

57 to control, defend, settle, compromise, or contest such Tax Claim; provided,
however, that, if Seller Representative so elects, (i) Seller Representative
shall keep Buyer fully informed of any proceedings, events and developments
related to or in connection with such Tax Claim; (ii) Buyer shall be entitled
to receive copies of all correspondence and documents related to such Tax
Claim; (iii) Seller Representative shall consult with Buyer and shall not
enter into any settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim that is
reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and Subsidiaries) that
is material and for which Sellers have no obligation to indemnify Buyer
without Buyers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed or withheld; and (iv) at its own cost and expense, Buyer shall have
the right to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Tax
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Seller
Representative wishes to settle a Tax Claim and Buyer withholds its consent,
Buyer shall take over control of the Tax Claim (other than a Tax Claim
relating to Federal Taxes or Combined Taxes) at its own cost and expense and,
to the extent that the amount of the Tax Claim ultimately is determined to be
greater than the amount for which Seller Representative was willing to settle,
Buyer shall bear such excess cost. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, the costs and expenses (including the cost of counsel) incurred by
Sellers in contesting any such Tax Claim shall be borne by Sellers. Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Companies and Subsidiaries after the Closing)
shall cooperate with Seller Representative in connection with any such Tax
Claim. Seller Representative shall have the right to control, defend, settle,
compromise, or contest any Tax Claim relating to a Federal Tax Return or
Combined Tax Return; provided, that if such Tax Claim could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Companies and Subsidiaries in a Post-Closing Period) that is
material, (i) Seller Representative shall keep Buyer fully informed of any
proceedings, events and developments related to or in connection with such
Tax Claim; (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to receive copies of all
correspondence and documents related to such Tax Claim; and (iii) Seller
Representative shall conduct such Tax Claim diligently and in good faith as if
it were the only party in interest in connection with such Tax Claim.

Section 9.05 _. Cooperation on Tax Matters._ Buyer and Sellers agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) (and
including records relating to withholding and payment of income and
unemployment Taxes and FICA Taxes with respect to wages paid to employees of
the Companies and the Subsidiaries during the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs, including IRS Forms W-4) and assistance relating to the
Companies as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Return (including
any report required pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder), action, for the preparation for any
audit, and for the prosecution or



 

58 defense of any claim, action, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed
adjustment. Buyer and Sellers agree to retain or cause to be retained all
books and records pertinent to the Companies and Subsidiaries until the
applicable period for assessment under Applicable Law (giving effect to any
and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause
the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority. Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Companies and Subsidiaries to give Seller Representative reasonable notice
prior to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and records
relating to Tax matters and, if Seller Representative so requests, each
Company and Subsidiary shall allow Seller Representative to take possession of
such books and records. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with each other in
the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the Companies for any
Tax purposes and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and
other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section
9.05. Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish Buyer,
prior to the Closing Date with the information set forth in Schedule 9.05.

Section 9.06 _. Tax Indemnification_. __ (a) Each Seller and SG Corporation,
on a joint and several basis together with each other Seller, agrees to
indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Companies and Subsidiaries)
against and agrees to hold them harmless from any liability for (i) Excluded
Taxes, (ii) Taxes arising from or in connection with any breach by Sellers or
Seller Representative of any covenant contained in this Agreement, (iii)
Transfer Taxes to the extent required to be borne by Sellers pursuant to
Section 9.03(f), and (iv) all costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and
expenses), arising out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or
assertion of any such Tax, in each case incurred or suffered by Buyer, any of
its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary (the
sum of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) being referred to as a "Loss"); _provided_
that no Seller shall have any liability for the payment of any Loss (A) to the
extent such Loss is attributable to or resulting from any breach by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates of the covenant set forth in Section 9.09 hereof and
would not have arisen but for such breach, (B) to the extent a specific
reserve or liability for such Loss was reflected in Final Working Capital,
or (C) described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this Section 9.06(a) unless
the aggregate amount of all Losses with respect to the matters described in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this Section 9.06(a) exceeds $50,000, and then
only to the extent of such excess.

(b) Buyer agrees to indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates and hold them
harmless from all liability for (i) Taxes of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries for Post-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) Taxes arising from or in
connection with any breach by Buyer of any covenant contained in this
Agreement, (iii) Transfer Taxes to the extent required to be borne by Buyer
pursuant to Section 9.03(f), and



 

59 (iv) all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses), arising out of
or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any item described
in clauses (i) through (iii); _provided_ that Buyer shall have no liability
for the payment of any item described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of this
Section 9.06(b) unless the aggregate amount of all liabilities with respect to
the matters described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of this Section 9.06(b)
exceeds $50,000, and then only to the extent of such excess.

(c) If Sellers indemnification obligations under this Section 9.06 arises in
respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary any
deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance (a "Tax
Benefit") which would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then Buyer
shall promptly pay to the Sellers the amount by which such Tax Benefit
actually reduces the amount of Tax that the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is
required to pay (or increases the amount of a Tax refund actually received by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates).

(d) Any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 9.06 shall be
made not later than 30 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of
written notice from the indemnified party stating that any indemnified amount
has been paid by the indemnified party, any of its Affiliates or, effective
upon the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary. The written notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the calculation and the amount for which indemnity
is sought and the circumstances giving rise to the indemnity claim.

(e) For purposes of this Article 9:

(i) the parties hereto agree to allocate Tax items between Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and Post-Closing Tax Periods that end on and begin after,
respectively, the Closing Date on the basis of a "closing of the books."
Anything in Section 9.03(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the parties
hereto agree that neither Sellers (or any of their respective Affiliates) nor
Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) will make a ratable allocation election under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law; and

(ii) in the case of any Taxes that are imposed with respect to a taxable
period that, with respect to a Company or Subsidiary, includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), (A) Property Taxes of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing 



 

60 Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period; and (B) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if
such taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date and was therefore
subject to Section 9.06(e)(i),  _provided_ , that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited
to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing
Date in proportion to the number of days in each period. Each Company and each
Subsidiary that is classified as a partnership or "flowthrough" entity for Tax
purposes shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as if its taxable
year ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and Taxes
attributable to the income and gain of each such entity through the close of
business on the Closing Date shall be considered to be attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(f) _Survival of Tax Indemnity_. The Tax indemnity contained in this Section
9.06 shall survive the Closing for a period of seven years. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, any indemnity claim under this Article 9 shall survive
the time at which it would otherwise terminate if notice of a Tax Claim that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to such indemnity claim is given
prior to such time.

Section 9.07. _Purchase Price Adjustment._ Except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a Final Determination, any amount paid by
Sellers or Buyer under Article 9 or Article 12 will be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 9.08. _Purchase Price Allocation._ To the extent Buyer and Sellers
agree to an allocation of the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.01
(the "Allocation"), Buyer and Sellers agree to allocate the Purchase Price
for all Tax purposes in accordance with the Allocation (except to the extent
otherwise required by a Final Determination) and will provide the other
promptly with any other information reasonably required to complete any
necessary Returns. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
will each notify the other, and will provide the other with reasonably
requested cooperation, in the event of an examination, audit, or other
proceeding regarding any of the allocations set forth in the Allocation.

Section 9.09. _Additional Buyer Tax Covenant_. Buyer covenants that it will
not, and will not cause or permit any Company or Subsidiary or Affiliate of
Buyer, to effect any transaction or take any action on the Closing Date after
the Closing outside the ordinary course of business that would reasonably be

 



 

61 expected to give rise to any Tax liability of any Seller or any Seller Group,
which liability would not have arisen but for such action, it being agreed
and understood that actions contemplated by this Agreement and actions deemed
to occur by reason of any Section 338(g) Election contemplated by Section 9.10
shall not constitute a violation of this Section 9.09.

Section 9.10. _Section 338(g) Elections_. Buyer shall have the right to make,
or to cause its Affiliates to make, timely elections under Section 338(g) of
the Code (a "Section 338(g) Election") only with respect to the purchase and
sale of the shares of each Foreign Company and any Subsidiary of such Foreign
Company other than any Foreign Company or Subsidiary of such Foreign Company
the shares of which are owned, directly or indirectly, by SG Corporation as of
the date hereof.

Section 9.11. _Exclusive Remedies; Limitation to Related Subsidiaries_.
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Tax Claims and
indemnification for any and all Tax matters, including indemnification for
breaches of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 9.02, and the
procedures with respect thereto shall be governed exclusively by this Article
9 and the provisions contained in Article 12 (other than Section 12.01) shall
not apply. References in this Article 9 to Subsidiaries are limited to those
Subsidiaries set forth in Schedule 3.07.

ARTICLE 10

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Section 10.01 _. Employee Benefits._ (a) Each employee of the Companies and
Subsidiaries who is an employee thereof as of the Closing (a "Company
Employee") will receive service credit for all periods of employment with any
Company or Subsidiary or any predecessor thereof prior to the Closing for
purposes of vesting, eligibility and (except with respect to any tax-
qualified pension plans) benefit levels under any employee benefit plan in
which such employee participates after the Closing, to the extent that such
service was recognized under any analogous plan of any Company, Subsidiary or
Seller or an Affiliate thereof in effect immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ that no such service credit shall be given for purposes of accrual
of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or if it would result in a
duplication of benefits. 

(b) If, on or after the Closing, any Company Employee becomes covered under
any benefit plan providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits (a "Successor Welfare Plan"), other than the plan in which he or she
participated immediately prior to the Closing (a "Prior Welfare Plan"), Buyer
shall cause any such Successor Welfare Plan to waive any restrictions or



 

62 limitations with respect to any pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were applicable under the corresponding Prior Welfare Plan), and
any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the calendar year in which the Company Employee
becomes covered under any Successor Welfare Plan shall be taken into account
under any such Successor Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and/or his or her covered dependents for that year, to the
extent that such expenses were incurred during a period in which the Company
Employee or covered dependent was covered under a corresponding Prior Welfare
Plan.

(c) Each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions
necessary to vest Company Employees in 100% of their "employer-match" as of
the Closing Date under the Saint-Gobain Corporation 401(k) Plan for Salaried
and Hourly Employees. Buyers qualified 401(k) plan shall accept rollovers or
plan-to-plan transfers of assets (and any then outstanding loans) and Company
Employees who are not represented by labor unions or similar collective
bargaining entities will be permitted to participate in Buyers qualified
401(k) plan in accordance with its terms; _provided_ that each of Buyer and
Seller Representative shall receive reasonably acceptable evidence that 401(k)
Plan of SG Corporation and Buyer, respectively, is qualified under the
applicable provisions of the Code. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, comply with the terms and conditions of all collective bargaining
agreements to which any Company or Subsidiary is a party or is otherwise
bound.

(d) As of the Closing Date, each Company Employee then participating in the
Calmar Pension Plan or the Retirement Accumulation Plan portions of the Saint-
Gobain Corporation Retirement Income Plan (the "U.S. Pension Plan") shall be
treated by Sellers as 100% vested in such Company Employees accrued benefit
thereunder. Sellers shall be responsible for causing the U.S. Pension Plan to
pay any benefits to which such Company Employees are eligible in accordance
with the provisions of the U.S. Pension Plan.

(e) As of the Closing Date, each Seller shall take all actions necessary to
(i) cause SG Corporation to vest all of the Company Employees participating
in the U.S. Pension Plan in 100% of their accrued benefit or account balances
as of the Closing Date; and (ii) to the extent the Company Employees so elect,
to facilitate the roll over of eligible amounts distributed from the U.S.
Pension Plan to an individual retirement account or to a retirement plan
qualified under the Code. If Buyer is the sponsor of a qualified retirement
plan at the time of Closing or at any time after Closing, Buyer shall take
reasonably action necessary to cause its qualified retirement plan to accept
such rollovers in accordance with its terms.



 

63 (f) For at least one year following the Closing, Buyer (i) shall make
available to each Company Employee severance benefits no less favorable than
those made available to each Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing
and (ii) shall be solely responsible for all severance liabilities arising on
or after the Closing Date to or in respect of Company Employees.

(g) After the Closing, Sellers agree to retain the Retiree Healthcare
Liabilities; _provided_ that for purposes of calculating the Retiree
Healthcare Liabilities, an eligible employees age and service shall be deemed
to end on the earlier of (x) three years after the Closing or (y) the
termination of such employees employment with Buyer or an Affiliate thereof.

(h) Sellers agree to retain, and indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates for and
hold each of them harmless from, (i) any Withdrawal Liability incurred with
respect to any Employee Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan to the extent such
Withdrawal Liability is caused by any actions taken by Sellers, Sellers ERISA
Affiliates, any Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing and exceeds
$1.35 million in the aggregate and (ii) any Liability resulting from a breach
of clause (ii) of Section 3.18(e).

(i) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Article 10, after the
Closing, Sellers agree to retain all liabilities and obligations arising
out of or relating to (i) any Controlled Group Liabilities and (ii) Employee
Plans and International Plans, in case of clause (ii), that are not sponsored
or contributed to solely by one or more Companies or Subsidiaries.

(j) Buyer agrees, and agrees to cause its Affiliates, to pay to the Seller
Representative any amounts received by Buyer or its Affiliates in respect
of the car loan made by the Companies and Subsidiaries to Phillip Davies
prior to the Closing in the aggregate amount of $35,000. Such amounts shall be
paid by Buyer or its Affiliates to the Seller Representative promptly
following receipt thereof.

action or proceeding ("Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information
with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall
have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

completely, unconditionally and irrevocably release the Indemnified Party from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or
Environmental Claim, or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim or in the
resolution of such Environmental Claim, as applicable, and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.



 

68 (d) If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim or to control the resolution of any Environmental
Claim, as applicable, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend against such claim and the portion of any such claim as to which the
defense by the Indemnified Party is unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs
and expenses pertaining to such defense) shall be a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder.

(e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim or
Environmental Claim, as applicable, and shall furnish or cause to be furnished
such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

(f) Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law any
loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying
Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification provision of
this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value
of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the
Indemnified Partys reasonable costs of mitigation) within two Business Days
after the benefit is received.

(g) No Indemnified Party shall have a right to assert any claim for Damages
pursuant to this Article 12 for a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in Section 3.19 ( _Environmental Matters_ ), to the extent that
such claim arises out of any investigation of the soil or groundwater or any
disclosure, report, or communication to any Governmental Authority or third
party regarding an environmental matter, or out of the encouragement by
an Indemnified Party of any action by a Governmental Authority or third
party, unless:

(i) Such investigation, action, or encouragement is (A) required by any
Environmental Law, (B) reasonably believed by the Indemnified Party, in the
absence of an indemnity, to be necessary to respond to any Third Party Claim
against the Indemnified Party, (C) required or in accordance with standard
commercial practices in connection with the closure or decommissioning of a
facility where such action would have been undertaken in the ordinary course
of closing or decommissioning such facility in the absence of an indemnity,
or (D)



 

69 required as a result of the discovery of a condition which is identified
during the course of construction, which construction is undertaken in the
ordinary course of operating the site in the same business in which the site
was operating as of the Closing Date; or

(ii) The Indemnified Party investigates, takes action, initiates or encourages
any such action other than as permitted in Section 12.03(g)(i) above, in
which case the liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement for
any Damages relating to Environmental Claims triggered by such investigation,
action, initiation or encouragement shall be limited to 25% of any Damages
incurred by the Indemnified Party, determined after application of any
applicable deductible or threshold payments and subject to all limitations on
maximum liability and any other limitations on liability, each as set forth in
this Agreement.

(h) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to collect any
amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged
to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 12.02.

(i) Sellers shall be entitled to control the defense or prosecution of any
Claim relating to any Specified Liabilities and shall be entitled to control
and appoint lead counsel for such defense or prosecution, each at Sellers
expense. Buyer shall cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, in the
defense or prosecution of any such Claim, and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend and cause its
Affiliates to attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall cooperate, and
cause its Affiliates to cooperate, with Sellers and their counsel in the
investigation, trial, defense and prosecution of any such Claim (including
the filing of any cross-claim, counterclaim or other proceeding deemed
reasonably appropriate by Sellers) and any appeal arising therefrom. Such
cooperation shall include Buyer and its Affiliates giving prompt written
notice to Sellers of any notice, request, pleading or similar matter they
shall receive relating to any such Claim, and making available, without charge
upon reasonable advance notice and during normal office hours, to Sellers
and their counsel such of its and its Affiliates books, records, documents
and other data, and such of its and its Affiliates officers, directors,
employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents and other
representatives as shall be reasonably necessary. Buyer hereby agrees, and
agrees to cause its Affiliates, to retain all such books, records, documents
and other data in accordance with their respective document retention policies
as in effect from time to time. 

(j) The parties acknowledge and recognize that (A) Sellers and, prior to the
Closing, the Companies and Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer and,



 

70 after the Closing, the Companies and Subsidiaries, on the other hand, possess
or may possess in the future documents or other information regarding the
other group relating to the Specified Liabilities that is or may be subject to
the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine or common interest
privilege (collectively, "Privileges"; and such documents and other
information collectively, the "Privileged Information") and (B) in furtherance
of seeking, obtaining or providing legal advice regarding the matters
contemplated by this Section 12.03, the two groups may exchange in confidence
between themselves or their counsel the Privileged Information. Each party
hereto agrees to protect and maintain, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to protect and maintain, any applicable claim to Privilege in
order to protect any Privileged Information from disclosure or use. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties and their respective
Affiliates shall not (i) waive any Privilege with respect to any Privileged
Information, (ii) fail to defend any Privilege with respect to any Privileged
Information, or (iii) fail to take any other actions necessary to preserve any
Privilege with respect to any Privileged Information.

Section 12.04. _Calculation of Damages_. (a) The amount of any Damages payable
under Section 12.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts
recovered or recoverable by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. If the
Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies,
or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection
with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 12.02 for any (i)
Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (x) there is included in
the Closing Balance Sheet a specific liability or reserve relating to such
matter or (y) the Indemnified Party had otherwise been compensated for such
matter pursuant to the Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.04, or (ii)
special, punitive, indirect or consequential Damages (A) unless payable to a
third party and directly attributable to the actions of an Indemnifying Party,
or (B) other than reasonably foreseeable consequential damages in respect of
loss of profits of the Calmar Business or diminution in value of the Calmar
Business.

(c) For purposes of determining the existence and the amount of a Damage
under this Article 12 resulting from a misrepresentation or a breach of any
representation or warranty (other than the representations or warranties in
Sections 3.08, 3.09(a), and 3.23) made in this Agreement (including
for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of such
representation or



 

71 warranty), all references therein to "material," "in all material respects,"
"Material Adverse Effect" and similar qualifications as to materiality shall
be deemed to be deleted therefrom; _provided_ that for this purpose,
"material," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" and
similar qualifications as to materiality shall not include any threshold
expressed as a dollar amount or any qualification that pertains to a list of
items. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 12.04(c) shall not apply in
determining whether a misrepresentation or breach of representation or
warranty has occurred for the purpose of Article 11.

Section 12.05. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 12.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the
underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 12.06. _Exclusivity_. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement and other than for claims based on fraud, effective as of the
Closing, Buyer waives any rights and claims Buyer may have against each Seller
and its Affiliates, whether in law or in equity, relating to any Company or
Subsidiary or the Company Shares or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims for contribution or other
rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law
(whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach
of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other
claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, Article 9 and Section 12.02 will
provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty,
covenant or other agreement (other than those contained in Sections 2.04,
6.02, 7.02, 7.03 and 7.04) or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

ARTICLE 13

TERMINATION

Section 13.01. _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at

(b) by any Seller or by Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated

72 ( _provided_ that the party seeking to exercise such right is not then in
breach in any material respect of any of its obligations under this
Agreement);

(c) by any Seller or by Buyer if any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction shall have issued any order, decree, ruling or judgment
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (A) as violative of any Antitrust Laws or (B)
for any reason other than as contemplated by Section 13.01(c)(A), and in

permitted by Section 13.01, such termination shall be without liability of
any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant

_provided_ that if such termination shall result from the willful (i)
failure of any party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other parties or (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this
Agreement, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred
or suffered by the other parties as a result of such failure. The provisions
of Sections 7.01, and 13.02 and Article 14 shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to Section 13.01.

_provided_ , _further_ that Buyer may assign the right to acquire the Company

this Agreement.

arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New
York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of
action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from
a transaction of business in the State of New York, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,

inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be

execution of this Agreement and shall terminate without any further action by
any party thereto upon the Closing. 



 

76 Section 14.11. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 14.12. _Schedules_. Sellers have set forth information on the
Schedules in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of the
Schedules need not be set forth in (and shall be deemed disclosed for purposes
of) any other section of the Schedules so long as its relevance to such
other section of the Schedules or section of the Agreement is reasonably
apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the Schedules may include certain items and
information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer.
The parties further acknowledge and agree that neither the specification in
any provision of this Agreement nor the inclusion in any Schedule hereto of
any dollar amount or any item or matter is intended to imply or shall be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Sellers that such amount (or higher
or lower amount) or such item or matter (or other items or matters) are or are
not (x) material or rise to the level of any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect standard for purposes of this Agreement or the Schedules, (y) in the
ordinary course of business of any Company or Subsidiary or (z) required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement. No party shall use the fact of
any such specification or inclusion (or lack thereof) in any dispute or
controversy among the parties as to the foregoing matters.



 

77 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
