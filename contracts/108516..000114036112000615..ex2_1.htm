by (i) the Noteholder Portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount (which
amount will be deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (Noteholder), which the Purchaser will cause the Company to
pay to the Escrow Agent, on behalf of the Noteholder, in accordance with
Section 1.4), (ii) the Noteholder Portion of the Working Capital Escrow Amount
(which amount will be deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of

1.5 Adjustment of Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) (i) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to the
Purchaser an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company (the
"Estimated Balance Sheet"), setting forth in a presentation consistent with
the Company's Interim Balance Sheet, as of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the
Closing Date and a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail:

  

  

(1) the Company's good faith estimate of the consolidated working capital
statement of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of 11:59, p.m., Eastern Time
on the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Statement");

  

  

(2) the amount of the Net Working Capital derived from the Estimated Closing
Net Working Capital Statement (the "Estimated Net Working Capital Amount");
and

  

  

(3) the amount by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is less than
or greater than the Net Working Capital Target (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital Deficit" or the "Estimated Net Working Capital Excess," as
applicable).

  

  

An example of the calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount as
if the Closing Date were October 31, 2011 is set forth on Attachment 1.5(a).

  

  

(ii) No later than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, the
Noteholder will prepare or cause to be prepared (with the cooperation of
Company management and employees as described below) and submit to the
Shareholder for approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) a calculation of the Net Working Capital amount in a presentation
consistent with Attachment 1.5(a) for the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Working
Capital Statement") and a statement setting forth the amount of the Net
Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date derived from
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement (the "Proposed Net Working Capital
Amount"), together with an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
(the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the

Sheet. The Shareholder shall have ten (10) days from receipt of the Closing
Net Working Capital Statement, the Proposed Net Working Capital Amount and the
Closing Date Balance Sheet to provide written notice to the Noteholder with
respect to the manner in which any specific items are calculated and the
reasons therefor. The Shareholder and the Noteholder shall cooperate with each
other to finalize the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, the Proposed Net
Working Capital Amount and the Closing Date Balance Sheet and to submit the
same to the Purchaser no later than sixty (60) days following the Closing
Date. The Purchaser and the Company will (X) provide the Shareholder, the
Noteholder and each of their Representatives reasonable access to the books,
records and documents underlying the preparation of the Closing Net Working
Capital Statement, along with, upon reasonable prior notice, reasonable access
to those members of management and employees of the Purchaser and the Company
who are familiar with their contents (including William F. Knese and Robert A.
Kluver), each of whom shall cooperate with the Noteholder and the Shareholder
as reasonably requested; and (Y) cause their internal accountants (and subject
to confidentiality agreements reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and their
independent registered public accountants), their independent registered
public accountants to provide copies of their work papers underlying the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and the
Proposed Net Working Capital Amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) The Noteholder will, promptly upon the request by the Company or the
Purchaser, make available to the Company and the Purchaser and their
Representatives, the books, records, documents and work papers underlying the
preparation of, and the report with respect to, the Closing Net Working
Capital Statement and the report with respect to the Proposed Net Working
Capital Amount, along with reasonable access to those employees and agents of
the Noteholder who are familiar with their contents. In the event the Company
or the Purchaser disputes the correctness of the Proposed Net Working Capital
Amount, the Company or the Purchaser will notify the Shareholder and the
Noteholder in writing of its objections within thirty (30) days after receipt
of the Shareholder and Noteholder's calculation of the Proposed Net Working
Capital Amount and will set forth, in writing and in reasonable detail, each
of the reasons for such objections (the "Notice of Objection"); provided, that
the reasons for such objection shall include only (X) non-compliance with or a
deviation from the standards set forth in Section 1.5(b) for the preparation
of the Closing Data and (Y) mathematical errors in the computation of the
Proposed Net Working Capital Amount. To the extent not set forth in the Notice
of Objection to the calculation of the Proposed Net Working Capital Amount,
the Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with the Shareholder and
Noteholder's calculation of all other amounts and items contained in the
Proposed Net Working Capital Amount, and neither Party may thereafter dispute
any item or amount not set forth in such Notice of Objection. If the Purchaser
or the Company fails to deliver such Notice of Objection within such time, the
Purchaser and the Company shall be deemed to have accepted the Proposed Net
Working Capital Amount. The Purchaser, the Shareholder and the Noteholder
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed matters within twenty
(20) days after the Shareholder's and the Noteholder's receipt of the
Purchaser's Notice of Objection. If the Purchaser, the Shareholder and the
Noteholder are unable to resolve the disputed matters, the Purchaser, the
Shareholder and the Noteholder will select a mutually agreeable nationally or
regionally recognized accounting firm (other than McGladrey and Pullen, LLP or
KPMG LLP or any other accounting firm with which any of the Parties has a
material relationship) (the "Independent Accountants") to resolve the matters
in dispute (in a manner consistent with Section 1.5(b) and with any matters
not in dispute), including the appropriate amount of interest or earnings, if
any, due on the disputed amounts (determined in accordance with Section 1.5(c)
or Section 1.5(d), as the case may be) and the determination of the
Independent Accountants in respect of the correctness of each matter remaining
in dispute shall be conclusive and binding on the Purchaser, the Company, the
Shareholder and the Noteholder; provided, that the Independent Accountants may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest absolute value for
such item claimed by either the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Shareholder
and the Noteholder, on the other hand, or less than the smallest absolute
value for such item claimed by either the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the
Shareholder and the Noteholder, on the other hand. The costs and expenses of
the Independent Accountants shall be allocated between the Parties based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by
the Independent Accountants. Each Party shall execute a reasonably acceptable
engagement letter, if requested to do so by the Independent Accountants. The
Closing Net Working Capital Amount of the Company as of the Closing Date, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.5(a) (whether by failure of the
Purchaser to deliver a Notice of Objection, by agreement of the Purchaser, the
Shareholder and the Noteholder, or by determination of the Independent
Accountants selected as set forth above), is referred to herein as the "Final
Net Working Capital Amount."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Proposed Net Working Capital Amount
and the Final Net Working Capital Amount (the "Closing Data") shall be
determined in accordance with (i) GAAP consistently applied in accordance with
past practice, the Annual Financial Statements, the notes to the Annual
Financial Statements and (ii) the accounting principles, policies, practices
and methods set forth on Attachment 1.5(b) hereto (the "Accounting
Convention") consistently applied in accordance with past practice; provided,
however, that if there is a conflict between GAAP, the Annual Financial
Statements, and the notes to the Annual Financial Statements, on the one hand,
and the Accounting Convention, on the other hand, the Accounting Convention
shall take precedence. In no event shall the resolution of any dispute
regarding the Closing Data result in the Closing Data not being prepared on a
basis consistent with the Accounting Convention.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(c) (i) For the avoidance of doubt, any federal Tax liability imposed on the
Company or its Subsidiaries by Code Section 1374 attributable to making the
Section 338(h)(10) Election and any corresponding state or local Tax liability
imposed as a result of built in gains recognized in connection with the deemed
sale of the Company's assets as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election
shall be taken into account in determining and shall be reflected as a Tax
liability in the Closing Data. Any Tax liability so accrued shall reflect
appropriate state tax deductions attributable to the payment or accrual of
such Taxes up through the Closing Date as well as any other appropriate
deductions or offsets against such entity level Company or Subsidiary Tax
liability, including all deductions related to payments to the Phantom Unit
Holders pursuant to Section 1.3(c), the payment of bonuses pursuant to Section
9.1 of this Agreement, and all other items of compensation for services paid
at or prior to Closing as required by this Agreement.

  

  

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax liability imposed on the Company or
its Subsidiaries as a result of the payments described in Section 1.3(c) and
Section 9.1 which is not paid by the Company on or before the Closing Date,
shall be taken into account in determining and shall be reflected as a Tax
liability in the Closing Data.

  

  

(d) Following the process set forth in Section 1.5(a) hereof, if the Final
Purchase Price is greater than the Aggregate Closing Payment (such excess, the
"Purchase Price Excess") then the Purchaser will pay to the Shareholder, the
Shareholder Portion, to the Phantom Unit Holders, the Phantom Unit Holder
Portion, and cause the Company to pay pursuant to the Redemption Note to the
Noteholder, the Noteholder Portion, of the Purchase Price Excess. Any amounts
payable hereunder will be paid no later than five (5) Business Days following
determination of the Final Net Working Capital Amount and will be made in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as shall
be designated in writing by the Shareholder, the Phantom Unit Holder
Representative and the Noteholder, as the case may be, at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the payment date.

  

  

(e) Following the process set forth in Section 1.5(a) hereof, if the Final
Purchase Price is less than the Aggregate Closing Payment (such difference,
the "Purchase Price Deficit"), then the Purchaser, the Shareholder, the
Phantom Unit Holder Representative and the Noteholder, as the case may be,
will instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Working Capital Escrow
Amount, and the Escrow Agent will disburse from the Working Capital Escrow
Amount to the Purchaser, the Shareholder Portion of the Purchase Price
Deficit, the Phantom Unit Holder Portion of the Purchase Price Deficit and the
Noteholder Portion of the Purchase Price Deficit, respectively. In the event
the Purchase Price Deficit exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount, then the
Purchaser, the Shareholder, the Phantom Unit Holder Representative and the
Noteholder, as the case may be, will instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse
from the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and the Escrow Agent will disburse
from the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the Purchaser such excess amounts.
Any amounts payable hereunder will be paid no later than five (5) Business
Days following determination of the Final Net Working Capital Amount and will
be made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
account(s) as shall be designated in writing by the Purchaser at least three
(3) Business Days prior to the payment date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Any payment made to any Party under this Section 1.5 shall not be subject
to or included in the calculations made in respect of Section 13.3(a), Section
13.5(a) or Section 13.6(a) to the extent such payments would be duplicative.

  

  

1.6 Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Contemplated Transactions will
take place at the Columbus, Ohio offices of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease,
LLP on December 29, 2011, or at such other time and place as the Parties to
this Agreement may agree (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be deemed to
occur at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the Closing Date.

License, Third Party License or Real Property Lease, (b) any such termination
of a Contract, Company License, Third Party License or Real Property Lease as
a result thereof or (c) any Action commenced or threatened by or on behalf of

disclose any such information by judicial or administrative process or by
other requirements of Applicable Law, such Person shall promptly notify the
Purchaser in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information
which such Person is advised by its counsel in writing is legally required to
be disclosed, provided that such Person shall exercise its reasonable best
efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.
Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available in this
Agreement, the Parties each acknowledge that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy for any breach of this Section 8.6, and that the Purchaser
will be entitled to specific performance and other equitable relief by way of
injunction in respect of a breach or threatened breach of any of this Section

Agreement. The Purchaser will cause such Pre-Closing Tax Returns to be signed
by an appropriate officer of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may
be.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Straddle Tax Returns. At the direction and control of the Purchaser, the
Company will timely prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for all
periods that include the Closing Date but do not end on the Closing Date
("Straddle Tax Returns"). The Purchaser shall provide each such Straddle Tax
Returns to the Shareholder and the Noteholder not later than sixty (60) days
before the due date for such Tax Returns for the review and comment of the
Shareholder and the Noteholder. In the event the Shareholder or the Noteholder
reasonably disagrees with any aspect of a Straddle Tax Return that relates to
a tax liability for which the Shareholder or the Noteholder would be
responsible under this Section 10.1(b) or Article XIII and provides written
notice of such disagreement to the Purchaser within twenty (20) days after
receipt of such Straddle Tax Return, time being of the essence, the
disagreement will be resolved by the Independent Accountants. Any costs and
expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred pursuant to this Section
10.1(b) shall be borne equally by the Purchaser, on one hand, and the
Shareholder, the Noteholder and the Phantom Unit Holders, on the other hand;
provided that such costs and expenses borne by the Shareholder, the Noteholder
and the Phantom Unit Holders shall be paid in accordance with the Shareholder
Portion, the Noteholder Portion and the Phantom Unit Holder Portion,
respectively, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount (without duplication of
any rights to recovery, payment, or indemnity set forth herein).

  

 

  

10.2 Allocation of Taxes. For all purposes of this Agreement, the portion of
the Taxes imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of a Straddle Period, (i) in the case of
any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (including, without limitation,
real estate Tax and whether such Tax is payable to a Governmental Entity, a
landlord or other third party) other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, sales, gross receipts, wages, capital expenditures or expenses, shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of Taxes based upon or related to income, sales, gross receipts, wages,
capital expenditures or expenses, the portion of the Taxes associated with the
Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of such a Straddle Period will be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Purchaser, the Company and the
Shareholder and Noteholder will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by another Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Article X and any audit, inquiry, examination,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon another Party's request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to the preparation and
filing of Tax Returns and to any such audit, inquiry, examination, litigation
or other proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. The Shareholder and Noteholder, the Company and the
Purchaser agree to retain all Books and Records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations.

  

  

10.4 Certain Tax Proceedings.

  

  

(a) The indemnification procedures set forth in this Section 10.4 shall apply
to any Action by any Governmental Entity related to Taxes.

  

  

(b) In the event that the Shareholder, Noteholder and Phantom Unit Holders
would be liable for the payment of any Taxes under Article XIII if assessed or
imposed, and such Taxes are assessed against or imposed on the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company or the Purchaser by any Governmental Entity, the
Shareholder and Noteholder, in each of their sole and absolute discretion,
will have the right to participate at each of its own expense in, but not
control (except to the extent provided in Section 10.4(c) any audit involving
any such Taxes and/or to contest any assertion that any such Taxes are payable
in any proceedings available to the Company, the Subsidiary of the Company or
the Purchaser. The Shareholder and Noteholder, on the one hand, and the
Company and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall fully cooperate in good
faith in connection with any such audit or other proceeding. The Purchaser and
the Company shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement of a material amount for which the Shareholder, Noteholder and
Phantom Unit Holders would be responsible under Article XIII without the prior
written consent of the Shareholder and the Noteholder, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Shareholder and Noteholder will have the right to control all
proceedings in connection with a contest or audit that relates solely to Taxes
for which the Shareholder, Noteholder and Phantom Unit Holders would be liable
under Article XIII; provided, however, that (i) such Taxes do not exceed the
then remaining amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount; (ii) as a
precondition to the Shareholder and Noteholder's right to control such
proceedings, the Shareholder and Noteholder shall conduct the defense actively
and diligently, and (iii) the Shareholder and Noteholder shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the prior
written consent of the Company and/or the Purchaser, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(d) So long as the Shareholder and Noteholder are conducting the defense in
accordance with Section 10.4(c) and subject to Purchaser's rights in Section
10.4(c) the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company and/or the Purchaser may
retain separate co-counsel at their sole cost and expense and may participate
in, but not control, such defense.

  

  

(e) In the event that any of the conditions in Section 10.4(c) is or becomes
unsatisfied, the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company and/or the Purchaser may
control the defense, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement, in any manner that they reasonably may deem appropriate, with
the consent of the Shareholder and the Noteholder, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

10.5 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be
terminated no later than the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder. The Shareholder and the Company will take all actions
necessary to terminate such agreements.

  

  

10.6 Certain Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, and
other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges, and other
similar fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will be paid 50%
by the Purchaser and 50% by the Shareholder, the Noteholder and the Phantom
Unit Holders in accordance with the Shareholder Portion, the Noteholder
Portion and the Phantom Unit Holder Portion, respectively, from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount(without duplication of any rights to recovery,
payment, or indemnity set forth herein), when due, and the Purchaser will file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes, fees, and charges, and, if required by Applicable Law, the Shareholder
will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.
The liability of the Shareholder, Noteholder, and Phantom Unit Holders for
such Taxes will be treated as a Current Liability for purposes of the
calculations in Section 1.5 (to the extent not already paid on or prior to the
Closing Date).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

10.7 Carryovers, Refunds and Related Matters.

  

  

(a) Any refund of Taxes (including any interest thereon) that relates to the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company that is attributable to a Post-Closing
Tax Period will be the property of the Company or such Subsidiary of the
Company, as applicable, and will be retained by the Company or such Subsidiary
of the Company (or promptly paid by the Shareholder, if applicable, to the
Company or such Subsidiary of the Company if any such refund (or interest
thereon) is received by the Shareholder), unless (i) such refund is
attributable to the carry-forward of a Tax item attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or (ii) such refund is in respect of a Tax liability the economic
burden of which was effectively borne by the Shareholder, the Noteholder or
the Phantom Unit Holders through the indemnification provisions in Article
XIII will promptly be paid over to the Shareholder, the Noteholder and the
Phantom Unit Holders in accordance with the Shareholder Portion, the
Noteholder Portion, and the Phantom Unit Holder Portion, respectively, and, in
the case of the Phantom Unit Holders, as directed by the Phantom Unit Holder
Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, a refund of Taxes will include
not only refunds in respect of which a payment is received, but also refunds
effectively received through an offset, credit or other mechanism.

  

  

(b) If after the Closing Date, the Company or any of its Affiliates receives a
refund of any Tax that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, then the
Purchaser will cause the Company or the Affiliate of the Company, as the case
may be, to promptly pay to the Shareholder, the Noteholder, and the Phantom
Unit Holders in accordance with the Shareholder Portion, the Noteholder
Portion, and the Phantom Unit Holder Portion, respectively, the amount of such
refund together with any interest thereon, and, in the case of the Phantom
Unit Holders, as directed by the Phantom Unit Holder Representative, unless
such refund is attributable to the carryback of a Tax item attributable to a
Post-Closing Tax Period.

  

  

(c) In applying Section 10.7(a) and Section 10.7(b) hereof, any refund of
Taxes (including any interest thereon) for a Straddle Period will be allocated
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in
accordance with the principles of this Section 10.7.

  

  

(d) Amended Tax Returns with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the
Company may not be filed without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
and the Noteholder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

  

  

10.8 Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  

  

(a) The Shareholder and the Company expressly elect that Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code shall apply to the Acquisition. The Company and the Shareholder shall
join with the Purchaser in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the
Code and any similar election under any applicable state, local or foreign
income Tax law (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect
to the Acquisition. The Shareholder shall include any income, gain, loss,
deduction or other tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election on
its respective Tax Returns to the extent required by Applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) To facilitate the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the Purchaser shall deliver
to the Shareholder, prior to the Closing Date, drafts of Internal Revenue
Service Form 8023 and any similar forms under applicable state, local and
foreign income Tax law (collectively, the "Section 338 Forms"). The
Shareholder shall review the Section 338 Forms and provide any proposed
revisions to the Purchaser prior to the Closing. The Section 338 Forms shall
be duly executed by the Shareholder and the Purchaser at the Closing. The
Purchaser shall duly and timely file the Section 338 Forms as prescribed by
U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or the corresponding
provisions of applicable state, local or foreign income Tax law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Shareholder agrees that it will execute any
applicable form under state, local or foreign income Tax law which form is (i)
similar to Internal Revenue Service Form 8023, (ii) properly completed by the
Purchaser, and (iii) provided to the Shareholder by the Purchaser after the
Closing Date, but prior to the date that such form is required to be filed
under Applicable Law.

  

  

(c) The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Shareholder, the Note holder and
the Phantom Unit Holders Representative, on the other hand, agree that the
Purchase Price (as increased by the liabilities of the Company and other
relevant items that are deemed sales consideration for federal income tax
purposes pursuant to Code Section 338) (the "Adjusted Purchase Price") will be
allocated to the assets of the Company for all purposes (including Tax and
financial accounting) in a manner consistent with Code Section 338. The
Purchaser shall propose an initial allocation of the Adjusted Purchase Price
among the assets of the Company (the "Asset Allocation"). The Purchaser shall
deliver the proposed Asset Allocation to the Shareholder and the Noteholder
within 60 days after the Closing Date for their review, comment, and consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Purchaser,
the Shareholder and the Noteholder shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any
disputed matters as to the Asset Allocation within twenty (20) days after the
Purchaser's receipt of the Shareholder's or Noteholder's notice of objection.
If the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Shareholder and the Noteholder on
the other hand, are unable to resolve such disputed matters, the each party
may prepare all books, records, and filings in a manner using any reasonable
asset allocation that they deem appropriate even if inconsistent with the
proposed Asset Allocation. The Purchaser, the Company and the Shareholder
shall file all Tax Returns and information reports in a manner consistent with
the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the final Asset Allocation but only in the
event the Asset Allocation is ultimately accepted by the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Shareholder and the Noteholder on the other hand in accordance
with this Section 10.8(c). Any subsequent adjustments to the Adjusted Purchase
Price shall be reflected in amendments to the Asset Allocation made by the
Purchaser in accordance with the principles set forth in U.S. Treasury
Regulations under Code Section 338. Any liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for state, local and federal Taxes resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election (including, without limitation, any Tax liability under
Code Section 1374 and any corresponding provision of State or local law) shall
be borne by the Shareholder, the Noteholder and the Phantom Unit Holders in
accordance with the Shareholder Portion, Noteholder Portion and Phantom Unit
Holder Portion, respectively, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount (without
duplication of any rights to recovery, payment, or indemnity set forth
herein), except to the extent that such Tax liability does not exceed the
amount reserved for such Tax liability on the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement (other than reserves for deferred Taxes to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) and included in the computation of
the Final Net Working Capital Amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If any of the Shareholder, the Noteholder or the Phantom Unit Holder
Representative breaches any covenant or representation set forth in this
Agreement which breach prevents a valid Section 338(h)(10) Election from being
made, the Shareholder, the Noteholder, and the Phantom Unit Holders, shall
indemnify and hold the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company
and their respective Affiliates harmless against any and all Taxes due from
the Company and its Subsidiaries which result from such breach, together with
all expenses and other Liabilities and Damages related thereto. Such
indemnification obligations shall be satisfied in accordance with the
provisions of Article XIII as an indemnification resulting from a breach of a
covenant by the Company. Any such indemnification obligation shall be borne by
the Shareholder, the Noteholder, and the Phantom Unit Holders solely in
accordance with the Shareholder Portion, Noteholder Portion, and Phantom Unit
Holder Portion, respectively, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount (without
duplication of any rights to recovery, payment, or indemnity set forth
herein). Solely for purposes of this Section 10.8(d), the term "Taxes" shall
mean the present value as of the Closing Date of the step up in the adjusted
basis of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that would have
resulted from a valid Section 338(h)(10) Election, computed on the following
assumptions: (i) the Asset Allocation determined pursuant to Section 10.8(c)
hereof (taking into account the Purchaser's transaction costs) is correct;
(ii) each highest marginal rate of Tax applied to income of a corporation as
of the Closing Date pursuant to Applicable Law shall apply; and (iii) the
discount rate shall be 3%. The Shareholder, the Noteholder or the Phantom Unit
Holders, as the case may be, shall pay such Taxes, expenses and other
Liabilities and Damages to the Purchaser after written demand therefor,
together with interest from the Closing Date at a rate equal to the weighted
average prime rate announced from time to time by the Wall Street Journal
during such period but all such amounts described in this sentence shall be
paid only from the Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the
previous sentence. The Purchaser shall deliver with such written demand
evidence of such expenses and other Liabilities and Damages in accordance with
the provisions of Article XIII.

  

  

(e) Any actions, decisions or agreements of the Shareholder pursuant to this
Article X which result in a cost of liability to the Noteholder shall require
the consent of the Noteholder.

  

  

10.9 Tax Treatment. Subject in all respects to the requirement that the
compensations amounts referenced in Section 10.1 be included in the Pre-
Closing Tax Returns as referenced in Section 10.1, the Shareholder and the
Purchaser agree to the following and will take no position inconsistent with
the following on any Tax Return or otherwise: (a) the obligation to make the
payments described in Section 1.3(c)and Section 1.3(e) shall be treated as
liability of the "old target" that are assumed by the "new target" in
accordance with Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the
Code, and (b) all payments made by the purchaser pursuant to Section 1.3(c)
and Section 1.3(e) on the Closing Date shall be treated as cash contributions
to the Company by the Purchaser, and payments made by the Company, in each
case occurring after the "qualified stock purchase," and therefore shall be
treated as occurring the day following the Closing Date for federal income tax
purposes, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-1(d).

TERMINATION

  

  

12.1 Termination.

  

  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing (the
"Termination Date"):

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser, the Company, the Shareholder
and the Noteholder;

  

  

(ii) by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or any one of the Shareholder or the
Noteholder, on the other hand, if the Closing does not occur on or before
December 30, 2011; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this clause (ii) shall not be available to any Party whose willful breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been
the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date;

  

  

(iii) by the Purchaser if (A) there has been a breach by the Shareholder, the
Company or the Noteholder of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of
the Company, the Shareholder or the Noteholder will have become untrue, in
either case without giving effect to any Disclosure Schedule Supplement and
such that the conditions set forth in Section 11.2 would not be satisfied, and
(B) such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured by December 30,
2011 after written notice of such breach is given to the Shareholder, the
Company and the Noteholder by the Purchaser;

  

  

(iv) by the Shareholder, the Company or the Noteholder if (A) there has been a
breach by the Purchaser of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser will have become untrue and such that the conditions set forth in
Section 11.3 would not be satisfied, and (B) such breach is not curable, or,
if curable, is not cured by December 30, 2011 after written notice of such
breach is given to the Purchaser by the Shareholder, the Company and the
Noteholder; or

  

  

(v) by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or any one of the Shareholder or the
Noteholder, on the other hand, if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an
Order or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Contemplated Transactions,
which Order or other action is final and non-appealable.

  

  

(b) The Party or Parties desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 12.1(a) will give written notice of
such termination to the other Party or Parties hereto.

  

  

12.2 Specific Performance and Other Remedies. The Shareholder, the Company,
the Noteholder and the Purchaser each acknowledge that the rights of each
Party to consummate the Contemplated Transactions are special, unique and of
extraordinary character and that, in the event that any Party violates or
fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it in this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party may be without an adequate remedy at law.
The Shareholder, the Company, the Noteholder and the Purchaser agree,
therefore, that in the event that any Party willfully violates or fails or
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such Party in this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party may, subject to the terms of this Agreement
and in addition to any remedies at law for damages or other relief, institute
and prosecute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
specific performance of such covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable
relief.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Article XII, this Agreement will forthwith become void and
there will be no liability on the part of any Party or its respective
officers, directors or stockholders, except as provided in the following
sentence and except for obligations under Section 7.1 Confidentiality, Section
8.5 Public Announcements, Section 14.6 Controlling Law; Amendment, Section
14.7 Consent to Jurisdiction, Section 14.10 Waiver, Section 14.11 Integration,
Section 14.12 Transaction Costs, Section 14.13 Third Party Beneficiary,
Section 14.15 Attorneys' Fees, and this Section, all of which will survive the
Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement will relieve any Party from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE XIII

13.1 Survival. Each of the representations and warranties of the Parties
contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement
will survive the Closing for a period of twenty-two (22) months, except for

made pursuant to this Section 13.1 and, if applicable, Section 13.8(a), then

contained in this Agreement which by their terms do not contemplate
performance after the Closing shall terminate as of the Closing. The covenants

applicable, Section 13.8(a), then the claim shall survive until finally
resolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenants contained in Section

extent of the Phantom Unit Holder Portion of the Indemnification Escrow

13.8 Indemnification Procedure.

  

  

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, on the one hand,
or a Shareholder Indemnified Party, a Noteholder Indemnified Party, a Phantom
Unit Holder Indemnified Party or a Company Indemnified Party, on the other
hand, as the case may be (hereinafter in each case collectively referred to as
an "Indemnified Party") of notice by a third party (including any Governmental
Entity) of any Action or the commencement of any Action with respect to which
such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other Party
for any Purchaser Losses, Shareholder Losses, Noteholder Losses or Company
Losses (as the case may be), such Indemnified Party will notify the Purchaser
on the one hand, or the Shareholder, the Noteholder, or the Phantom Unit
Holder Representative on the other hand, as the case may be (the "Indemnifying
Party"); provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under this Agreement
with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent that, such failure
to notify the Indemnifying Party results in a loss by the Indemnifying Party
of rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with
respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon
written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days after
receiving the notice from the Indemnified Party described above, to assume the
defense of such Action, including the employment of counsel (provided such
counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) and the payment
of the fees and disbursements of such counsel. In the event, however, that the
Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the Action on
the terms provided above or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, in either case within such ten (10) day period, then such
Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such
Action, provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may at any time
thereafter assume the defense of such Action, in which event the Indemnifying
Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnified
Party's counsel incurred prior to the assumption of the Indemnifying Party of
the defense of such Action. In any Action with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not defending such Action, will have the
right to participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such
Party's own expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the
case may be, will at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the
status of the defense of any matter the defense of which they are maintaining
and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of
any such matter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such claim. An
Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim.

  

  

(c) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to
this Agreement, such Indemnified Party will send written notice of such claim
to the appropriate Indemnifying Party with a copy of such notice to the Escrow
Agent. Such notice will specify the basis for such claim. As promptly as
possible after the Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified
Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party will establish the merits and
amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or
otherwise) and, within ten (10) Business Days of the final determination of
the merits and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party will pay to the
Indemnified Party immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim
as determined hereunder; provided, that in the event the Indemnifying Party is
the Shareholder, the Noteholder or the Phantom Unit Holders, the Shareholder,
the Noteholder or the Phantom Unit Holder Representative, as the case may be,
will provide written notice to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreements instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse, and the Escrow
Agent will disburse, from the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the Indemnified
Party immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as
determined hereunder.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Shareholder
shall have sole and exclusive authority with respect to the rights and
obligations of the Indemnifying Party with respect to the Shareholder Portion
of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount
under the Escrow Agreement (Shareholder), and the Noteholder shall have sole
and exclusive authority with respect to the rights and obligations of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to the Noteholder Portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount under the
Escrow Agreement (Noteholder). The Phantom Unit Portion of the Indemnification
Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount under the Escrow Agreement
(Phantom Unit Holder) will be distributed in the same manner and at the same
time as the Noteholder Portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the
Working Capital Escrow Amount under the Escrow Agreement (Noteholder), except
in the case of Purchaser Losses which are the subject of Section 13.3(c), in
which case no distribution will be made from the Phantom Unit Portion of the
Escrow Amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) If a Purchaser Indemnified Party makes a claim against the Shareholder,
the Noteholder or the Phantom Unit Holders under Section 13.3(a), Section
13.5(a) or Section 13.6(a), respectively, for breach of representations and
warranties in Article IV, and the Purchaser Indemnified Party resolves,
settles or otherwise compromises such claim with one such party but not all,
Purchaser agrees to provide written notice of such resolution, settlement or
compromise to the other parties with ten (10) days of such resolution,
settlement or compromise.

  

  

(f) The indemnification procedures set forth in this Section 13.8(a) and
Section 13.8(b) shall not apply to any Action by any Governmental Entity
related to Taxes, which are addressed in Section 10.4.

  

  

13.9 Limitations.

  

  

(a) The Shareholder, the Noteholder and the Phantom Unit Holders shall only
have liability to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or any other Person
hereunder, and the Purchaser shall only have liability to the Shareholder
Indemnified Parties, the Noteholder Indemnified Parties and the Company
Indemnified Parties, and any other Person hereunder, if the claim for which
indemnification is sought was the subject of a written notice given by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 13.8 within the applicable period
following the Closing Date specified in Section 13.1.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and except for
Purchaser Losses arising out of a claim for (i) fraud, or (ii) a breach of a
Fundamental Representation by the Shareholder, the Noteholder or the Company,
the Shareholder, the Noteholder and the Phantom Unit Holders shall have no
liability to any Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent the
aggregate amount of Purchaser Losses payable by the Shareholder, the
Noteholder or the Phantom Unit Holders, as the case may be, hereunder exceeds
the then-current amount of the funds held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
(Shareholder), the Escrow Agreement (Noteholder) and the Escrow Agreement
(Phantom Unit Holder), respectively, and any liability under this Agreement to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be satisfied solely from such amounts.

  

  

(c) Purchaser Losses arising under Section 13.2(a) out of or to the extent
related to a breach of a Fundamental Representation by the Shareholder shall
be subject to the Shareholder Cap. Purchaser Losses arising under Section
13.4(a) out of or to the extent related to a breach of a Fundamental
Representation by the Noteholder shall be subject to the Noteholder Cap.

  

  

(d) The remedies provided in this Article XIII, Section 8.6 and Section 12.2
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties hereto from and after
the Closing in connection with any claim or action arising out of this
Agreement other than claims for fraud or a breach of Section 8.1 (Further
Actions).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except with respect to a
breach of a Fundamental Representation or a representation or warranty in
Section 4.7 or fraud, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall assert any claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 13.3(a), Section 13.5(a) or Section
13.6(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of Purchaser Losses that would
otherwise be payable pursuant to this Article XIII with respect to all such
claims exceeds $1,500,000, and then only to the extent of such excess, subject
to the other limitations set forth in Section 13.9.

  

  

(f) In no event shall any Party have any liability to any Person for lost
profits, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages arising out of or in any
manner relating to this Agreement in the absence of fraud, provided, however,
that such limitation shall not be construed to limit an Indemnified Party's
ability to recover under this Agreement any Losses resulting from a claim
pursuant to which a third party has been awarded lost profits, consequential,
exemplary or punitive damages or any losses resulting from the fraud of a
Party.

  

  

(g) The amount of any Losses payable under this Article XIII by any
Indemnifying Party shall be net of any amounts recovered by the Indemnified
Party (i) under applicable insurance policies after taking into account all
deductibles paid in connection therewith and any increase or expected increase
in premiums that result from making any claim for insurance or (ii) from any
other Person alleged to be responsible therefor. The amount of any Losses
payable under this Article XIII by any Indemnifying Party shall be also be net
of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such indemnified Loss. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, the Tax benefit actually realized by an Indemnified Party
shall mean, with respect to a taxable year of the Indemnified Party and
without duplication, the excess, if any, of (i) such Indemnified Party's
cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year,
calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the indemnified Loss for
all taxable years, over (ii) such Indemnified Party's actual cumulative
liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking
into account any Tax items attributable to the indemnified Loss for all
taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such
Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year), such Indemnified
Party's calculation (which calculation shall be made in good faith and shall
be accompanied by a reasonably detailed explanation delivered to the
Indemnifying Party and such other information as it reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party) being binding on all parties hereto without any other
party's review of any books, records or Tax Returns of such Indemnified Party.
If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies (after taking into account all deductibles paid in connection
therewith and any increase in premiums that result from making any claim for
insurance), or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses,
subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the
Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to this Article XIII and the Indemnified
Party could recover (or could have recovered) all or part of such Losses from
a third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim
asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign
such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of
calculating the amount of indemnification Losses or Damages under Article XIII
of this Agreement (but not determining whether a breach has occurred), any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifier contained in the
representations or warranties in Article II, Article III, Article IV and
Article V will be disregarded once the amount of Losses or Damages with
respect to breaches of the specific representation or warranty at issue exceed
$25,000 in the aggregate, except that the foregoing shall not apply for
purposes of calculating the amount of indemnification Losses or Damages under
Article XIII of this Agreement arising out of or resulting from a breach of
Section 4.6(a) (Financial Statements; No Liabilities) or Section 4.12 (Absence
of Certain Changes or Events).

  

  

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Shareholder
Indemnified Parties, Noteholder Indemnified Parties or Company Indemnified
Parties shall assert any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 13.7(a)
unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages that would otherwise be
payable pursuant to this Article XIII with respect to all such claims exceeds
$1,500,000, and then only to the extent of such excess.

  

  

13.10 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. Except as otherwise
required by Applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any indemnification
payment made hereunder as an adjustment to the Per Share Stock Purchase Price.
Without intending to modify any other section of this Article, any
indemnification payments to be made from the Shareholder Portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount are intended as a post-closing adjustment to the
Per Share Stock Purchase Price reflecting circumstances as may have existed as
of the Closing Date and not as a contingent payment with respect to any events
that may or may not take place after the Closing Date.

the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty will not be construed as a waiver of any other
