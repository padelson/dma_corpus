THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made as of March 27,

("Purchaser"), Continental Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser ("Merger Sub"), Cheddar's
Restaurant Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and
Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company
solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of
the Equityholders ("Agent").

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving that merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein (the "Merger");

WHEREAS, in the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each share of Capital Stock will be converted into the right to
receive the consideration set forth herein;

determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement with
Purchaser and Merger Sub, (b) approved the execution, delivery, and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (c) resolved, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, in each case in accordance
with the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law");

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Purchaser and Merger Sub have
each (a) determined that it is in the best interests of Purchaser or Merger

accordance with Delaware Law; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants, and agreements in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe certain conditions to the
Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms contained herein and the other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE 1 
THE MERGER

1.1. The Merger. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger"), and Delaware
Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and as an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser.

1.2. Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Closing") shall take place remotely via the exchange of documents
and signatures, on a date and at a time to be agreed upon by Purchaser and the
Company, which date shall be no later than the later of (i) the third (3rd)
business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), (ii) the
thirtieth (30th) day after the date of this Agreement or (iii) the expiration
of the applicable notice period if a notice is delivered to Stockholders who
are parties to the Stockholders' Agreement pursuant to Section 4.12(b), or at
such other location, date and time as Purchaser and the Company shall mutually
agree upon in writing. In connection with the Closing, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to become effective by filing the Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time of such filing becoming
effective being the "Effective Time" and the date on which such Effective Time
occurs being the "Closing Date").

1.3. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4. Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth
on Exhibit B.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in their entirety to read as the Bylaws of Merger Sub
read immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be Cheddar's Restaurant Holding Corp.

1.5. Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors and officers
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, to serve until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



1.6. Conversion of Certain Equity Interests.

(a) Preferred Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted and exchanged in accordance with the Company Charter into
(i) one (1) share of Class A Common and (ii) the right to receive at Closing
the Payout Amount.

(b) Class B Common. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of
Class B Common issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted and exchanged in accordance with the Company Charter into
one (1) share of Class A Common.

1.7. Effect on Equity Interests. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities (in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement):

(a) Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect to the
conversions and exchanges described in Section 1.6 (except as set forth in
Section 1.7(b) and excluding Dissenting Shares), shall be converted and
exchanged into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Per Share
Consideration, without interest.

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock. All shares of Capital Stock that are held
by the Company as treasury stock shall be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Options. The Company shall take all requisite actions and obtain any
required consents so that at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each Option outstanding, both vested and unvested, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and the holder thereof (an "Option
Holder") will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount
in cash (the "Option Merger Consideration"), equal to (i)(A) the Per Share
Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Option, minus (ii) the aggregate exercise price for such Option;
provided, however, that if the exercise price per share of an Option exceeds
the Per Share Consideration, such Option shall be canceled without payment and
the Option Holder thereafter shall have no further rights under or with
respect to such Option.

(d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common
stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
stock certificate, if any, of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such
shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

1.8. Closing Consideration. Subject to Section 1.11 and Section 1.14, the
aggregate consideration payable by Purchaser to the Stockholders and by the
Purchaser to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the Option Holders at the
Closing (the "Closing Consideration") shall



consist of an amount equal to (i) the Estimated Merger Consideration, minus
(ii) the Expense Fund, minus (iii) $7,720,000 (the "Escrow Fund"), which shall
consist of (A) an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the "Adjustment Escrow Fund")
and (B) an amount equal to $5,720,000 (the "Indemnity Escrow Fund"), and be
deposited by Purchaser in escrow pursuant to Section 1.13(b)(vi) to be held by
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Escrow Agent"), pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

1.9. Allocation of Consideration. Concurrently with the delivery of the
Closing Certificate, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser a funds flow
statement (the "Payment Schedule"), setting forth, with respect to each
Equityholder and each other Person to whom any Closing Consideration, Company
Transaction Expense or Closing Indebtedness is payable or due at Closing, and
including the name of each Equityholder and other Person, each Equityholder's
Percentage and the respective amounts payable to each such payee, together
with payment instructions with respect to each such payee.

1.10. Payment Procedures.

(a) Stockholders.

(i) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to each Stockholder who has
surrendered to Purchaser at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing
Date the certificates representing such Stockholder's shares of Capital Stock
(the "Certificates"), together with a duly executed letter of transmittal in
substantially the form set forth on Exhibit C (the "Letter of Transmittal"),
by wire transfer, such Stockholder's portion of the Closing Consideration in
accordance with the Payment Schedule and this Agreement and subject to
required Tax withholdings.

(ii) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer books of the
Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed in blank or to Purchaser or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

(iii) Until properly surrendered or canceled, each Certificate shall be deemed
for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the portion of the
Closing Consideration payable in exchange for shares of Capital Stock held by
such Stockholder in accordance with the Payment Schedule and this Agreement.
No Stockholder shall be entitled to receive any portion of the Closing
Consideration to which such Stockholder would otherwise be entitled until such
Stockholder's respective Certificates (or affidavits of loss with respect
thereto) are properly delivered and surrendered in accordance with this
Agreement.



(iv) In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
and upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in a
form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and, if required by Purchaser, the
posting by such holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Purchaser may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Purchaser or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificates, Purchaser shall
pay as soon as practicable (and in any event within five (5) business days)
after receipt of the foregoing affidavit, together with a duly executed Letter
of Transmittal and, if applicable, the posting of such bond, the amount
payable with respect to such Certificates as set forth on the Payment
Schedule.

(v) After the Closing, with respect to any Stockholder who did not surrender
such Stockholder's Certificates to Purchaser at least two (2) business days
prior to the Closing Date in accordance with Section 1.10(a)(i), all payments
to which such Stockholder who did not receive payment pursuant to Section
1.10(a)(i) is entitled pursuant to this Article 1 shall be retained by
Purchaser, and such payments shall be made by Purchaser to such Stockholder
within two (2) business days after such Stockholder has surrendered such
Stockholder's Certificates, together with a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, to Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.10(a)(i).

(b) Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event
within five (5) business days after Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall
deliver to each Option Holder through the Company's payroll system the Option
Merger Consideration payable to such Option Holder in accordance with the
Payment Schedule and this Agreement, subject to required Tax withholdings. At
the Effective Time, each Option shall be cancelled and deemed for all purposes
only to evidence the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration payable
in exchange for such Option in accordance with Section 1.7(c), the Payment
Schedule and this Agreement.

(c) Retention Bonus Payments. Within five (5) business days after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to each Retention Bonus recipient set
forth on the Payment Schedule through the Company's payroll system the
Retention Bonus payment set forth opposite such person's name on the Payment
Schedule, subject to required Tax withholdings.

(d) Transfers of Ownership. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Capital Stock or Options that were outstanding prior to the
Effective Time on the records of the Company or the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

(e) Escheat. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent, Agent nor any
Stockholder shall be liable to any Person for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(f) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Capital Stock (other than any such shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.7



(b)) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
Stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of Delaware Law, if such Section provides for appraisal
rights for such shares in the Merger (any of such shares, "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive a portion of the Closing Consideration unless and until such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to
appraisal and payment under Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, any
such Stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his, her or its right
to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion
of the Closing Consideration to which such Stockholder is entitled, without
interest. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall give Purchaser (a)
reasonably prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of Capital Stock pursuant to Delaware Law and (b) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that there are any
Dissenting Shares, then (i) any payment by Purchaser pursuant to this Article
1 that would have been required to have been paid to the holder of such
Dissenting Shares (assuming, for this purpose, that such holder had not
exercised appraisal rights) shall be retained by Purchaser and (ii) such
holder shall not be considered an Equityholder for purposes of any
distribution of any portion of the Merger Consideration, the Adjustment Escrow
Fund or the Indemnity Escrow Fund, in each case until the final determination
or abandonment of the claim for appraisal.

(g) Interest. Any interest that accrues in the Escrow Fund shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, no other interest shall be payable hereunder with respect
to the Merger Consideration.

1.11. Cash, Debt and Working Capital Estimates. At least three (3) business
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall estimate in good faith the
amount of the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and
Company Transaction Expenses, respectively, and shall deliver to Purchaser a
certificate in writing (the "Closing Certificate") setting forth such
estimates, together with a calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration
and a copy of the Payment Schedule. The Closing Certificate shall be
accompanied by executed payoff letters for each holder of Closing
Indebtedness, other than Capital Leases (the "Payoff Letters"). During the
period beginning with the delivery of the Closing Certificate to Purchaser and
ending three (3) business days following such delivery (the "Pre-Closing
Review Period"), the Company shall make available to Purchaser any statements,
supporting schedules, analyses and other underlying records or documentation
as are reasonably requested by Purchaser to review the calculation of the
amounts reflected in the Closing Certificate. If Purchaser disputes any
amounts reflected on the Closing Certificate during the Pre-Certificate Review
Period, then Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such dispute prior to Closing, after which the Company
shall re-deliver to Purchaser the Closing Certificate with such adjustments as
the parties have agreed are appropriate (which delivery shall not have the
effect of delaying the Closing beyond the Pre-Closing Review Period). If they
cannot agree within the Pre-Closing Review Period, then Purchaser



will accept the position of the Company set forth in the most recent Closing
Certificate delivered by the Company to Purchaser, without waiving rights to
challenge such position pursuant to Section 1.12 or to seek indemnification
pursuant to Section 5.2(c) or Section 5.2(d), as applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, under no circumstance will the dispute resolution process
described in this Section 1.11 cause any delay or otherwise have any impact on
the timing of Closing, regardless of whether any or all of the process
described in this paragraph shall have taken place or been concluded, or any
disputes have been resolved, prior to the end of the Pre-Closing Review
Period. As used herein, "Estimated Closing Cash," "Estimated Closing
Indebtedness," "Estimated Closing Working Capital" and "Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses" mean the estimates of the Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital and Company Transaction Expenses,
respectively, set forth in the Closing Certificate, "Estimated Merger
Consideration" means an amount equal to the Merger Consideration calculated as
set forth herein, assuming for purposes of such calculation that the Closing
Cash is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, that the Closing Indebtedness is
equal to the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, that the Closing Working Capital
is equal to the Estimated Closing Working Capital and that the Company
Transaction Expenses are equal to the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses.

1.12. Post-Closing Adjustments.

(a) Adjustment Statement. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, prepare and
deliver to Agent a statement of the Company, setting forth the amount of the
Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital and the
Company Transaction Expenses, respectively, and, based on such calculation of
the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital and
the Company Transaction Expenses, Purchaser's written calculation of the
Merger Consideration, and the adjustment necessary to reconcile the Estimated
Merger Consideration to the Merger Consideration (the "Preliminary Adjustment
Statement"). Following the delivery of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement to
Agent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall afford Agent the
opportunity to examine the statements and such supporting schedules, analyses
and other underlying records or documentation as are reasonably requested by
Agent. Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with
Agent in such examination. If within thirty (30) days following delivery of
such Preliminary Adjustment Statement to Agent, Agent has not delivered to
Purchaser a written objection notice setting forth in reasonable detail the
reasons for which Agent does not agree with the calculation of the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement, then the Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be
deemed final and binding on the parties hereto and the Equityholders. If Agent
delivers the objection notice within such period, then Purchaser and Agent
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections. In the event Purchaser
and Agent are unable to agree on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
calculations after good faith negotiations for a period of thirty (30) days
following receipt of the objection notice (the "Resolution Period"), the
remaining disputes will be resolved pursuant to Section 1.12(c).

(b) Adjustment of Merger Consideration. If the Merger Consideration, as
finally determined, is greater than the Estimated Merger Consideration, then
Purchaser shall pay to the Equityholders (in accordance with the payment

hereto and the Equityholders. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be

determination as to the disputed items within thirty (30) days after they are

(ii) each of Purchaser and Agent shall furnish to the Independent Accounting
Firm such workpapers and other documents and information relating to such
objections as the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably request and are

matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the Independent
Accounting Firm, (iii) each of Purchaser and Agent shall assign a value to
each disputed item and the Independent Accounting Firm shall determine each

assigned to it by either party or less than the smallest value for such
disputed item assigned to it by either party, and (iv) the Independent
Accounting Firm shall make its calculation of the disputed items (and of the
Merger Consideration) in accordance with this Agreement and shall set forth
such calculation in reasonable detail in a written notice and deliver such
notice to Purchaser and Agent, and such calculation shall (except in the case
of fraud or manifest error) be binding and conclusive on the parties and
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon
which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereof.
Purchaser and Agent (on behalf of the Equityholders) shall each bear their own
fees and expenses



in connection with any such proceeding; provided, however, that the fees and

Liens, except (i) as reflected in the Financial Statements and (ii) Permitted
Liens. All equipment, machinery, furniture, vehicles and other tangible

each of its Subsidiaries (1) for taxable periods (or portions thereof) through

from the Internal Revenue Service or is the subject of a favorable opinion

Employee Benefit Plan that would be reasonably likely to subject the Company
to any excise Tax, penalty (civil or otherwise) or other liability imposed by
ERISA, the Code or applicable Law. No Employee Benefit Plan fiduciary and no
Employee Benefit Plan has engaged in any transaction in violation of Section
406 of ERISA or any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975(c)(1)
of the Code), which transaction is not exempt under Section 4975(d) of the
Code or Section 408 of ERISA. None of the Company nor, to the Company's
Knowledge, any ERISA Affiliate or any Person appointed or otherwise designated
to act on behalf of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate, has engaged in any
transactions in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan that is reasonably
expected to result in the imposition of a penalty pursuant to Section 502(i)
of ERISA, damages pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a Tax pursuant to
Section 4975(a) of the Code.

Benefit Plan generally available to benefits-eligible Company Employees can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued in accordance with its terms,

Liabilities in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment, termination
or discontinuance).

Fiduciary Correction Program, the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System

obligations under and to comply with any Tax Returns requirements applicable
to the Company and any ERISA Affiliate under applicable Law, including Section
4980H of the Code.

(h) Except for the acceleration and cancellation of all outstanding Options
pursuant to Section 1.7(c) and except as set forth on Schedule 2.13(h),
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with a
termination of employment prior to twelve (12) months after the Closing Date)
will result in (i) any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date of this Agreement; (ii) the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting or result in any funding of compensation or benefits;
(iii) any payment, compensation or benefit becoming due, or increase in the
amount of any payment, compensation or benefit due, to any director, Company
Employee or former employee of the Company; (iv) any new obligation pursuant
to any Employee Benefit Plan; or (v) a breach or violation under, or any
limitation or restriction on the right of the Company to merge, amend or
terminate any Employee Benefit Plan.

deferred compensation plan" or that provides for a deferral of compensation
(in each case, as defined under Section 409A of the Code) has been operated
and administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code, and
no compensation shall be includable in the gross income of any Company
Employee or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate as a result of the operation of Section 409A of the Code
with respect to any applicable arrangements or agreements in effect prior to
the Closing. There are no Contracts or other obligations to "gross-up" or make
additional payment to any Company Employee or director for Taxes or excise
taxes under Section 409A of the Code.

(j) All contributions, distributions and premium payments that are due with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan have been made, and all contributions,
distributions and premium payments with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan
for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due have

(k) Schedule 2.13(k) sets forth, for each "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(e) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder) (i) all payments that are in the nature of compensation and
contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company
for purposes of Section 280G of the Code, (ii) the amount of the "parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the
Code) and (iii) the amount or portion of



such payments that the "disqualified individual" may receive or retain only if
the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) are satisfied. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to make any payments or provide
any benefits that could be "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G(b) of the Code after giving effect to the 280G Stockholder Vote and other
actions described in Section 4.11. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
any obligation to indemnify any "disqualified individual" with respect to any
excise tax liability under Section 4999 of the Code.

ARTICLE 3 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER AND MERGER SUB

Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company
that the following representations are true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date:

3.1. Organization, Good Standing, Qualification and Power. Each of Purchaser
and Merger Sub has been duly organized, is validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as currently
conducted. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub is duly qualified to transact
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction, except where the
failure to so qualify would not be reasonably expected to be a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

3.2. Authorization. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements to which it is or will be
a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
such other Transaction Agreements. Assuming that this Agreement and each other
Transaction Agreement to which the Purchaser and/or Merger Sub is a party are
valid and binding obligations of the Company, this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements to which Purchaser and/or Merger Sub, as applicable, is
or will be a party, when executed and delivered by Purchaser and/or Merger
Sub, as applicable, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
Purchaser and/or Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable in accordance with
their terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, and any other Laws of
general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and
as limited by Laws relating to the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies.



3.3. No Violation. Neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub is subject to or obligated
under its articles of incorporation or certificate of incorporation,
respectively, or its bylaws (or equivalent governing documents), any
applicable Law, or rule or regulation of any Governmental Body, or any
material agreement or instrument, or any license, franchise or Permit, or
subject to any Order, writ, injunction or decree, which if breached or
violated by Purchaser's or Merger Sub's execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement would, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

3.4. Sufficient Funds. Purchaser has and will, at the Effective Time, have
cash and cash equivalents and/or available sources of credit sufficient to
consummate the Merger, including payment in cash of the aggregate Merger
Consideration at the Closing and the payment of all related fees and expenses.
Purchaser is not aware of any facts or circumstances that could reasonably be
expected to result in its inability to draw (without material delay) any funds
that may be necessary to be drawn under an existing credit facility in
existence as of the date hereof in order to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to satisfy all other reasonably anticipated
costs and expenses arising in connection therewith. Purchaser acknowledges
that its obligations under this Agreement are not contingent or conditioned in
any manner on obtaining any financing.

3.5. Governmental Consents and Filings. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.12, Purchaser is not
required to make any declaration to or registration or filing with, or to
obtain any permit, from any Governmental Body in connection with the execution
and delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby to which Purchaser is to be a party or the consummation by
Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i)
the filing of a pre-merger notification and report form by the Company under
the HSR Act, and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period thereunder; and (ii) declarations, registrations, filings, or permits
that, if not obtained, would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

3.6. Litigation. There are no proceedings pending or, to Purchaser's
knowledge, threatened in writing against or affecting Purchaser at law or in
equity, or before or by any Governmental Body, which would, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

3.7. Activities of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
effecting the Merger. Merger Sub has not and will not prior to the Effective
Time engage in any activities other than those contemplated by this Agreement
and has, and will have as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, no
liabilities other than those contemplated by this Agreement.

3.8. Solvency. Neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Company or the Surviving Corporation. Each of Purchaser and
Merger Sub is Solvent as of the date of this Agreement, and each of Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis)
will, after giving effect to the Merger, including the payment of all amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of all
related fees and expenses, be Solvent at



and after the Closing, assuming that (i) the representations and warranties in
Article 2 are true and correct in all material respects, (ii) the Company
performs its covenants and obligations herein and (iii) immediately prior to
the Closing, the Company will be Solvent.

3.9. Brokers' Fees. There are no claims for brokerage commissions, finders'
fees or similar compensation in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement based on any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf
of Purchaser for which the Company or any Equityholder is responsible or could
otherwise have any liability.

3.10. No Other Representations and Warranties; Non-Reliance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and
Merger Sub, acknowledges and agrees that (i) Purchaser has conducted to its
satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial condition,
operations, assets, liabilities, properties and business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; (ii) the express representations and warranties set forth in
Article 2 constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
the Company; (iii) other than those representations and warranties expressly
set forth in Article 2, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf is
making, and Purchaser and Merger Sub disclaim reliance on, any representation
or warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity,
in connection with Purchaser's and Merger Sub's entry into this Agreement or
the Merger.

Company as currently conducted, including by paying any third-party consent
fees related to an assignment or deemed assignment of any of the Company's or
its Subsidiaries' Contracts, but excluding fees associated with transfers of

reasonably cooperate with the Company in attempting to obtain the consents,
approvals and waivers contemplated by this Section 4.2.

to the status of receipt of approvals. Without limitation of the foregoing,

forms under the HSR Act promptly (and in no event more than five (5) business
days) after the date hereof and (ii) each of Purchaser and the Company hereto
agrees to respond promptly to any requests for additional information and
documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act. The Company and Purchaser will
not knowingly take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing

with any such filings that must be made by any of the parties under the HSR

non-actions required from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division

to commence or defend any litigation with respect thereto.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Purchaser or Merger Sub be obligated to propose or agree to accept any
undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restrictions, or take any other action
that, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, could be expected to limit the
right of Purchaser or Merger Sub to own or operate all or any portion of the
Company's or Purchaser's respective businesses or assets. With regard to any
Governmental Body, neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of their
Affiliates shall, without Purchaser's written consent, which may be withheld
in Purchaser's sole discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture
transaction, or discuss or commit to alter their businesses or commercial
practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that
limits Purchaser's freedom of action with respect to, or Purchaser's ability
to retain any of the businesses, product lines or assets of, the Company or
otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement.

and be irrevocable upon delivery to the Company and be in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser (the "Written Consent").

business, subject to applicable Law and to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing

and its representatives (including any insurers and underwriters in respect of
the RandW Insurance Policy) reasonable access upon reasonable notice and during
times mutually convenient to Purchaser and senior management of the Company to
the facilities, properties, employees, books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as from time to time may be reasonably requested in advance.
Any such investigation by Purchaser shall not unreasonably interfere with any
of the businesses or operations of the Company or the Subsidiaries. Purchaser
shall not, prior to the Closing Date, have any contact whatsoever with respect
to the Company or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with any partner, lender, lessor, vendor, customer, supplier,
employee or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except in
consultation with the Company and then only with the express prior approval of
the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. All requests
by Purchaser for access or information shall be submitted or directed
exclusively to an individual or individuals to be designated by the Company.



4.5. New Stores; Sale/Leasebacks.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall have the right to make capital and other expenditures in connection with
the construction or opening of the New Stores in accordance with Schedule

the construction and opening of the New Stores.

(b) The Company has purchased certain land in Mesquite, Texas, and has entered
into a sale and leaseback agreement with respect to a new restaurant located
on such property (such sale and leaseback is referred to as the "Mesquite
Transaction"). The Company has provided Purchaser with copies of all material
Contracts related to the Mesquite Transaction. If the Mesquite Transaction is
not completed before the Closing, the Merger Consideration will be increased
by $2.0 million to reflect the Company's purchase price for such land. If the
Mesquite Transaction is completed before the Closing, the Merger Consideration
will be decreased by $3.885 million.

(c) The Company is constructing a restaurant on Leased Real Property in each
of Lake Worth, Texas, and Harlingen, Texas, and may enter into a sale and
leaseback agreement with the applicable lessor with respect to each such
Facility (such sale and leasebacks are referred to as the "Lake Worth
Transaction" and the "Harlingen Transaction," respectively). The Company shall
keep Purchaser reasonably informed as to the status of the Lake Worth
Transaction and the Harlingen Transaction.

4.6. RandW Insurance Policy. Immediately after the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall bind the RandW Insurance Policy on the terms and conditions set
forth under the Binder Agreements. Effective as of or prior to the Closing,
Purchaser shall enter into the policy agreement with respect to the RandW
Insurance Policy and pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses related to
the RandW Insurance Policy, including the total premium, underwriting costs,
brokerage commissions, and other fees and expenses of such policy.

4.7. Press Releases and Communications. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein or therein shall be issued or made, except as
required by applicable Law or the rules of any national stock exchange,
without the joint approval of Purchaser and the Company; provided, however,
that, prior to Closing, Purchaser and the Company will agree upon the text of
the press release to be issued promptly following the execution of this
Agreement. After the Closing, Purchaser may issue any press release or make
any other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein

who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes
prior to the Closing Date, a director, officer or employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (the "DandO Indemnified Parties") against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the same
extent the Company or its



applicable Subsidiary is required to indemnify and hold harmless such DandO
Indemnified Party pursuant to its organizational documents as in effect as of
the date hereof and pursuant to the indemnification agreements set forth on
Schedule 4.8(a). Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 4.8, upon learning of any such claim, shall notify as
promptly as practicable Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation; provided,
however, that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation except to the extent such failure to
notify materially prejudices such party.

(b) Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each
present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary and agent of the
Company and the Subsidiaries provided for in the Company's or such
Subsidiary's charters or bylaws in effect on the date hereof or in the
indemnification agreements set forth on Schedule 4.8(a) shall continue in full
force and effect following the Closing Date for a period of six (6) years.
Without limiting the general indemnification rights of the DandO Indemnified
Parties under this Section 4.8, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser and
the Surviving Corporation also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former officers and directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing to the extent
provided in any written indemnification agreements between the Company and/or
the Subsidiaries set forth on Schedule 4.8.

directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the Company's and
the Subsidiaries' directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company
that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years
following the Closing Date of not less than the existing coverage and have
other terms not materially less favorable to, the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

(d) The obligations under this Section 4.8 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party to whom this
Section 4.8 applies without the consent of such DandO Indemnified Party (it
being expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this Section
4.8 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 4.8 and shall
be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

(e) In the event Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 4.8.

(f) The DandO Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of the
obligations of Purchaser and Surviving Corporation under this Section 4.8,
with full right to enforce the same.



4.9. Employee Benefits Arrangements.

(a) During the period commencing at Closing and ending on the date which is
twelve (12) months from the Closing (or, if earlier, the date the employee is
not employed by the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary), Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide all employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries (the "Company Employees"), other than Transition
Employees, with compensation (including base salary and incentive bonus
opportunities, but excluding equity and equity-based compensation) and
benefits (including vacation, paid time-off and severance), which, when
considered in the aggregate for each Company Employee, are not less than were
provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser
may provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, such benefits by
Company Employees' continued participation in the Employee Benefit Plans, by
permitting Company Employees to participate in Purchaser's employee benefit
plans or by a combination of Company Employees' continued participation in one
or more Employee Benefit Plans and participation in one or more of Purchaser's
employee benefit plans. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide Transition Employees with compensation and benefits as
required by the TSA Agreement. If and to the extent coverage for Company
Employees or Transition Employees is discontinued under one or more Employee
Benefit Plans and is instead provided under one or more of Purchaser's
employee benefit plans, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, treat and cause the applicable Purchaser employee benefit plan
to treat Company Employees' service with the Company or a Subsidiary and
Transition Employees' service with the Company, a Subsidiary or a Service
Provider, in each case, attributable to any period before the Closing, as
service rendered to Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation for purposes of
determining satisfaction of any minimum waiting periods for participation.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Company Employees' and Transition
Employees' service for any period prior to the Closing shall not be recognized
under Purchaser's employee benefit plans (i) for purposes of any equity or
equity-based compensation plans, (ii) for purposes of any employer-provided
credits or non-elective "contributions" under any nonqualified deferred
compensation plans, (iii) to the extent that the recognition of such service
would result in a duplication of benefits or (iv) to the extent that such
service was not recognized under the terms of the corresponding Employee
Benefit Plan or the corresponding benefit plan of a Service Provider. Without
limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation not to, treat any Company Employee or Transition Employee as a
"new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any health plan of
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation for a pre-existing medical condition.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, make
appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such results.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a guarantee of employment of
any employee or restrict in any way the exercise of discretion by the Company,
any Subsidiary or Purchaser (or any of their respective Affiliates) to employ
or terminate the employment of any employee. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, no provision of this Section 4.9 shall
create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent of such employee or former employee)
in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or otherwise.



4.10. Confidentiality. The parties (other than Agent) shall adhere to the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and Agent shall adhere
to the terms and conditions of its engagement letter with the Company dated
March 26, 2017.

4.11. 280G Covenant. To the extent required to avoid a disallowance of
deduction under Section 280G of the Code, not less than five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall submit to the Stockholders for
approval (in a manner and with a disclosure document reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser) by a vote of such Stockholders as is required pursuant to
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the
"280G Stockholder Vote"), any such payments or other benefits that may,
separately or in the aggregate, cause there to be "parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without regard to
Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the
"280G Payments"), such that, if the 280G Stockholder Vote is received
approving the 280G Payments, such 280G Payments shall not cause there to be
"excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. The 280G Stockholder Vote shall establish the right of
each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder) (a "Disqualified Individual") to the 280G
Payments. Prior to such 280G Stockholder Vote, the Company shall obtain, from
each person whom the Company reasonably believes to be with respect to the
Company a Disqualified Individual and who might otherwise receive or have the
right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section 280G of the
Code, a written, duly executed waiver (a "Section 280G Waiver") pursuant to
which such Disqualified Individual agrees to waive any and all right or
entitlement to such parachute payment, to the extent such payment would cause
any payment not to be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code. Such
Section 280G Waivers shall cease to have any force or effect with respect to
any item covered thereby to the extent the 280G Stockholder Vote for such item
is obtained. In addition, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to the
Stockholders (including to the extent required by Section 280G of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder) of all material facts concerning all
payments to any such Disqualified Individual that, but for the 280G
Stockholder Vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. At least five (5) business days prior to
the 280G Stockholder Vote, Purchaser and its counsel shall be given the right
to review and comment on all documents to be delivered to the Stockholders in
connection with the 280G Stockholder Vote and any required Section 280G
Waivers, and the Company shall reasonably consider for inclusion therein all
comments of Purchaser. Purchaser and its counsel shall be provided copies of
all documents executed by the Stockholders and Disqualified Individuals in
connection with the 280G Stockholder Vote.

4.12. Notice; Drag-Along.

(a) The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the date hereof and in
accordance with Sections 228 and 262 of Delaware Law, prepare and deliver to
any Stockholder not consenting to the Merger a notice (the "Stockholder
Notice") that informs such Stockholder of the adoption of this Agreement and
the availability of appraisal rights and such other information as may be
required under Sections 228 and 262 of Delaware Law. Prior to mailing the
Stockholder Notice, the Company shall (i) provide Purchaser a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment



on the Stockholder Notice and (ii) consider in good faith for inclusion
therein all comments reasonably proposed by Purchaser.

(b) If, within four (4) business days after the execution of this Agreement,
the Written Consent has not been delivered to the Company representing at
least ninety-two percent (92%) of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding,
then promptly thereafter the Company shall cause each of the Electing Sellers
(as such term is defined in the Stockholders' Agreement) to (i) elect to have
Section 2(c) of the Stockholders' Agreement apply to the Merger and (ii)
deliver a notice to Stockholders who are parties to the Stockholders'
Agreement and who did not execute the Written Consent that informs such
Stockholders of their obligations under Section 2(c) of the Stockholders'
Agreement.

4.13. Taxes.

(a) Preparation of Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company or any
Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Straddle Period that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns filed by
Purchaser after the Closing Date will be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practice and custom of the Company to the extent consistent with
applicable Tax Law. Purchaser shall provide Agent with completed drafts of
such Tax Returns for Agent's review and comment at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing thereof, in the case of income Tax Returns,
and, in the case of other Tax Returns, such period of time prior to the filing
as Purchaser shall reasonably determine to be practicable, and shall permit
Agent to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing and shall
make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Agent
sufficiently in advance of the due date for the filing (and in any event not
less than five (5) days prior to such due date) of such Tax Return to provide
Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to consider such revisions.

(b) Allocation of Taxes. In the case of any Taxes relating to a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, gains or receipts, or imposed in connection with the sale or other
transfer or assignment of property, other than Taxes described in Section
4.13(c), be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the entire Straddle Period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income, gains or receipts, or imposed in connection with the sale
or other transfer or assignment of property, other than Taxes described in
Section 4.13(c), be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date.

(c) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property
transfer, stock transfer, recording, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with this Agreement shall, to the extent not reflected in Closing Working
Capital, be paid by the Equityholders from the Indemnity Escrow Fund when due.
The Surviving Corporation shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation required to be filed with respect to all Taxes described
in this Section 4.13(c). If



required by Law, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in
the execution of any such Tax Return and other documentation.

(d) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. With the exception of customary
commercial leases or contracts that are not primarily related to Taxes entered
into the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
liabilities thereunder, all Tax sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or
similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, the Company, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall not
be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

4.14. Termination of Certain Agreements. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall terminate, or cause to be terminated, each Contract set forth on
Schedule 7.2(e) without any further liability or obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

4.15. No Solicitation of Transactions.

(a) During the period beginning on the Company's receipt of the Requisite
Company Vote and ending on the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, and each
will instruct its respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors and other representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it), not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
nonpublic information), or take any other action knowingly to facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or
offer to the Stockholders) that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Competing Transaction, or enter into or maintain or continue any
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Competing
Transaction, or agree to or endorse any Competing Transaction. The Company
shall cease immediately and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to a Competing
Transaction.

(b) The Company will notify Purchaser promptly after receipt by the Company or
any of its Affiliates (or any of its or their officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors or other representatives) of any proposal for, or inquiry
with respect to any Competing Transaction, or any request for information or
for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with any such proposal or inquiry. Such notice to
Purchaser shall indicate in reasonable detail the terms and conditions
thereof.

ARTICLE 5 
INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES

5.1. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing through and until the date that is twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.1 (Organization, Good
Standing, Corporate Power and Qualification), Section 2.2 (Subsidiaries),
Sections 2.3(a) and 2.3



(c) (Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement), Section 2.4
(Capitalization), and Section 2.19 (Brokerage Fees) shall survive the Closing
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (all of such
representations and warranties collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations"). The covenants and agreements of the parties contained in
this Agreement (i) that are performed at or prior to Closing pursuant to
Section 4.1 shall survive the Closing through and until the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and (ii) that are required to be
performed after the Closing shall continue in full force and effect and
survive in accordance with their respective terms and the applicable statute
of limitations. Any such period of survival set forth in this Section 5.1 is
referred to as a "Survival Period." Any claim for indemnification under this
Article 5 shall be made by giving a claim notice pursuant to Section 5.4 on or
before the expiration of the applicable Survival Period; provided, however,
that any claim for indemnification that is the subject of a claim notice
delivered prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period shall
survive until the final resolution of such claim.

5.2. Indemnification by the Equityholders. Subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.5,
each of the Equityholders severally, but not jointly, shall indemnify and hold
Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, members, partners,
agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns (collectively,
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against, and to pay to the
applicable Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the amount of any and all losses,
liabilities, obligations, deficiencies, judgments, damages, interest, fines,
assessments, costs and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation
and defense and reasonable attorneys' fees) (individually, a "Loss" and,
collectively, "Losses") incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Party arising
out of or resulting from:

(a) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the
Company (i) in this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects as of the
date hereof or on the Closing Date or (ii) in the certificates delivered
pursuant to Sections 1.13(a)(i) and (iv) to be true and correct in all
respects as of the Closing Date (in each case, disregarding any qualifications
as to Material Adverse Effect, materiality or phrases of like import contained
in such representations and warranties);

(b) the breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of the Company
under this Agreement;

(c) any Company Transaction Expenses not paid prior to or at the Closing or
pursuant to Section 1.12;

(d) any Indebtedness of the Company existing prior to the Closing and not paid
prior to or at the Closing or pursuant to Section 1.12; or

(e) any failure by the Company to obtain the consent or approval of any Person
that is a party to a Contract and whose consent or approval is required as set
forth on Schedule 2.3(b) prior to the Closing (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Losses that constitute consent fees or similar payments made after
the Closing to obtain any such consents or approvals).



5.3. Indemnification by Purchaser and Merger Sub. Subject to Sections 5.1 and
5.5, Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby agree to indemnify and hold the
Equityholders, their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
stockholders, members, partners, agents, attorneys, representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, "Equityholder Indemnified Parties")
harmless from and against, and to pay to the applicable Equityholder
Indemnified Parties, the amount of any and all Losses arising out of or
resulting from:

(a) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser
or Merger Sub (i) in this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects as
of the date hereof or on the Closing Date or (ii) in the certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 1.13(b)(i) to be true and correct in all respects as of
the Closing Date (in each case, disregarding any qualifications as to
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, materiality or phrases of like import
contained in such representations and warranties); or

(b) the breach of any covenant or other agreement on the part of Purchaser or
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

5.4. Indemnification Procedures.

(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification
is sought, which notice will include a reasonably detailed description of the
indemnification claim and the amount (which may be estimated in good faith)
for which indemnity is sought, provided that with respect to any claim against
the Equityholders generally or any Equityholder specifically, Purchaser shall
provide such notice to Agent, on behalf of the Equityholder(s), which notice
shall be deemed having been provided to such Equityholder(s). If the
indemnifying party (or Agent, on behalf of the Equityholder(s)) shall object
in writing to any claim by an indemnified party made pursuant to this Section
5.4(a) within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of such claim, then the
parties shall attempt in good faith for a period of up to forty-five (45) days
to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to the claim.
If the parties do not reach an agreement by the conclusion of such forty-five
(45) day period, then either party may bring suit to resolve the parties'
respective rights with respect to such claim. If the indemnifying party (or
Agent, on behalf of the Equityholder(s)) does not object in writing to such
claim within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such claim, then such
claim shall be conclusively deemed an obligation of the indemnifying party.

(b) In the event that any action, claim or proceeding shall be instituted or
that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of
which payment may be sought under Section 5.2 or 5.3 (regardless of the
limitations set forth in Section 5.5) (a "Third Party Claim"), the indemnified
party shall give reasonably prompt written notice of the assertion of such
Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by Section 5.2 or
5.3 to the indemnifying party, provided that if the Equityholders are the
indemnifying party, such notice shall be given to Agent. The failure of the
indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim
shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party's
obligations with respect thereto except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party (or
Agent, on behalf of the Equityholders if they are the indemnifying party)
admits in writing to the indemnified party within fifteen (15) business days
after receiving



notice of a Third Party Claim that it is obligated to indemnify such
indemnified party pursuant to this Article 5, the indemnifying party (or
Agent, on behalf of the Equityholders if they are the indemnifying party)
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to solely control the defense
(represented by counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party) and defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with such Third Party Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
5.4(c). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim
as permitted by this Section 5.4(b), the indemnifying party shall keep the
indemnified party reasonably informed as to the status of such claim and
proceedings.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(b), if the Equityholders are the indemnifying
party, then neither the indemnifying party nor Agent on the Equityholders'
behalf will be entitled to control, and the Purchaser Indemnified Party will
be entitled to have sole control over, the defense, compromise or settlement
of any Third Party Claim (and the cost of such defense and any Losses with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall constitute Losses for which the
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder) if (i)
the Third Party Claim involves a criminal proceeding, action, indictment or
investigation, (ii) the Third Party Claim primarily seeks injunctive relief,
specific performance or other equitable relief against any Purchaser
Indemnified Party, (iii) the aggregate amount of the Third Party Claim exceeds
or is reasonably expected to exceed the Indemnity Escrow Fund (or portion
thereof then remaining in the Escrow Account), (iv) the Third Party Claim
involves allegations of any violation of any competition or securities Law or
(v) the Third Party Claim was initiated by or involves a material supplier of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Purchaser or its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding Section 5.4(b), if the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Third Party Claim as permitted herein, the indemnifying party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the applicable indemnified party, enter
into any settlement or consent to entry of any judgment that (A) does not
involve granting by the Person or Persons asserting such claim or demand of an
unconditional release from all liability of the indemnified party with respect
to such claim or demand (and any potential similar or analogous claims), (B)
involves any non-monetary relief or remedy, including any restrictions on any
indemnified party's ability to operate or compete, or (C) involves any
admission of violation of Law or acknowledges the indemnified party's
liability for future acts. The parties hereto agree to cooperate reasonably
with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of
any Third Party Claim.

(d) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (or Agent if
the Equityholders are the indemnifying party) shall have arrived at a mutually
binding agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim or a claim under Section
5.4(a), the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party (or
Agent if the Equityholders are the indemnifying party) notice of any sums due
and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
such matter and the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all of such
sums so due and owing to the indemnified party in accordance with Section 5.6.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, an indemnified party is not required to
commence a proceeding against the indemnifying party to enforce its rights
hereunder prior to the expiration



of the applicable Survival Period if the indemnified party has made a claim
for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.2 or 5.3, as applicable, prior to
such expiration.

5.5. Limitations on Liability.

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification under Section
5.2 shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) Purchaser shall not
have the right to be indemnified pursuant to Section 5.2 (A) unless and until
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have incurred, on a cumulative basis
following the Closing, Losses in excess of $2,860,000 (the "Basket")
(excluding Losses that are not indemnifiable because of the Minimum Claim
Threshold), in which event the right to be indemnified shall apply to all
Losses, inclusive of the amount of the Basket, but subject to the other terms
and limitations herein, or (B) if the incident or matter (together with any
series of or similar or related incidents or matters) or series of related
matters giving rise to the Losses does not result in Losses in excess of
$50,000 (the "Minimum Claim Threshold"); and (ii) the Indemnity Escrow Fund
shall be the exclusive remedy against an Equityholder and the maximum
aggregate amount of Losses for which the Equityholders shall be obligated to
provide indemnity under Section 5.2 shall equal the amount held in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, (x) the limitations set forth in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this Section 5.5(a) shall not be applicable to any Losses
resulting from actual fraud or to a claim for indemnification to the extent
such claim is based on the failure of a Fundamental Representation to be true
and correct and (y) the limitations set forth in clause (i) of this Section
5.5(a) shall not be applicable to any Losses resulting from a claim for
indemnification to the extent such claim is based on (A) any Company
Transaction Expenses outstanding and not paid prior to or at the Closing or
pursuant to Section 1.12, (B) any Indebtedness of the Company existing prior
to the Closing and not paid prior to or at the Closing or pursuant to Section
1.12 or (C) any failure by the Company to obtain the consent or approval of
any Person that is a party to a lease and whose consent or approval is
required as set forth on Schedule 2.3(b) prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that the aggregate indemnification amounts paid to Purchaser
Indemnified Parties by the Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement shall in
no event exceed the aggregate amount of cash proceeds actually received by the
Equityholders in their capacity as Equityholders pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the maximum
aggregate amount of Losses for which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties as a
group may be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement from a specific
Equityholder shall in no event exceed the aggregate amount of cash proceeds
actually received by such Equityholder in his/her/its capacity as an
Equityholder pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser
shall not be entitled to any indemnification under this Agreement (i) to the
extent Purchaser could have, with commercially reasonable efforts, mitigated
or prevented the Loss with respect to such breach or (ii) to the extent
indemnification or insurance remedies (including under the RandW Insurance
Policy, the Existing Purchase Agreement or the Existing RandW Policy) are
available with respect to such breach and have not been fully exhausted.



(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall give rise to
any right on the part of Purchaser, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the amount of
any Losses incurred or suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be
calculated after giving effect to any alternative insurance proceeds or
indemnification (including under the Existing Purchase Agreement and Existing
RandW Policy) actually received by a Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to
such Losses. If a Purchaser Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds
or indemnification proceeds under the Existing Purchase Agreement after an
indemnification payment is made to it by the Equityholders under this Article
5, Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable deliver to the Escrow Agent for
deposit to the Escrow Fund the amount of such proceeds at such time or times
as and to the extent that such proceeds are realized by Purchaser; provided,
however, that if the Escrow Fund no longer exists, Purchaser shall pay such
amount to the Equityholders in proportion to their respective Percentages.
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover insurance
proceeds or any other amounts from third parties (including under the RandW
Insurance Policy, the Existing Purchase Agreement and Existing RandW Policy),
related to any Losses for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this
Article 5; provided that any related Survival Period shall be tolled with
respect to the related claim and amount of Losses during such recovery effort.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that an indemnified party recognizes any Tax Benefit, the amount of any Losses
incurred or suffered with respect to a claim for indemnification shall be
calculated net of any Tax Benefit that the indemnified party actually
realizes, directly or indirectly, as a result of being able to deduct the
Losses for Tax purposes (net of any Tax liability to the indemnified party or
any of its Affiliates attributable to the related indemnification payment). If
an indemnified party receives, directly or indirectly, a Tax Benefit after the
related indemnification payment is made to the indemnified party, the
indemnified party shall promptly pay to the indemnifying party or, if
applicable, deliver to the Escrow Agent for deposit to the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, the amount of such Tax Benefit (net of any Tax liability to the
indemnitee or any of its Affiliates attributable to the related
indemnification payment) at such time or times as and to the extent that such
Tax Benefit is realized by the indemnified party as a result of being able to
currently deduct Losses for Tax purposes; provided, however, that (i) if the
Escrow Fund no longer exists and the indemnified party is Purchaser, Purchaser
shall pay such amount directly to the Equityholders in proportion to their
respective Percentages and (ii) an indemnified party's obligation to deliver
the amount of such Tax Benefit to the indemnifying party shall only apply to
Tax Benefits that the indemnified party actually realizes within two (2) years
following the date of the related indemnification payment. For purposes
hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall mean the amount, if any, by which an indemnified
party's liability for Taxes payable for a taxable year is actually reduced by
way of refund, reduction of or credit against such indemnified party's Tax
liabilities, in each case that results, directly or indirectly, from being
able to deduct the Losses for Tax purposes.



(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except in the
case of a Third Party Claim, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have the
right to be indemnified for any Losses to the extent they are in the nature of
punitive or exemplary damages. Any Loss for which an indemnified party is
entitled to indemnification under this Article 5 shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty or
covenant.

(g) Nothing in this Article 5 shall limit or reduce the rights of any DandO
Indemnified Party (or the obligations of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates) pursuant to Section 4.8 or pursuant to any
arrangements, rights, agreements or insurance referenced therein; provided,
however, that a DandO Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to assert such
rights to avoid, or assert as a defense to, such Person's obligations in its
capacity as an Equityholder (and not as a DandO Indemnified Party) to provide
indemnity in accordance with this Article 5.

(h) Any Losses of a party pursuant to this Article 5 shall be disregarded to
the extent such Losses were specifically accrued as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration in connection with the determination of the Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital or Closing Company Transaction
Expenses.

5.6. Procedures for Claims Against, and Distributions of, Funds Deposited with
Escrow Agent.

(a) Claims. At the time a Purchaser Indemnified Party gives, or at any time
after a Purchaser Indemnified Party gives, Agent written notice of such
Purchaser Indemnified Party's indemnification claim in accordance with Section
5.4, Purchaser may make a written claim against the Indemnity Escrow Fund by
delivering written notice of same (the "Claim Notice") to the Escrow Agent as
more particularly provided in the Escrow Agreement (in which event Purchaser
will provide a copy of such Claim Notice to Agent). Any such Claim Notice will
include a reasonably detailed description of the indemnification claim and the
amount (which may be estimated in good faith) for which indemnity is sought.
The Escrow Agent will distribute the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Final Distribution. On the second (2nd) business day after the date that
is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Agent will deliver
a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to distribute to the
Equityholders, the Indemnity Escrow Fund, less all amounts then subject to any
unresolved indemnity claims, to be distributed based upon each Equityholder's
Percentage. Any amounts retained with respect to any unresolved indemnity
claims shall be retained until the final resolution of such claims, at which
time such amount shall be distributed to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
and/or the Equityholders, as applicable, in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

(c) Order of Payments. To the extent amounts are required to be paid by the
Equityholders to a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Article 5, such amounts shall be first
satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, in accordance with the terms hereof
and of the Escrow Agreement, until the Indemnity Escrow Fund is reduced



to $0.00 (due to the release of such funds pursuant to this Section 5.6 or
otherwise), and thereafter, only in the event of actual fraud or to the extent
related to the failure of a Fundamental Representation to be true and correct,
such amounts shall be payable directly by the Equityholders (subject to
Section 5.5 and the other limitations set forth herein) severally in
proportion to their respective Percentages.

5.7. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Company, the Equityholders,
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation agree to treat any indemnity payment
made pursuant to this Article 5 as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

5.8. Exclusive Remedy; Further Limitations. Except with respect to fraud, the
right to seek specific performance or injunctive relief to enforce a party's
covenants and obligations in any Transaction Agreement or as provided in
Section 4.13(c) and Section 6.2, the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article 5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto
with respect to any and all claims from and after the Closing Date arising out
of the subject matter of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties' rights under the RandW Insurance Policy, the Existing
Purchase Agreement or the Existing RandW Policy.

ARTICLE 6 
AGENT

6.1. Appointment of Agent. Each Equityholder hereby appoints Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact
of the Equityholders with full powers of substitution to act in the name,
place and stead of the Equityholders with respect to the performance on behalf
of the Equityholders under the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, as the same may be from time to time amended,
and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to
execute all such documents on behalf of the Equityholders as Agent deems
necessary or appropriate without inquiry of and without additional approval
from the Equityholders in connection with any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including:

(a) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and to pay such
Equityholders' expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
performance of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements (whether
incurred prior to, on or after the date of this Agreement);

(b) to give and receive all notices, communications and to receive and accept
service of legal process in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
arising under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements;

(c) to authorize, direct or object to delivery to Purchaser of cash from the
Escrow Fund;



(d) to deduct and/or hold back any funds that may be payable to any
Equityholder pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements in order to pay any amount that may be payable by such Equityholder
hereunder, in each case on a basis consistent with their Percentage;

(e) to make any determinations, agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, any matters contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements, including in connection with the determination or the
adjustment of, or any other matter pertaining to, the Merger Consideration,
whether before or after Closing;

(f) to act for the Equityholders with respect to all indemnification matters
referred to in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, including
the right to negotiate and compromise on behalf of the Equityholders any
indemnification claim made by or against the Equityholders;

(g) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Equityholder any amendment or
waiver to the terms of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements;

(h) to disburse funds to third parties for expenses and liabilities;

(i) to engage, employ and obtain the advice of legal counsel, accountants and
other professional advisors and rely on their advice and counsel, and to incur
and pay fees and expenses of such advisors on behalf of the Equityholders;

(j) to take or refrain from taking all actions necessary or appropriate on
behalf of the Equityholders in the sole judgment of Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or required or permitted by the terms of this
Agreement or the Transaction Agreements; and

(k) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such
Equityholder, or any or all of the Equityholders collectively, are permitted
or required to do or exercise under this Agreement.

This grant of authority (including the appointment of agency and this power of
attorney) (i) shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable outside of this
Agreement and shall be binding on the Equityholders, (ii) is coupled with an
interest and will be irrevocable and will not be terminated by any
Equityholder or by operation of Law, whether by the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy, liquidation or incapacity of any Equityholder or the occurrence of
any other event, and any action taken by Agent will be as valid as if such
death, incompetence, bankruptcy, liquidation, incapacity or other event had
not occurred, regardless of whether or not any Equityholder or Agent will have
received any notice thereof and shall be binding on any successor thereto and
(iii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Equityholder of the
whole or fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund. Agent may
resign at any time. A new Agent may be designated by the holders at Closing of
a majority in interest of the Equityholders upon not less than ten (10) days'
prior written notice to Purchaser. No bond shall be required of Agent, and
Agent shall receive no compensation for its services from Purchaser, Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates (except to the extent that any such
Affiliates are Equityholders) after the Closing. After the Closing,



notices or communications to or from Agent shall constitute notice to or from
each of the Equityholders.

6.2. Exculpation and Indemnification; Expense Fund.

(a) Agent will incur no liability of any kind with respect to any action or
omission by Agent in connection with its services pursuant to this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Agent shall not
be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Equityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Agent from and against
any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Agent Losses") arising out
of or in connection with Agent's execution and performance of this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements, in each case as such Agent Loss is suffered or
incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Agent Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Agent, Agent will reimburse the Equityholders the amount of such
indemnified Agent Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to Agent by the Equityholders, any
such Agent Losses may be recovered by Agent from (i) the funds in the Expense
Fund and (ii) the amounts in the Escrow Fund at such time as remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Equityholders; provided, that while
this section allows Agent to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds,
this does not relieve the Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay
such Agent Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent Agent
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event
will Agent be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the Equityholders
or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnity of the Equityholders set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the
indemnities provided to Agent under this section. The foregoing indemnities
will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of Agent or the
termination of this Agreement.

(b) Upon the Closing, the Company will wire to Agent an amount of $200,000
(the "Expense Fund"), which will be used for the purposes of paying directly,
or reimbursing Agent for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements. The Equityholders will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to Agent any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such
interest or earnings. Agent will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Agent will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds,
will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate
purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors
in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of
Agent's responsibilities, Agent shall disburse any remaining balance of the
Expense Fund to the Escrow Agent for further distribution to the
Equityholders. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Equityholders at the time of
Closing. Agent is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity
in connection with the Expense Fund and is not responsible for any Tax
reporting or withholding with respect thereto.



6.3. Acceptance of Appointment.

(a) By his, her or its signature to this Agreement, the initial Agent hereby
accepts the appointment contained in this Agreement, as confirmed and extended
by this Agreement, and agrees to act as Agent and to discharge the duties and
responsibilities of Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Agent has all requisite limited liability company power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by Agent and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each other party hereto,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Agent, enforceable
against Agent in accordance with its terms, subject to the laws of agency.

6.4. Actions of Agent. A decision, act, consent or instruction of Agent shall
constitute a decision of all Equityholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Equityholder, and the Escrow Agent, Purchaser,
Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation may rely upon any decision, act, consent
or instruction of Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each and every such Equityholder. The Escrow Agent, Purchaser, Merger Sub and
Surviving Corporation are hereby irrevocably relieved from any liability to
any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of Agent.

9.7. Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall bear its own fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be responsible for the costs and expenses
of obtaining and maintaining the RandW Insurance Policy (including the payment
of any premiums in respect thereof) and the costs and expenses of the Escrow
Agent.

9.8. Attorney's Fees. If any action at law or in equity is necessary to
enforce or interpret the terms of any of the Transaction Agreements, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable



attorney's fees, costs and necessary disbursements in addition to any other
relief to which such party may be entitled.

9.9. Amendments and Waivers. Any term of this Agreement may be amended or
terminated only with the express written consent of Purchaser and (i) prior to
the Closing, the Company or (ii) following the Closing, Agent. Compliance with
any term or provision of this Agreement with which a party was or is obligated
to comply may only be waived by Purchaser, on its own behalf, and (i) by the
Company prior to the Closing, on its own behalf, or (ii) by following the
Closing, by Agent, on behalf of the Equityholders and on its own behalf. Any
amendment or waiver not effected in accordance with this Section 9.9 shall be
null and void.

9.10. Specific Performance.

(a) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any
party hereto to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including such
party's failure to take all actions as are necessary on such party's part in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement to consummate the
Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages,
even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party
hereto hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by the Relevant
Courts to compel performance of such party's obligations and to the granting
by the Relevant Courts of the remedy of specific performance of such party's
obligations hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company, and following Closing, Agent, shall be entitled to cause Purchaser to
fully perform the terms of this Agreement to the fullest extent permissible
pursuant to this Agreement and applicable Law and to thereafter cause this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions thereto as set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
Order or injunction.

(c) Prior to the Closing, if any action is brought to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Outside Date
shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such
action is pending, plus ten (10) business days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action.

9.11. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order



that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

9.12. Delays or Omissions. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power
or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or
default of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right,
power or remedy of such non-breaching or non-defaulting party nor shall it be
construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence
therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor
shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any
other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver,
permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party
of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of
any party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in
writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in
such writing. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise
afforded to any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative.

9.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (which term shall be deemed to include
the Transaction Agreements and the exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties hereto and supersede all prior agreements, letters of intent and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement.

9.14. Joint Negotiation and Drafting. The parties hereto have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

9.15. Interpretation.

(a) Any capitalized terms used in any schedule or exhibit attached hereto and
not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in this
Agreement.

(b) Whenever required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the
singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the plural and vice
versa.

(c) The terms "hereof," "herein," "hereof," "hereto" and "hereunder" and terms
of similar import are references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement.

(d) Section, clause, schedule and exhibit references contained in this
Agreement are references to sections, clauses, schedules and exhibits in or to
this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.



(e) The terms "includes," "including" and similar terms shall be deemed to
mean "including, without limitation."

(f) The use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive unless expressly indicated
otherwise.

(g) Reference to any Person includes such Person's successors and assigns to
the extent such successors and assigns are permitted by the terms of any
applicable agreement, and reference to a Person in a particular capacity
excludes such Person in any other capacity or individually.

(h) Reference to any agreement (including this Agreement), document or
instrument shall mean such agreement, document or instrument as amended,
modified or supplemented and in effect from time to time in accordance with
the terms thereof and, if applicable, the terms hereof.

(i) References to "days" shall refer to calendar days unless business days are
specified, and "business days" shall mean a day, other than a Saturday or
Sunday, on which commercial banks in New York City are open for the general
transaction of business. If any period expires on a day that is not a business
day or any event or condition is required by the terms of this Agreement to
occur or be fulfilled on a day that is not a business day, such period shall
expire or such event or condition shall occur or be fulfilled, as the case may
be, on the next succeeding business day.

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, any subtraction of a negative number or amount
hereunder shall be equal to the addition of the absolute value of such
negative number or amount.
