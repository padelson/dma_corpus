the Cash Consideration (the " **Contribution Consideration** "), as adjusted
pursuant to this Agreement. The calculation of the percentages of the Equity
Consideration and of the Cash Consideration to be received by each Contributor
are set forth on _Annex A_. Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement,
any adjustment to the Contribution Consideration shall be made pro rata to the
Cash Consideration and to the Equity Consideration and pro rata to each
Contributor in accordance with their entitlement to the Cash Consideration or
Equity Consideration, as applicable. The Adjusted Equity Consideration (less

Holdback Cash) shall be paid by the Partnership to Contributors at the Closing
as set forth in _Section 9.04(a)_.

 



 

Section 3.02 _Allocated Values_. The Partnership and Contributors agree that
the unadjusted Contribution Consideration is allocated among the Assets in the
amounts set forth in _Exhibit A Part 2_ and _Exhibit A Part 1-2_ or

Values, as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement and to reflect the fair market
value of the Equity Consideration on the Closing Date (with such fair market
value being calculated, consistent with the Partnerships past practice, based
on the closing price of a Partnership Common Unit on the Closing Date), shall
be used by Contributors and the Partnership as the basis for reporting Asset

Returns, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, which the Partnership
and Contributors shall timely file with the Internal Revenue Service (if
required to be filed by the Partnership or Contributors) and (b) that neither

other documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless required to do so by a final determination as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code. NGP, the Contributor Representative and the
Partnership shall confer and the Contributors and the Partnership shall
cooperate on any revisions to the allocation of the Contribution
Consideration, including reporting any matters that require updating
(including adjustments to the Contribution Consideration) to be consistent
with the agreed allocation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV 
TITLE MATTERS**

 



 

Section 4.01 _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations;
Special Warranty_.

 



 

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_. Except for
the special warranty of title as set forth in _Section 4.01(b)_ and without
limiting the Partnerships remedies for Title Defects set forth in this
Article IV, Contributors and the Company Entities make no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Company Entities title to any of the Assets, and the Partnership hereby
acknowledges and agrees that (except for breaches of any of the covenants set
forth in _Section 7.02(b)(xiii)_ , for which the Partnership will have the
remedies provided in _Article XIII_ ) the Partnerships sole remedy for any
Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets shall be as set forth in this
_Article IV_.

 



 

(b) _Special Warranty_. If the Closing occurs, then effective as of the
Closing Date, Contributors warrant Defensible Title as of the Closing Date to
the Wells and Non-

 



      
 

 



 

Producing Leases unto the Partnership against any Person whomsoever lawfully
claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under the
Company Entities, but not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted
Encumbrances.

 



 

Section 4.02 _Title Examination Period_. Commencing on the date of the
execution of this Agreement and ending at 5:00 p.m. Houston time on the day
that is 10 days prior to Closing (the " **Title Examination Period** "), the
Company Entities shall, subject to _Section 7.01_ , (a) permit the Partnership
and/or its representatives to examine, in a reasonable manner, at reasonable
times and in the offices of each Company Entity, all abstracts of title, title
opinions, title files, ownership maps, property files, assignments, division
orders, operating records and agreements (including the Contracts) pertaining
to the Assets insofar as same may now be in existence and in the possession of
the Company Entities and (b) subject to Third Party operator approval (which
the Company Entities shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain), permit the Partnership and/or its representatives, at reasonable
times and at the Partnerships sole risk, cost and expense, to conduct
reasonable inspections of the Assets (other than environmental inspections
which are covered by _Section 5.01_ ). The Company Entities shall also make
available to the Partnership and/or its representatives, upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours, the Company Entities personnel
knowledgeable with respect to the Assets in order that the Partnership may
make such diligence investigation as the Partnership considers desirable.

 



 

Section 4.03 _Title Defects_. An Asset or Assets shall be deemed to have a "
**Title Defect** " if the Company Entities are found to have less than
Defensible Title thereto and it is reasonably estimated to (a) require an
expenditure of $35,000 or more to remedy or (b) reduce the value of an Asset
or Assets by an amount of $35,000 or more. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " **Defensible Title** " shall mean such record title of the Company
Entities that, subject to and except for the Permitted Encumbrances:

 



 

(i) with respect to the Identified Zone of any Well or Non-Producing Lease
shown in _Exhibit A Part 2_ or _Exhibit A Part 1-2_, as applicable:

 



 

(A) entitles the Company Entities to receive not less than the percentage set
forth in _Exhibit A Part 2_ as the Net Revenue Interest for such Well of all
Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from the Identified Zone of such
Well without reduction of such interest throughout the duration of the life of
such Well except as otherwise set forth in _Exhibit A Part 2_;

 



 

(B) obligates the Company Entities to bear the Working Interest of the
Identified Zone of such Well not greater than the Working Interest for such
Well (shown in _Exhibit A Part 2_), without increase throughout the duration
of the life of such Well, except (1) increases resulting from contribution
requirements with respect to defaulting co-owners under applicable operating
agreements, (2) increases to the extent that they are accompanied by a
proportionate increase in the Company Entities corresponding Net Revenue
Interest, and (3) as otherwise set forth in _Exhibit A Part 2_;

 



 

(C) with respect to Non-Producing Leases, entitles the Company Entities to
explore for Hydrocarbons and produce Hydrocarbons from

 



      
 

 



 

the lands covering the Net Acres set forth in _Exhibit A Part 1-2_ with
respect to the Identified Zone of such Non-Producing Lease;

 



 

(ii) with respect to Assets other than the Properties, is defensible;

 



 

(iii) is not subject to an adverse claim that would interfere materially with
the ownership, use, operation or value of the Assets; and

 



 

(iv) is free and clear of all Liens.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following shall constitute a Title
Defect: (1) the loss of or reduction of interest in any Well, Non-Producing
Lease or other Property following the date hereof due to any election or
decision made by a Company Entity in accordance with applicable joint
operating agreements as permitted under this Agreement; or (2) the matters set
forth on _Schedule 4.03_ and waived by the Partnership in its sole discretion.
In evaluating whether an adverse claim, Lien or other objection to title
constitutes a Title Defect, due consideration shall be given to the following
matters to the extent that they would be customarily acceptable to prudent
acquirers: defects that have been cured by possession under applicable
statutes of limitation, defects in the early chain of title such as failure to
recite marital status in documents, omission of heirship or succession
proceedings, lack of survey and failure to record releases of lien, and
production payments or mortgages that have expired of their own terms, in each
case to the extent such objections represent matters that are not reasonably
expected to result in claims that will adversely affect the Company Entities
title to such Property.

 



 

Section 4.04 _Notice of Title Defects_. Should the Partnership or its
representatives discover any Title Defect on or before the end of the Title
Examination Period, the Partnership shall have the right to notify the Company
Entities on or before the end of the Title Examination Period. To be
effective, such notice (a " **Title Defect Notice** ") shall be in writing and
shall include (a) a description of each alleged Title Defect, (b) the Asset or
Assets or portion thereof affected thereby (each, a " **Title Defect
Property** "), (c) the value of such Title Defect Property (which shall be the
Allocated Value thereof), and (d) the amount which the Partnership reasonably
believes to be the Title Defect Amount resulting from such alleged Title
Defect. Subject to the Partnerships rights with respect to any breach by
Contributors of _Section 4.01(b)_ or the Company Entities of _Section 7.02_ ,
any matters that may otherwise constitute Title Defects but that are not
specifically disclosed to the Company Entities pursuant to a Title Defect
Notice delivered to the Company Entities prior to the expiration of the Title
Examination Period shall be deemed to have been waived by the Partnership, on
behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, for all purposes.

 



 

Section 4.05 _Remedies for Title Defects_. The Company Entities shall have the
option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure, or cause to be cured, any
Title Defect prior to Closing. Costs paid or payable by the Company Entities
attributable to curing any Title Defect prior to Closing shall be considered
Title Defect Amounts for purposes of this Agreement. The Partnership shall
have the right to waive any Title Defect. Subject to _Section 4.06_ , in the
event that any Title Defect for which an effective Title Defect Notice was
timely given is not cured or waived on or before Closing, and the Partnership
and the Company Entities agree that the Title Defect is valid and agree on the
cost to remedy or the reduction in the value of the Title Defect

 



   

     
 

 



 

Property as a result of the Title Defect (the " **Title Defect Amount** "),
the Contribution Consideration will be reduced by the Title Defect Amount
pursuant to _Section 9.02_. If the Company Entities and the Partnership do not
so agree on the validity of the Title Defect or the Title Defect Amount, the
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 4.09_.

 



 

Section 4.06 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (a) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Contribution
Consideration or other remedies under this Agreement for any Title Defect if
the sum of all Title Defect Amounts does not exceed $5,000,000 (the " **Title
Defect Deductible** "), (b) in the event that the sum of all Title Defect
Amounts exceeds the Title Defect Deductible, then any adjustments to the
Contribution Consideration or other remedies provided by the Company Entities
pursuant to _Section 4.05_ shall be applicable to the portion of all Title
Defect Amounts in excess of the Title Defect Deductible, and (c) subject to
the Partnerships rights with respect to any breach by Contributors of
_Section 4.01(b)_ and by the Company Entities of _Section 7.02_ , _Section
4.05_ (as limited by this _Section 4.06_ ) shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law and without duplication, be the exclusive right
and remedy of the Partnership with respect to any Title Defect or any other
title matter related to the Assets and the Partnership waives any and all
other rights, at law or in equity, with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 4.07 _Title Defect Amount_. The Title Defect Amount resulting from a
Title Defect shall be the amount by which the Adjusted Allocated Value of the
applicable Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of
such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following
terms and conditions:

 



 

(a) if the Partnership and the Company Entities agree on the Title Defect
Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(b) if the Title Defect is a Lien that is undisputed and liquidated in amount,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to
remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(c) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (ii) the Net Revenue Interest
stated therefor in _Exhibit A Part 2_ then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the product of the Adjusted Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in
_Exhibit A Part 2_;

 



 

(d) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (i) the Net Acres for
any Title Defect Property and (ii) the Net Acres stated therefor in _Exhibit A
Part 1-2_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Adjusted
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Acres decrease and the denominator of which is
the Net Acres stated in _Exhibit A Part 1-2_;

 



 

(e) if the Title Defect represents a Liability upon, Lien upon or other defect
in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above, the Title
Defect Amount shall be

 



      
 

 



 

determined by taking into account the Adjusted Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the
Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic
effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property and such
other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;
provided, however, that if such Title Defect is reasonably capable of being
cured, the Title Defect Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost
and expense of curing such Title Defect;

 



 

(f) the Title Defect Amount with respect to each Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 



 

(g) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.07_ , the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon a Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Adjusted Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property.

 



 

Section 4.08 _Title Benefits._

 



 

(a) Should a Company Entity (or its representatives) discover any Title
Benefit on or before the end of the Title Examination Period, the Company
Entities shall have the right to notify the Partnership on or before the end
of the Title Examination Period, which notice shall include (i) a description
of the Title Benefit(s), (ii) the Asset(s) affected (each, a " **Title Benefit
Property** "), (iii) the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property, and
(iv) the amount by which the Company Entities reasonably believe the Allocated
Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by the alleged Title
Benefit.

 



 

(b) With respect to each Title Benefit Property, (i) if the Net Revenue
Interest of the Identified Zone of such Title Benefit Property is greater than
the Net Revenue Interest stated therefor on _Exhibit A Part 2_, then any
reduction in the Contribution Consideration on account of Title Defects shall
be offset by an amount equal to the product of the Adjusted Allocated Value of
such Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the actual Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is
the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit A Part 2_, (ii) if the Working
Interest of the Identified Zone of such Title Benefit Property is less than
the Working Interest stated therefor on _Exhibit A Part 2_ (without a
proportionate reduction in the corresponding Net Revenue Interest stated on
_Exhibit A Part 2_), then any reduction in the Contribution Consideration on
account of Title Defects shall be offset by an amount mutually agreed by the
Company Entities and the Partnership, and (iii) if the Net Acres of the
Identified Zone of such Title Benefit Property is greater than the Net Acres
stated therefor on _Exhibit A Part 1-2_, then any reduction in the
Contribution Consideration on account of Title Defects shall be offset by an
amount equal to the product of the Adjusted Allocated Value of such Title
Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
additional Net Acres and the denominator of which is the Net Acres stated on
_Exhibit A Part 1-2_. The amount by which any reduction in the Contribution
Consideration on account of Title Defects may be offset pursuant to the
preceding sentences of this _Section 4.08(b)_ shall be referred to herein as
the " **Title Benefit Amount**." It is understood that the Title Benefit
Amount shall only serve to offset reductions in the Contribution Consideration
on account of Title Defects and will not be used for any other adjustment
related to the Contribution Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.09 _Title Dispute Resolution_. The Partnership and the Company
Entities shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts (in each case for which the proper
notice was timely given) prior to Closing. If such Parties are unable to agree
by Closing, the Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title
Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant
to this _Section 4.09_. The Partnership and the Company Entities agree to
pursue any such arbitration in good faith and with reasonable diligence, with
the goal of concluding the arbitration as soon as practicable. There shall be
a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10)
years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the relevant
jurisdiction in which the Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of the Partnership and the Company Entities within ten (10)
days after either the Partnership or the Company Entities have provided the
other with a notice of dispute invoking this _Section 4.09_ , and absent such
agreement, by the Dallas office of the American Arbitration Association (the "
**Title Arbitrator** "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Dallas,
Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not
conflict with the terms of this _Section 4.09_. The Title Arbitrators
determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the
matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon all Parties, without
right of appeal. In making his determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be
bound by the rules set forth in this _Article IV_ and, subject to the
foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Title
Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator,
however, may not award the Partnership a greater Title Defect Amount than the
Title Defect Amount claimed by the Partnership in its applicable Title Defect
Notice and may not award Contributors a greater Title Benefit Amount than the
Title Benefit Amount claimed by the Company Entities in their applicable Title
Benefit Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defects, Title Benefits,
Title Defect Amounts and/or Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either the
Partnership or the Company Entities and may not award damages, interest or
penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. The Parties shall each bear
their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of the
Partnership, on one hand, and the Company Entities, on the other hand, shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Closing shall be
delayed until no earlier than the delivery by the Title Arbitrator of his
award. Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 4.06_ and _Section
4.08_ and without duplication under _Section 9.02_ , the Contribution
Consideration at Closing shall be reduced by any Title Defect Amount awarded
by the Title Arbitrator and shall be increased by any Title Benefit Amount
awarded by the Title Arbitrator (to the extent offsetting reductions in the
Contribution Consideration on account of Title Defects).

 



 

Section 4.10 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. With respect to each preferential
purchase right pertaining to a Property and the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company Entities, within five (5) days of the date hereof, shall
send to the holder of each such right a notice, in material compliance with
the contractual provisions applicable to such right. The Partnership shall
promptly notify the Company Entities of any preferential purchase right
triggered by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that it discovers
prior to the Closing that is not set forth in _Schedule 6.02(v)_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
ENVIRONMENTAL**

 



 

Section 5.01 _Environmental Examination Period_. Commencing on the date of the
execution of this Agreement and ending at 5:00 p.m. Houston time on the date
that is (i) with respect to Assets operated by the Company Entities, 10 days
prior to Closing or (ii) with respect to Assets not operated by the Company
Entities, 5 days prior to Closing (the " **Environmental Examination Period**
"), the Company Entities shall, subject to Third Party operator and surface
owner approval (which, upon the Partnerships request, the Company Entities
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain) and the provisions of
_Section 7.01,_ permit the Partnership and/or its representatives, in a
reasonable manner, at reasonable times and at the Partnerships sole risk,
liability, cost and expense, to conduct reasonable (1) non-invasive
environmental inspections of the Assets or (2) subject to the Company
Entities prior consent, other environmental inspections of the Assets;
provided that (a) the Partnership shall provide the Company Entities with
prior notice of any activities with respect to any such environmental
inspections, and shall provide the Company Entities the opportunity to
accompany the Partnership or its representatives in all such activities; (b)
any contractor engaged to perform all or any portion of such environmental
inspection shall execute and deliver to the Company Entities a confidentiality
agreement with respect to such environmental inspection; and (c) in the event
that the Partnership desires to perform an invasive inspection of a Property
that is operated by a Third Party, the Company Entities shall reasonably
cooperate with the Partnership in its efforts to obtain authorization to
perform such inspections from such operator. The Partnership agrees to
indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the Company Entities and Contributors
from any and all Liabilities for personal injury or property damage incurred
or suffered by any of the Company Entities or Contributors in connection with
the Partnerships performance of the environmental inspections, except to the
extent attributable to the negligence, gross negligence or intentional act of
the Company Entities or their employees, assignees, or invitees (other than
the Partnership and its representatives).

 



 

Section 5.02 _Environmental Defect_. An Asset shall be deemed to have an "
**Environmental Defect** " if the Partnership discovers that such Asset is
subject to (a) a condition existing on the date of this Agreement with respect
to the air, soil, subsurface, surface waters, ground waters and/or sediments
that causes an Asset (or any Company Entity with respect to an Asset) not to
be in compliance with any Environmental Law, (b) the existence as of the date
of this Agreement with respect to such Asset or the ownership or operation
thereof of any environmental pollution, contamination, degradation, damage or
injury where remedial or corrective action is presently required by a
Governmental Authority (or if known to that Governmental Authority, would be
presently required) under Environmental Laws, or (c) any operational or
permitting requirements imposed under Environmental Laws and fails to be in
compliance with such requirements.

 



 

Section 5.03 _Notice of Environmental Defects_. If the Partnership discovers
any Environmental Defect, the Partnership shall notify the Company Entities
thereof prior to the expiration of the Environmental Examination Period. To be
effective, such notice (an " **Environmental Defect Notice** ") shall be in
writing and shall include (a) a reasonably detailed description of each
alleged Environmental Defect, (b) a reasonably detailed description of the
Asset or portion thereof allegedly affected thereby (each, an "
**Environmental Defect**

 



      
 

 



 

 **Property** "), (c) the asserted value of such Environmental Defect Property
(which shall be the Allocated Value thereof), (d) the Remediation Amount that
the Partnership asserts is attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect,
and (e) to the extent available, a copy of the Partnerships consultants
reports with respect to the Environmental Defect. The Partnerships
calculation of the Remediation Amount of any alleged Environmental Defect
included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable detail
the cure or investigation proposed for the alleged Environmental Defect and
identify the key assumptions used by the Partnership in calculating the cost
estimate. Any matters that may otherwise constitute Environmental Defects but
that are not specifically disclosed to the Company Entities pursuant to an
Environmental Defect Notice prior to the expiration of the Environmental
Examination Period shall be deemed to have been waived by the Partnership, on
behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, for all purposes (other than
_Section 6.02(r)_ ).

 



 

Section 5.04 _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. The Company Entities shall
have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure, or cause to be
cured, any Environmental Defect prior to Closing. Costs paid or payable by the
Company Entities attributable to curing any Environmental Defects prior to
Closing shall be considered Environmental Defect Amounts for purposes of this
Agreement. The Partnership shall have the right to waive any Environmental
Defect. Subject to _Section 5.05_ , in the event that any Environmental Defect
is not cured or waived on or before Closing, and the Partnership and the
Company Entities agree that the Environmental Defect is valid and agree on the
Remediation Amount to cure such Environmental Defect (the " **Environmental
Defect Amount** "), then the Contribution Consideration will be reduced by the
Environmental Defect Amount pursuant to _Section 9.02_. If such Parties do not
so agree on the validity of the Environmental Defect or the Environmental
Defect Amount, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions
of _Section 5.06_.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (a) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Contribution
Consideration or other remedies under this Agreement for any Environmental
Defect if the Environmental Defect Amount is less than $35,000, (b) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Contribution Consideration or
other remedies under this Agreement for any Environmental Defect if the sum of
all Environmental Defect Amounts does not exceed $5,000,000 (the "
**Environmental Defect Deductible** "), (c) in the event that the sum of all
Environmental Defect Amounts exceeds the Environmental Defect Deductible, then
any adjustments to the Contribution Consideration or other remedies provided
by the Company Entities pursuant to _Section 5.04_ shall be applicable to the
portion of all Environmental Defect Amounts in excess of the Environmental
Defect Deductible, and (d) except for any breach of the representations in
_Section 6.02(r)_ , _Section 5.04_ (as limited by this _Section 5.05_ ) shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and without duplication, be
the exclusive right and remedy of the Partnership with respect to any
Environmental Defect or any other matter related to the environmental
condition of the Assets, and the Partnership waives any and all other rights,
at law or in equity, with respect thereto.

 



 

Section 5.06 _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. The Partnership and the
Company Entities shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects and
Environmental Defect Amounts prior to Closing. If such Parties are unable to
agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts
in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this _Section
5.06_. The Partnership and the Company Entities agree to pursue any such
arbitration

 



      
 

 



 

in good faith and with reasonable diligence, with the goal of concluding the
arbitration as soon as practicable. There shall be a single arbitrator, who
shall be an environmental consultant with at least ten (10) years experience
in the oil and gas industry involving properties in the relevant jurisdiction
in which the Environmental Defect Properties are located, as selected by
mutual agreement of the Partnership and the Company Entities within ten (10)
days after either the Partnership or the Company Entities have provided the
other with a notice of dispute invoking this _Section 5.06_ , and absent such
agreement, by the Dallas office of the American Arbitration Association (the "
**Environmental Arbitrator** "). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Dallas, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Environmental
Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon all
Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
_Article V_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as
in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper
determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award the
Partnership a greater Environmental Defect Amount than the Environmental
Defect Amount claimed by the Partnership in its applicable Environmental
Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and
Environmental Defect Amounts submitted by either the Partnership or the
Company Entities and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any Party
with respect to any matter. The Parties shall each bear their own legal fees
and other costs of presenting its case. Each of the Partnership, on one hand,
and the Company Entities, on the other hand, shall bear one-half of the costs
and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Closing shall be delayed until no earlier than the
delivery by the Environmental Arbitrator of his award. The Contribution
Consideration at Closing shall be reduced by any Environmental Defect Amount
awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 5.05_ without duplication under _Section 9.02_.

failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not materially hinder or
impede the consummation by such Contributor of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Authorization / Consents_.

 



 

(i) If such Contributor is not a natural person, the execution and delivery by
such Contributor of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations

(d) _Enforceability_. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
such Contributor and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
such Contributor, enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions
except insofar as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or

and by general principles of equity (the " **Enforceability Exceptions** ").
At Closing, all documents contemplated by this Agreement to be executed and
delivered by such Contributor shall have been duly executed and delivered by
such Contributor and all such documents executed and delivered by such
Contributor shall constitute valid and binding obligations of such
Contributor, enforceable in accordance with their terms and conditions except
insofar as the enforceability thereof may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions.

 



 

(e) _Noncontravention_. Neither the execution and the delivery of this
Agreement by such Contributor, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by such Contributor will conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of termination, modification, revocation,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit
under, give rise to a right of purchase as to the Company Interests, or result
in the creation of any claim upon any of the Company Entities or the Company
Interests under, any provision of (A) any applicable Law, (B) if such
Contributor is not a natural person, the Organizational Documents of such
Contributor, or (C) any contract or instrument to which such Contributor is a
party or by which it is bound.

 



 

(f) _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits or proceedings, arbitrations or
disputes, claims, audits or investigations, whether administrative, judicial
or otherwise that are pending or, to the knowledge of such Contributor,

(g) _Title to Company Interests_. Such Contributor is the record and
beneficial owner of the applicable Company Interests separately disclosed by
such Contributor to the Partnership in writing contemporaneous with its
execution hereof, free and clear of all Liens. Such Company Interests
constitute all of the Company Interests or other equity interests or rights to
acquire any such interests (including any incentive rights or participation in
the profits or appreciation in value of any Company Entity) in any Company
Entity held by such Contributor.

 



 

(h) _Foreign Person_. Such Contributor is not a "foreign person" or a
"disregarded entity" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(i) _Investment Representation_. If such Contributor is to receive Partnership
Common Units pursuant to this Agreement, such Contributor warrants as follows:

 



 

(i) the Partnership Common Units to be issued pursuant to this Agreement will
be acquired for investment for such Contributors own account, not as a
nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any
part thereof, and such Contributor has no present intention of selling,
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. Such
Contributor does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement
with any Person to sell, transfer or grant participations to such Person or to
any Third Party, with respect to any of the Partnership Common Units to be
issued hereunder;

 



 

(ii) such Contributor understands that the Partnership Common Units to be
issued hereunder are not registered under the Securities Act on the ground
that the sale provided for in this Agreement and the issuance of securities
hereunder is exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant to
Section 4(2) thereof and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder;

 



 

(iii) such Contributor believes it has received all the information such
Contributor considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to invest
in the Partnership Common Units to be issued hereunder. Such Contributor has
had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the Partnership
regarding the terms and conditions of the offering of the Partnership Common
Units to be issued hereunder and the business, properties, prospects and
financial condition of the Partnership;

 



 

(iv) such Contributor confirms that it has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that such Contributor is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in the Partnership Common Units to be
issued hereunder and of making an informed investment decision and understands
that, without limiting a Contributors ability to rely on the Partnerships
representations and warranties under this Agreement, (x) this investment is
suitable only for an investor which is able to bear the economic consequences
of losing its entire investment, (y) the exchange of Company Interests with
the Partnership Common Units to be issued hereunder is a speculative
investment which involves a high degree of risk of loss of the entire
investment, and (z) there are substantial restrictions on the transferability
of the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership Common Units to be issued hereunder, and accordingly, it may not
be possible for such Contributor to liquidate its investment in case of
emergency;

 



 

(v) such Contributor is an "accredited investor," as such term is defined in
Rule 501(e) under the Securities Act; and

 



 

(vi) such Contributor understands that none of the Partnership Common Units to
be issued hereunder may be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and that in
the absence of either an effective registration statement covering such sale
or disposition or an available exemption from registration under the
Securities Act, the Partnership Common Units to be issued hereunder must be
held indefinitely. In particular, such Contributor is aware that the
Partnership Common Units to be issued hereunder may not be sold pursuant to
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act unless all of the conditions of
that Rule are met.

 



 

(j) _Taxes_. Such Contributor has reviewed with its own Tax advisors the
federal, state, local and the other Tax consequences of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Such Contributor acknowledges and agrees that
the Partnership is not making any representation or warranty as to the
federal, state, local or other Tax consequences to such Contributor as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as otherwise
provided pursuant to _Sections 15.01(c)_ , _15.01(d)_ and _15.01(e)_ , such
Contributor understands that it (and not the Partnership) shall be responsible
for such Contributors own Tax Liability that may arise as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(k) _Brokers  Fees_. Except as described on _Schedule 6.01(k)_ , such
Contributor does not have any Liability to pay any fees or commissions to any
broker, finder or agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for which the Partnership or the Company Entities will be liable or
obligated or which would otherwise burden the Assets.

 



 

Section 6.02 _Representations and Warranties Regarding the Company Entities_.
The Company Entities hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Partnership as follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization of the Company Entities_. Each Company Entity is duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation.

 



 

(b) _Qualification of the Company Entities_. Each Company Entity is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business as now conducted makes such qualification
necessary.

 



 

(c) _Consents_. Subject to compliance with the preferential rights to purchase
set forth on _Schedule 6.02(v)_ , and other than as set forth on _Schedule
6.02(c)_ , there are no Approvals required for any Company Entity from or to
any Governmental Authority or any other Third Party, in each case, in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

and preferential rights to purchase set forth on _Schedule 6.02(v)_ and (ii)
the release at the Closing of the mortgages and security interests upon the
Assets securing the Existing Credit Facility, neither the execution and the
delivery of this Agreement by the Company Entities or Contributors, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Contributors or the
Company Entities will conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, modification, revocation, cancellation or acceleration
of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, give rise to a right of
purchase as to the Company Interests, or result in the creation of any claim
upon any of the Company Entities or the Company Interests under any provision
of (A) any applicable Law, (B) the Organizational Documents of any Company
Entity or (C) any Material Contract.

 



 

(e) _Litigation_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 6.02(e)_ , there are no
actions, suits or proceedings, arbitrations or disputes, claims (other than
routine claims under any Employee Plan), audits or investigations, whether
administrative, judicial or otherwise that are pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company Entities, threatened, by or against any Company Entity or, to the
Knowledge of the Company Entities, affecting any Assets.

issued and outstanding Company Interests or other equity interests of each
Company Entity. The Company Interests or other equity interests of each

Company Entity is or was a party or by which it is or was otherwise bound.
There are no certificates representing any of the Company Interests. The
Partnership has been provided with true and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents, minute books, membership interest certificate books,
membership interest transfer books and equity ledgers of each Company Entity
to the extent the same are in existence.

 



 

(ii) Except to the extent set forth in the CC Equity Documents, there are no

obligating any Company Entity (A) to issue, sell, pledge, dispose of or
encumber any Company Interest or other equity interests of any Company Entity

Interests or other equity interests of any Company Entity (excluding the

the Company) as security in connection with the Existing Credit Facility), (B)
to redeem, purchase or acquire in any manner any Company Interests or other
equity interests of any Company Entity or any securities that are convertible,

appreciation, phantom unit, profit participation, or similar rights affecting
the Company Interests or other equity interests of any Company Entity or any

transfer, delivery, right of first refusal, option or limitation on transfer
of any of the Company Interests or other equity interests of any Company
Entity or any securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable
into any Company Interests or other equity interests of any Company Entity.

 



 

(g) _Other Equity Interests and Joint Ventures_. Except as set forth in

2010, including the balance sheets of the Company Entities as of December 31,
2009 and December 31, 2010 (collectively, as the " **Financial Statements**

(i) The Company Entities have no Liabilities of any kind, whether accrued,
absolute, fixed, contingent or otherwise, that would have been required to be

SEC).

extent applicable to the Existing Credit Facility or the ISDAs) of the Company
Entities as of the date of this Agreement, identifying the creditor including

owed. With respect to each item of Indebtedness, the Company Entities are not
in default and no payments are past due, and no circumstance exists that, with
notice, the passage of time or both, could constitute a default by the Company
Entities under any item of Indebtedness. The Company Entities have not
received any notice of a default, alleged failure to perform or any offset or
counterclaim with respect to any item of Indebtedness that has not been fully
remedied and withdrawn. No Company Entity has guaranteed or is responsible or
liable for any Indebtedness of any other Person (excluding another Company
Entity).

 



 

(iii) No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that has
resulted in, or that will or would reasonably be expected to result in, any
claim for indemnification, reimbursement, contribution, or the advancement of
expenses by any Company Employee (other than a claim for reimbursement by the
Company Entities, in the Ordinary Course of Business, of travel expenses or
other out of pocket expenses of a routine nature incurred by a Company
Employee in the course of performing such Company Employees duties for the
Company Entities) pursuant to: (A) the terms of the Organizational Documents
of any Company Entity; (ii) any indemnification agreement or other contract
between the Company Entities and any Company Employee; or (iii) any applicable
Law.

Entity has signed any authorizations for expenditures (collectively, "
**AFEs** ") exceeding $150,000 net to the Company Entities interest, elected
to be a non-consent co-owner with respect to any AFE or any applicable pooling

filing of all notices, forms and agreements as may be necessary to obtain any
Approval of any Governmental Authority that may be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Approval held
by the Company Entities or required for the operation of the Assets; provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to the FCC license listed in _Schedule
6.02(d)_. The Partnership agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Company Entities to obtain any such consents to the extent
reasonably requested by the Company Entities.

 



 

Section 7.06 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the Parties will use all commercially reasonable efforts to

under this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the transactions.

 



 

Section 7.07 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Contributors, the Company
Entities and the Partnership shall each give prompt written notice to the
other of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of and shall provide
accurate and complete copies of any and all information relating to, any event
of which it becomes aware that has caused or that would be likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof
to the Closing, and (b) the failure of such Party, or any officer, director,
manager, employee, or agent of such Party, to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder. A notifying Party under this _Section 7.07_ shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure or remedy, before the Closing,
any occurrence of (a) or (b) in the preceding sentence. No such notification
shall affect the representations or warranties of the Parties or the
conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.08 _Continuation of Company Entities  Existing Indemnification
Obligations_. For a period of four **** years from and after the Closing, each
Company Entity or its successor shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Contributor and each other Person who has been at any time prior to the
Closing, an officer, director or controlling member of any Company Entity
(collectively, the " **Indemnified Parties** ") but only to the extent that
such Indemnified Party was entitled to indemnification from such Company
Entity immediately prior to the date hereof under the Organizational Documents
of such Company Entity in such Indemnified Parties capacity as an officer,
director or member of such Company Entity, regardless of whether such
contracts are terminated on or after the Closing. The indemnification
obligations of the Company Entities in the Advisory Services Agreement shall
survive in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Services Agreement, but
in no event shall such obligations survive beyond the date that is four

 



      
 

 



 

years after the Closing. The procedures associated with such indemnification
shall be the same as those associated with the Indemnified Parties
indemnification from the applicable Company Entity immediately prior to the
date hereof (provided, however, that the Partnership shall be under no
obligation to deposit trust funds pursuant to any "change-in-control" or
similar provisions). The provisions of this _Section 7.08_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties, each Indemnified
Party and their respective heirs and representatives. Nothing in this _Section
7.08_ shall preclude any Partnership Indemnitee from asserting and recovering
Liabilities pursuant to _Section 13.02_ that such Partnership Indemnitee is
otherwise able to assert and recover pursuant to _Section 13.02_, and the
indemnification provisions of this _Section 7.08_ (including those contained
in the Organizational Documents and the Advisory Services Agreement) shall not
cover amounts that are paid pursuant to _Section 13.02_.

 



 

Section 7.09 _Lessor Consent_. The Company Entities shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Lessor Consent to be delivered to
the Company Entities prior to the Closing.

NGP agree to reasonably cooperate with the Partnership (without any obligation
to incur any out-of-pocket expense) in the Partnerships efforts to reduce any

The Company Entities agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
secure the releases and terminations described in _Section 8.02(m)_.

77002, at 10:00 a.m., Houston time, on May 3, 2011 (the " **Closing Date** ")
or such earlier or later date as is mutually agreed by the Parties.

 



 

Section 9.02 _Adjustments to Contribution Consideration at Closing._

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Contribution Consideration shall be increased by any
amount agreed upon by NGP, the Contributor Representative and the Partnership.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Contribution Consideration shall be decreased by the
following amounts:

 



 

(i) the amount of any and all expenses of the Company Entities relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any fees and expenses
of counsel, financial advisors or other advisors, severance expenses (without
duplication), expenses of termination and/or wind-down or benefit plans or

than any such expenses directly related to the business of the Company
Entities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business;

 



 

(iii) the sum of all Title Defect Amounts (subject to _Section 4.06_ and as
offset by the sum of all Title Benefit Amounts **** to the extent provided in
_Section 4.08_) with respect to the Assets pursuant to _Section 4.05_ and
the sum of all Environmental Defect Amounts (subject to _Section 5.05_) with
respect to the Assets pursuant to _Section 5.04_;

 



 

(iv) the fees, costs and expenses borne by the Company Entities pursuant to
_Section 4.09_ or _Section 5.06_;

 



 

(v) the amount of any uninsured Casualty Losses occurring with respect to the
Assets between the date of this Agreement and the Closing;

 



 

(vi) in the event there is a termination of the Tulsa Office Lease, the sum of
all costs and expenses paid or payable by the Company Entities in connection
with such termination;

 



 

(vii) amounts contemplated by the last sentence of _Section 15.01(a)(iii)_;

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) $75,000; and

 



 

(ix) any other amount provided for in this Agreement or agreed upon by
Contributors and the Partnership.

 



 

(c) The Company Entities shall provide to the Partnership their good faith
estimate, together with reasonable supporting documentation, of the amounts
set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_ and _Section 9.02(b)_ at least five Business
Days prior to the Closing, and absent manifest errors, such estimates (other
than any disputed portions of the adjustments) shall be used at the Closing,
subject to adjustment as set forth herein. If the Partnership disputes any of
the adjustments and notifies the Contributors of such dispute at least two
Business Days prior to Closing, the disputed amounts shall be excluded from
the calculation of the adjusted Contribution Consideration to be used at
Closing, and shall be resolved after Closing through the procedures set forth
in this _Section 9.02(c)_ and _Section 9.02(d)_. The Partnership shall
prepare within 120 days after the Closing Date and furnish to NGP and the
Contributor Representative a final accounting statement setting forth the
adjustments and pro-rating of any amounts provided for in this _Article IX_
or elsewhere in this Agreement (the " **Final Accounting Statement** ")
together with reasonable supporting documentation. NGP and the Contributor
Representative shall within 30 days after receipt of the Final Accounting
Statement deliver to the Partnership a written report (together with
reasonable supporting documentation) containing any changes that NGP and the
Contributor Representative propose be made to such Final Accounting Statement
(the " **Dispute Notice** "). Such Parties shall undertake to agree on the
final adjustment amounts and such final adjustment amounts shall be paid by
Contributors or the Partnership, as appropriate, not later than 5 days after
such agreement. During the foregoing periods of time, any Party may at its own
expense audit the other Partys books, accounts and records to the extent
relevant to the adjustments under this _Section 9.02_. Such audit shall be
conducted so as to cause a minimum of inconvenience to the audited Party. The
occurrence of the Closing shall not relieve any Party of its obligation to
account to another Party after the Closing with respect to amounts that are
received or become due after the Closing and that are properly payable or
chargeable to any Party pursuant to any provision of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 9.02(d)_, any payment to be made by
the Contributors attributable to the Final Accounting Statement shall be paid
directly by the Contributors to the Partnership and such amount shall not be
paid out of the Holdback Amount. NGP (but not the other Contributors) shall be
permitted to pay any such payment using Partnership Common Units other than
Holdback Units with such Partnership Common Units to be valued on the date of
payment as if such payment date is the "disbursement instruction date"
pursuant to _Section 13.04(b)_.

 



 

(d) If NGP, the Contributor Representative and the Partnership are unable to
resolve the matters addressed in the Dispute Notice, each of the Partnership,
on the one hand, and NGP and the Contributor Representative, on the other
hand, shall, within 15 Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute
Notice, summarize its position with regard to such dispute in a written
document and submit such summaries to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or such
other party as such Parties may mutually select (the " **Accounting
Arbitrator** "), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Accounting
Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within
30 Business Days after receiving such Parties respective submissions, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either NGP/Contributor
Representatives position or the Partnerships position with respect to each
matter addressed in

 



      
 

 



 

any Dispute Notice, based on the materials described above. Any decision
rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Contributors and the Partnership and will be
enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The costs of such Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by the
Partnership and one-half by Contributors.

 



 

Section 9.03 _Actions of Contributors at Closing_. At the Closing NGP, the
Contributor Representative or the Contributors, as applicable, shall deliver

to the Partnership Indemnitees pursuant to this Agreement and for other

Contributor Representative on behalf of such Contributor pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement.

 



 

Each Contributor (excluding NGP) acknowledges that the powers and authority
granted in this _Section 10.01_ are coupled with an interest sufficient in
Law to support an irrevocable power of attorney and, unless this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article XII_, shall be irrevocable to the fullest
extent permitted by Law. Each Contributor (excluding NGP) agrees to indemnify
the Partnership for any claims that arise against the Partnership as a result
of reliance on this power of attorney as to such Contributor. Each Contributor
agrees that it will not bring any claim against the Contributor Representative

Representative on behalf of any of the Contributors), any Holdback Units to be
distributed shall be distributed only to the Contributors originally entitled
to receive such Holdback Units pursuant to this Agreement, or in the event of
the death of such a Contributor, to his or her estate or beneficiaries.

Section 11.02 _Further Cooperation_. After the Closing, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party, at the request of any
other Party and without additional consideration, shall execute and deliver,
or shall cause to be executed and delivered from time to time, such further

other Party may reasonably request to convey and deliver the Company Interests
to the Partnership in the manner contemplated by this Agreement and to
otherwise effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.03 _Document Retention_.

 



 

(a) _Inspection_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 11.03(b)_ and
_Section 15.01(b)_, the Partnership agrees, and will cause the Company
Entities to agree, that the Files shall be open for inspection by
representatives of Contributors at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice

Section 11.04 _Treatment of Excluded Assets_. The Company Entities shall, at

to New Lessee and obtain any consents (including the Lessor Consent) required
in connection therewith. The Partnership acknowledges that the inability of
Contributors to have any Excluded Asset distributed, transferred or assigned
from the Company Entities for any reason shall not delay Closing and any
Excluded Asset that the Company Entities are unable to cause to be so
distributed, transferred or assigned by the Closing shall be referred to as a
" **Non-Transferred Excluded Asset**." Regardless whether any Excluded Asset
is a Non-Transferred Excluded Asset, the Contributors shall cause New Lessee
to assume all Liabilities related to all Excluded Assets from and after the
Closing Date. From and after the Closing with respect to each Non-Transferred
Excluded Asset, the Partnership shall cause the Company Entities to permit New
Lessee to exclusively direct and manage the Company Entities participation in
(and the Partnership shall grant to New Lessee a power of attorney granting
New Lessee a full power of attorney with respect to) all negotiations,
arbitrations, litigation, claims, and/or bankruptcy or other proceedings
involving such Non-Transferred Excluded Asset, whether existing at the Closing
or arising thereafter. The Partnership shall also permit Contributors to
settle or compromise on behalf of the Company Entities any Non-Transferred
Excluded Asset in New Lessees sole discretion, and shall promptly pay to
Contributors any proceeds or recoveries received in connection with any Non-
Transferred Excluded Asset.

 



 

Section 11.05 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) On or before five days prior to the Closing, the Partnership shall notify
the Company Entities in writing of the identity of the Company Employees to
whom the Partnership has made offers of employment and the identity of the
Company Employees who have accepted

 



      
 

 



 

such offers. Such offers of employment by the Partnership Employer shall be
effective at 12:01 am on the day after the Closing Date or 12:01 am of such
later date as to which any such Company Employee on an approved leave of
absence shall have returned from such leave or been released to return to
work. The terms and conditions of each such offer of employment shall be
determined by the Partnership Employer in its sole discretion. The Company
Entities shall assist the Partnership Employer to arrange meetings with
Company Employees and to communicate the offers of employment. As used in this
Agreement, the term " **Continuing Employee** " means each individual who
accepts an offer of employment from the Partnership Employer subject to and
prior to the Closing being consummated. The Partnership shall cause (i) each
Continuing Employee to be credited, for the year during which coverage under
any the Partnership Employer group health plan begins, with any deductibles
and copayments already incurred during such year under the Company Entities
group health plan, (ii) any preexisting condition restrictions, eligibility
waiting periods, evidence of insurability and required physical examinations
to be waived and (iii) each Continuing Employees years of service with the
Company Entities prior to the Closing Date to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit determination under any employee benefit
plans and programs maintained by the Partnership Employer and its Affiliates
or a co-employer of any such entity (other than benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership
Employer and its Affiliates shall have the right, at any time and from time to
time, to change the compensation and terms of employment of any Continuing
Employee who becomes employed by the Partnership Employer and to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit plan or program made available by the Partnership
Employer to any such Continuing Employee.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to confer upon (i) any
Continuing Employee who becomes employed by the Partnership Employer or (ii)
any Company Employee any right to continued employment by the Partnership
Employer or any of the Company Entities, as applicable, at any time after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(c) With respect to individuals employed by any of the Company Entities on or
before the Closing Date who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (within the
meaning assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9), the Partnership shall provide or cause to be provided COBRA
continuation coverage (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code) for
the duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such
coverage.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, those Persons
who do not become Continuing Employees shall have their employment terminated
or transferred to New Lessee on the Closing Date, with any severance paid in
connection therewith being taken into account under _Section 9.02(b)(i)_.

 



 

(e) On or before the Closing Date, the Company Entities shall compensate the
Company Employees for all accrued vacation benefits owed to the Company
Employees.

 



 

Section 11.06 _Equity Consideration Distribution_. Notwithstanding the fact
that the Equity Consideration may be outstanding prior to the record date for
the Partnerships distribution in respect of Partnership Common Units for the
first quarter of 2011, the Equity

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration will not be eligible for, and the Contributors hereby
irrevocably waive their rights to, such distribution.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 12.01 _Right of Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be completely terminated at any time at or prior to
the Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

 



 

(b) by the Partnership upon written notice from the Partnership to the
Contributors or by the Contributors upon written notice from NGP and the
Contributor Representative to the Partnership, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before May 31, 2011; provided, however, that (i) no Party can
so terminate this Agreement if such Party is at such time in material breach
of this Agreement and (ii) such date shall be extended to the extent necessary
to permit the final resolution of any and all disputes being resolved pursuant
to _Section 4.09_ or _Section 5.06_; or

 



 

(c) by the Partnership upon written notice from the Partnership to the
Contributors or by the Contributors upon written notice from NGP and the
Contributor Representative to the Partnership, if the sum of all uncured and
unwaived Title Defect Amounts (as offset by Title Benefit Amounts) and
Environmental Defect Amounts (subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
5.05(a)_) exceeds 15% of the Contribution Consideration.

 



 

Section 12.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that the Closing does not
occur as a result of a Party exercising its right to terminate pursuant to
_Section 12.01_, then, except for the provisions of _Section 1.01_, _Section
1.02_, _Section 7.01_, _Section 10.01_, this _Section 12.02_, _Section
13.09_, _Section 14.01_ and _Article XV_ (other than _Section 15.01_ and
_Section 15.02_), this Agreement shall thereafter be null and void and no
Party shall have any rights or obligations under this Agreement, except that
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from Liability for any willful breach
of its covenants or agreements hereunder. In the event of a termination of
this Agreement as a result of a willful breach by the Partnership, in addition
to other remedies available to the Contributors at law or in equity, the
Partnership shall be liable to the Company Entities and the Contributors for
all expenses incurred by such parties in connection with pursuing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of a termination of
this Agreement as a result of a willful breach by a Contributor or Company
Entity, in addition to other remedies available to the Partnership at law or
in equity, the Company Entities shall be liable to the Partnership for all
expenses incurred by the Partnership in connection with pursuing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 13.01 _Indemnification by the Partnership_. Subject to the other
provisions of this _Article XIII,_ effective as of Closing, the Partnership
will defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless the Contributor Indemnitees
from and against any and all Liabilities caused by, arising

 



      
 

 



 

from, or attributable to the breach by the Partnership of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.02 _Indemnification by Contributors_. Subject to the other
provisions of _Article XIII_, from and after Closing, each Contributor will
defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership Indemnitees
(including, from and after the Closing, any Company Entity and its officers,
directors and/or managers, employees, agents and representatives) from and
against any and all Liabilities caused by, arising from or attributable to (i)
the breach by such Contributor of any of its representations or warranties
contained in _Section 4.01(b)_ or _Section 6.01_ of this Agreement as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing, as though made at and as of the
Closing; (ii) the breach by the Company Entities of any of the representations
or warranties contained in _Section 6.02_ of this Agreement as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing, as though made at and as of the Closing;
(iii) the breach by any Contributor of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; and (iv) the breach by any Company Entity of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be performed by it at or
prior to Closing.

 



 

Section 13.03 _Limitations_. The following limitations shall apply to the
indemnity obligations under _Section 13.01_ or _Section 13.02_, as
applicable:

 



 

(a) Except for breaches of the Fundamental Representations, Contributors shall
not incur, and shall have no obligation to the Partnership Indemnitees under
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with
respect to, any Liability unless written notice of such Liability is provided
to NGP and the Contributor Representative within 12 months after Closing. With
respect to breaches of the Fundamental Representations, Contributors shall not
incur, and shall have no obligation to the Partnership Indemnitees under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with
respect to, any Liability unless written notice of such Liability is provided
to NGP and the Contributor Representative within three years after Closing.

 



 

(b) Except for breaches of the Fundamental Representations or _Section
4.01(b)_, the Partnership Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any
right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 13.02(i)_, _Section
13.02(ii)_, _Section 13.02(iii)_ (to the extent relating to a breach of
_Section 7.02_) or _Section 13.02(iv)_ (to the extent relating to a breach
of _Section 7.02_) until the aggregate amount of all Liabilities actually
suffered by the Partnership Indemnitees in connection therewith exceeds
$1,000,000 (the " **Indemnity Deductible** ") and then only to the extent such
Liabilities exceed, in the aggregate, the Indemnity Deductible.

 



 

(c) Except for breaches of the Fundamental Representations, in no event shall
Contributors ever be required to indemnify the Partnership Indemnitees for
Liabilities under _Section 13.02_ exceeding, in the aggregate, the Holdback
Amount from the Holdback Account. The Parties acknowledge that the dollar
value of the Holdback Units will vary over time and thus the amount in dollar
terms that is available to satisfy indemnity claims will vary. Distributions
of interest and additional units by the Partnership in respect of the Holdback
Units will not be deposited in the Holdback Account. With respect to breaches
of _Section 4.01(b)_, the Contributors indemnification obligation shall not
exceed the lower of (i) the Allocated Value for the Wells and Non-Producing
Leases affected thereunder and (ii) the Holdback Amount.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) With respect to claims for breaches of the Public Company Representations,
the Contributor Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 13.01_ until the aggregate amount of all
Liabilities actually suffered by the Contributor Indemnitees in connection
therewith exceeds $1,000,000, and then only to the extent such Liabilities
exceed, in the aggregate, such deductible, and in no event shall the
Partnership ever be required to indemnify the Contributor Indemnitees for
Liabilities with respect to the Public Company Representations exceeding, in
the aggregate, $31,800,000.

 



 

(e) For purposes of determining whether there is a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Contributors or the Company Entities with
respect to which the Partnership Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
under _Section 13.02_ or a breach of any representation or warranty of the
Partnership with respect to which the Contributor Indemnitees are entitled to
indemnification under _Section 13.01_, all of the representations and
warranties of any Contributor or the Company Entities or the Partnership set
forth in this Agreement that are qualified as to "material," "materially,"
"material respects" or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed to have been
made without any such qualification.

 



 

(f) Except for breaches of _Section 4.01(b)_ or _Section 6.02(r)_, the
Partnership Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 13.02_ with respect to any matter that
would have constituted a Title Defect or an Environmental Defect.

 



 

Section 13.04 _Payment of Indemnity Obligations by Contributors_.

 



 

(a) The Partnerships sole and exclusive remedy for Contributors indemnity
obligations (other than breaches of Fundamental Representations) shall be the
Holdback Amount. The Partnership may, but is not obligated to, satisfy claims
for breaches of Fundamental Representations from the Holdback Amount, and the
full amount of the Holdback Amount shall be available to satisfy any claim for
breach of a Fundamental Representation even if such claim is a several
liability of a Contributor.

 



 

(b) In the event that an indemnity claim pursuant to this _Article XIII_
requires that the Parties direct a disbursement of the Holdback Amount to a
Partnership Indemnitee, then for purposes of valuing the Partnership Common
Units held in the Holdback Account, such Partnership Common Units shall be
valued at the average closing price reported by NASDAQ (as quoted in _The Wall
Street Journal_ ) for the three-day period ending the trading day immediately
preceding the date that disbursement instructions are provided to the Escrow
Agent.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Partnership shall be entitled to all remedies at law or in equity against any
Contributor for breach of a Fundamental Representation, which remedies shall
be cumulative of and in addition to remedies relating to the Holdback Amount.

 



 

Section 13.05 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any indemnification payments made
pursuant to this _Article XIII_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Contribution Consideration.

 



 

Section 13.06 _Joint and Several Liability_. Except for the representations
and warranties set forth in _Section 6.01_, each Contributor shall be jointly
and severally liable for the obligations

 



      
 

 



 

of each of the Contributors and, as provided in _Section 13.02_, the Company
Entities under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Holdback Amount from the Holdback Account shall be available
to satisfy all claims against Contributors or any one of them under this
Agreement and shall in all events be the only recourse for all such claims
(other than with respect to Fundamental Representations).

 



 

Section 13.07 _Negligence and Fault_. THE DEFENSE, RELEASE, INDEMNIFICATION
AND HOLD HARMLESS OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING _SECTION
13.01_ AND _SECTION 13.02_) SHALL ENTITLE THE INDEMNITEE TO SUCH DEFENSE,
RELEASE, INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS HEREUNDER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
TERMS HEREOF, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH OBLIGATION
IS THE RESULT OF: (A) STRICT LIABILITY, (B) THE VIOLATION OF ANY LAW BY SUCH
INDEMNITEE OR BREACH OF DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), (C) THE SOLE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH INDEMNITEE, OR (D) OTHER FAULT OF
SUCH INDEMNITEE.

 



 

Section 13.08 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except to the extent expressly set forth in
any Transaction Document (other than this Agreement) delivered herewith, from
and after Closing, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that its sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all Liabilities pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement, the contribution of the Company Interests by
Contributors in exchange for the Contribution Consideration or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.09 _Expenses_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
foregoing defense, release, indemnity and hold harmless obligations shall not
apply to, and, except as otherwise set forth in _Section 9.02_ and _Section
12.02_, each Party shall be solely responsible for, all expenses, including
due diligence expenses, incurred by it to enter into, and consummate the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.10 _Survival._

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of Contributors and the Company
Entities in _Article VI_ (other than the Fundamental Representations) shall
survive the Closing for a period of 12 months. The Fundamental Representations
shall survive the Closing for a period of three years. The Public Company
Representation shall survive the Closing for a period of 12 months. The
special warranty in _Section 4.01(b)_ shall survive the Closing for a period
of 12 months. The covenants and agreements of the Parties in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing for a period that is the longer of 12 months and
such periods in accordance with their terms. Subject to the foregoing and as
set forth in _Section 13.10(b)_, the remainder of this Agreement shall
survive the Closing without time limit. Representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration; provided, however, that there shall be no termination of any bona
fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior to its expiration date.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The indemnities in _Section 13.02_ shall terminate as of the termination
date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a
specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to Contributors or the
Partnership, as applicable, on or before such termination date.

 



 

Section 13.11 _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
this _Article XIII_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Indemnitor** " when used in
connection with particular damages shall mean the Person having an obligation
to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such damages pursuant
to this Agreement, and the term " **Indemnitee** " when used in connection
with particular damages shall mean a Person having the right to be indemnified
with respect to such damages pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under this _Article XIII_, an
Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of its claim, including the specific
details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "
**Claim Notice** "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based
upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnitee (a " **Claim** "), the
Indemnitee shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnitee has
actual knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any)
served with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any Indemnitee
to give notice of a Claim as provided in this _Section 13.11_ shall not
relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations under this _Article XIII_ except to
the extent (and only to the extent of such incremental damages incurred) such
failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnitor
to effectively defend against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the
Indemnitors ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnitor shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify
the Indemnitee whether or not it agrees to indemnify and defend the Indemnitee
against such Claim under this _Article XIII_. Such notice from the Indemnitor
shall include Indemnitors reasonable estimate of the costs and expenses
likely to be incurred defending against such Claim. The Indemnitee is
authorized, prior to and during such 30 day period, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnitor and that is not prejudicial to the
Indemnitor.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnitor agrees to indemnify the Indemnitee, it shall have the
right and obligation to diligently defend the Claim and it shall be entitled
to apply the Holdback Amount towards its cost and expense. The Indemnitor
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnitor, the
Indemnitee agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnitor
elects to contest (provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall not be
required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The
Indemnitee may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of
any Claim controlled by the Indemnitor pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 13.11_ and it shall be entitled to apply the Holdback Amount
towards its cost and expense; provided that Indemnitee shall reasonably
participate in the defense of such Claim and shall not unnecessarily duplicate
the efforts by the Indemnitor and its counsel. An Indemnitor shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnitee, in the Indemnitees sole
discretion, settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto that (i) does not result in a final resolution of the
Indemnitees Liability with respect to the Claim (including, in the case of a
settlement, an unconditional written release of the Indemnitee from all
Liabilities in respect of such Claim), (ii) may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnitee (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity) or (iii) includes any non-monetary remedy.

 



 

(e) If the Indemnitor does not agree to indemnify the Indemnitee within the 30
day period specified in _Section 13.11(c)_ or fails to give notice to the
Indemnitee within such 30 day period regarding its election or if the
Indemnitor agrees to indemnify, but fails to diligently defend or settle the
Claim, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to defend against the Claim
and it shall be entitled to apply the Holdback Amount towards its cost and
expense, with counsel of the Indemnitees choosing; provided, however, that
the Indemnitee shall make no settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgment that would give rise to Liability on the part of any Indemnitor
without the prior written consent of such Indemnitor, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnitor shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure
the damages complained of, (ii) agree to indemnify the Indemnitee for such
damages, or (iii) dispute the claim for such damages. If such Indemnitor does
not respond to such Claim Notice within such 30 day period, such Indemnitor
will be deemed to dispute the claim for damages.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the damages (i)
asserted in the Claim, or (ii) when the damages are not asserted in the Claim,
as reasonably estimated by the Indemnitee, in each case together with the
Indemnitees reasonable estimate of the costs and expense of defending the
Claim, exceed the Holdback Amount, then Indemnitor shall permit Indemnitee to
assume the defense of the Claim, or if Indemnitor has already assumed the
defense of the Claim, Indemnitor shall turn over the defense of the Claim to
Indemnitee, in which case the provisions of _Section 13.11(e)_ shall apply.

(iii) The Partnership shall prepare or cause to be prepared all other Tax
Returns of the Company Entities for Pre-Closing Periods (" **Pre-Closing Tax
Returns** "). Such Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis

to any Pre-Closing Tax Return, the Contributors shall pay to the Partnership
the amount of any Taxes with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Return that are
attributable (as determined below) to periods prior to the Balance Sheet Date

December 31, 2010 Balance Sheet or were not taken into account under _Section
9.02(b)(vii)_.

 



 

(iv) The Partnership shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of

(A) In the case of any Tax that is based on income, sales, revenue, production
or similar items, and that pertains or is attributable to any period that

attributable to the period prior to the Balance Sheet Date shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Balance Sheet Date.

(b) Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate fully
with the other Party, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party and at the requesting Partys expense, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns and any proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such proceeding
and making employees (to the extent such employees were responsible for the
preparation, maintenance or interpretation of information and documents
relevant to Tax matters or to the extent required as witnesses in any Tax
proceedings), available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each Party
agrees to retain all of its books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company Entities relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(c) All sales, use or other Taxes (other than taxes on gross income, net

incurred by or imposed with respect to the transfer to the Partnership
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement shall be the responsibility of, and
shall be paid by, the Partnership.

 



 

(d) If the Partnership disposes (directly or indirectly) of all or a portion

other than in connection with a transaction involving all or substantially all
of the Partnerships assets (a " **Cana Disposition** ") within one year of
the Closing, the Partnership shall reimburse each Contributor the amount of
such Contributors Lost Deferral Amount attributable to such Cana Disposition,
unless such Contributor has, at the time of such Cana Disposition, disposed of
a number of Partnership Common Units after the Closing that is equal to or
exceeds the number of Partnership Common Units acquired by such Contributor
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If the Partnership disposes (directly or indirectly) of all or a portion
of the Assets other than the Cana Shale Assets in a taxable sale, transfer or
other disposition other than in connection with a transaction involving all or
substantially all of the Partnerships assets (a " **Non-Cana Asset
Disposition** ") within eighteen months of the Closing, the Partnership shall

 



      
 

 



 

reimburse each Contributor the amount of such Contributors Lost Deferral
Amount with respect to such Non-Cana Asset Disposition, unless such
Contributor has, at the time of such Non-Cana Asset Disposition, disposed of a
number of Partnership Common Units after the Closing that is equal to or
exceeds the number of Partnership Common Units acquired by such Contributor
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The Parties agree that the initial capital account attributable to the
Equity Consideration shall on a per unit basis be an amount that, after any
adjustments to the capital accounts of the unitholders in the Partnership
resulting from (i) any foregone distributions with respect to the Equity
Consideration or (ii) any post Closing payments between the Partnership and
the Contributors pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (including payments
pursuant to _Article XIII_ and _Sections 15.01(d)_ and _(e)_ ), equals the
per unit capital account attributable to a Partnership Common Unit owned by a
public unitholder of the Partnership. Determinations in arriving at such
amount shall be calculated, consistent with the Partnerships past practices.

 



 

(g) If, and to the extent, the Contributors provide the Partnership with
necessary documentation and sufficient authorities to support each of the
following positions, as determined in each case by the Partnerships tax
return preparer, the Partnership and Contributors agree to report the
transaction described in _Section 3.01_ and file all income Tax Returns
consistent with the following:

 



 

(i) Each liability of the Company on the Closing Date shall be treated as a
"qualified liability," as such term in defined is Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-5(a)(6).

 



 

(ii) Contributors may report any gain attributable to the Holdback Cash on the
installment method under Section 453 of the Code.

 



 

(h) For federal income tax purposes, the transaction described in _Section
3.01_ shall be treated as an "assets-over" partnership merger within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i). To the extent that
any Contributor receives Cash Consideration or Holdback Cash, such Contributor
shall be treated as selling its Company Interests to the Partnership in
exchange for such Cash Consideration or Holdback Cash in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4). Any Cash Consideration or Holdback
Cash received by a Contributor shall be allocated to the greatest extent
possible to any profit interests in the Company (within the meaning of Revenue
Procedure 93-27) held by such Contributor, and any excess thereof shall be
allocated to the Contributors other Company Interests, if any. Each such
Contributor hereby consents to treat the transaction as a sale of such Company
Interests pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4) and this
_Section 15.01(h)_.

 



 

Section 15.02 _Filings, Notices and Certain Governmental Approvals_. As soon
as reasonably possible after the Closing, (a) but in no event later than 30
days after the Closing, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to change the name of the Company Entities to remove the words "Crow
Creek" therefrom, and (b) but in no event later than 90 days after such
Closing, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
remove the words "Crow Creek", the related logo and all variations thereof
from the Assets. Promptly after

 



      
 

 



 

Closing, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make
all requisite filings with, and provide the requisite notices to, the
appropriate Governmental Authorities to accomplish all transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. From and after the Closing: (x) neither the
Partnership nor any Company Entity shall object to the formation by one or
more of the executive officers of the Company Entities of one or more entities
with the word "Crow Creek" in their name, and (y) each of the Partnership and
the Company Entities shall provide such consents as may be required in
connection with the formation of such entities in order to permit use of the
word "Crow Creek."

 



 

Section 15.03 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the documents to be executed
pursuant hereto and the exhibits and schedules attached hereto constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter
hereof. Subject to _Section 10.01_, no supplement, amendment, alteration,

Entities and the Partnership will consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any written public statements with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and none of the
Contributors, the Company Entities or the Partnership shall issue any such
press release or make any such written public statement without the prior
consent of the other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that (a) the Partnership
may make any public disclosure required by applicable Law or stock exchange
rule (in which case the Partnership shall use reasonable efforts to advise NGP
and the Contributor Representative and give NGP and the Contributor
Representative an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure prior to
making the disclosure) and (b) NGP and its Affiliates may make any public
disclosure required by applicable Law (in which case NGP shall use reasonable
efforts to advise the Partnership and give the Partnership an opportunity to
comment on the proposed disclosure prior to making the disclosure).

Persons included within the definition of Indemnified Party, Contributor
Indemnitees or the Partnership Indemnitees (and in such cases, only to the
extent expressly provided herein), nothing in this Agreement shall provide any
benefit to any Third Party or entitle any Third Party to any claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties that

distributions and all dividends or distributions of securities not referred to
in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph which are payable in respect of the

noted by the Contributor Representative, NGP or the Partnership to the Escrow
Agent within 30 Business Days after receipt thereof. Failure to inform the

shall be deemed to mean that each Unit Contributor is allocated its pro rata
share of the Unit Escrow Fund, cost, expense or other amount, determined in
accordance with the Unit Contributors relative percentage interests in the
Unit Escrow Fund as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto. The Escrow Parties may

showing such updated pro rata share amounts.

 



 

(d) _Taxes_. The Unit Contributors shall be the owners of the Unit Escrow Fund
for tax purposes and shall be responsible for and shall pay and discharge all
taxes, assessments and governmental charges imposed on or with respect to the
Unit Escrow Fund. The Escrow Parties agree to treat the Unit Escrow Fund as
owned by the Unit Contributors, in all cases to the extent not distributed to
the Partnership pursuant to _Section 4_ hereof, and to file all tax returns
on a basis consistent with such treatment.

 



 

4. _Disbursement of the Escrow Funds_. The Escrow Agent shall dispose of or distribute the Escrow Funds or any portions thereof only in accordance with this _Section 4_.

 



 

(a) _Joint Written Instruction_. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and
directed to make disbursements of the Escrow Funds if a distribution has been
jointly agreed to, in writing, by the Partnership, NGP and the Contributor
Representative. The Escrow Agent shall, promptly upon receipt of such joint
written instructions from the Partnership, NGP and the Contributor
Representative, release the Escrow Funds (or any portions thereof) in
accordance with such joint written instructions. The Partnership, NGP and the
Contributor Representative agree that, where terms of Contribution Agreement
require disbursements in accordance therewith, the Partnership, NGP, and the
Contributor Representative, as applicable, shall use their best efforts in
complying with such terms with respect to a joint written instruction required
hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Court Order_. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to make disbursements
of the Escrow Funds if the Escrow Agent has received a copy of an order of a
court of competent jurisdiction directing the distribution of amounts from the
Escrow Funds, together with a certificate signed by the Partnership, NGP or
the Contributor Representative, as applicable, requesting release of the
Escrow Funds (or any portions thereof) which it (or in the case of the
Contributor Representative, the Contributors other than NGP), is entitled to
receive under the terms of the court order (each an " _Claim Certificate_ "),
and in such a case, the Escrow Agent shall, promptly upon receipt of such
court order and Claim Certificate, release the Escrow Funds (or such portions
thereof) as

      
 

 



 

directed in such court order to the person presenting the Claim Certificate.
In the event that the Escrow Agent complies with any such court order, it
shall not be liable to any of the Partnership, NGP or the Contributor
Representative or to any other person, firm or corporation, as a result of
such compliance notwithstanding that such court order is subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated;

 



 

(c) _12-Month Anniversary_. Subject to receipt of any Claim Notice (defined
below) and the procedures triggered thereby (including the provisions of
_Section 4(e)_, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to make
disbursements of the Escrow Funds automatically and with no further action of
the Parties on the twelve-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the
" _Escrow Termination Date_ "). At such time, (i) the Escrow Agent shall
release to the Contributor Representative (on behalf of Contributors other
than NGP) the then current balance of the Cash Escrow Fund to be distributed
to all of the Contributors (other than NGP) by the Contributor Representative
according to each Contributors pro rata share of the Cash Escrow Fund as
reflected in _Exhibit A_, and (ii) the Escrow Agent shall release to the
Contributor Representative (on behalf of Unit Contributors other than NGP) and
NGP the then current balance of the Unit Escrow Fund, with the amounts
released to the Contributor Representative to be distributed to all of the
Unit Contributors (other than NGP) by the Contributor Representative according
to each such Unit Contributors pro rata share of the Unit Escrow Fund as
reflected in _Exhibit A_, and with respect to Partnership Common Units, in
accordance with the Mechanics of Disbursement of Partnership Common Units
provided in _Section 4(f)_ below for disbursement of any Partnership Common
Units and in accordance with appropriate wiring instructions provided to the
Escrow Agent for any cash disbursements.

 



 

(d) _Payment of Claims_. Once it is determined (by agreement of the Escrow
Parties, court order, or otherwise) that the Partnership (or any other
Partnership Indemnitee, as such term is defined in the Contribution Agreement)
is entitled to receive some or all of the Escrow Funds, the respective amounts
to be disbursed from the Cash Escrow Fund and the Unit Escrow Fund to satisfy
that claim shall be determined as follows: (i) first, (x) the value of the
Unit Escrow Fund shall be determined as of the anticipated disbursement date
using the valuation formula set forth in the Contribution Agreement for the
valuation of Partnership Common Units to be disbursed from the Unit Escrow
Fund and (y) the value of the Cash Escrow Fund shall be determined as of the
anticipated disbursement date, (ii) second, an amount shall be disbursed from
the Unit Escrow Fund equal to the amount of the claim being paid multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the Unit Escrow Fund and
the denominator of which is the sum of the value of the Unit Escrow Fund and
the value of the Cash Escrow Fund, (iii) third, an amount shall be disbursed
from the Cash Escrow Fund equal to the amount of the claim being paid
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the Cash
Escrow Fund and the denominator of which is the sum of the value of the Unit
Escrow Fund and the value of the Cash Escrow Fund, and (iv) if the claim has
still not been fully paid and there is either cash remaining in the Cash
Escrow Fund or Partnership Common Units (or other securities) remaining in the
Unit Escrow Fund, then such remaining cash or securities, as the case may be,
shall be disbursed to the extent necessary

      
 

 



 

to pay the claim. The Partnership, NGP and the Contributor Representative
shall issue joint written instruction for the disbursement of portions of the
Escrow Funds when required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of this
_Section 4(d)_.

 



 

(e) _Effect of Delivery of a Claim Notice. _If, prior to the Escrow
Termination Date, the Partnership has delivered to Escrow Agent, NGP and the
Contributor Representative a certificate stating that the Partnership has a
good faith claim to the Escrow Funds and stating the Partnerships good faith
estimate of the amount of such claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "), then the amount
of the disbursements made under _Section 4(c)_ (12-Month Anniversary) shall
be reduced by the amount of the claim in the Claim Notice. The amount of the
reduction shall be determined by calculating in accordance with _Section
4(d)_ the amount of the Cash Escrow Fund and the amount of the Unit Escrow
Fund that would be used to pay such pending claims if they were paid in full
on the Escrow Termination Date, and subtracting those amounts from the
disbursements made on the Escrow Termination Date. Any amounts not disbursed
on the Escrow Termination Date shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent as soon
as possible after any unresolved claims are finally resolved, or otherwise
pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon resolution of
any such unresolved claims (or any part thereof), the Partnership, NGP and the
Contributor Representative shall issue joint instructions for the release of
any remaining portions of the Escrow Funds that are no longer in dispute in
accordance with _Section 4(a)_ hereof.

 



 

(f) _Mechanics of Disbursement of Partnership Common Units_. The Escrow
Agents sole obligation with respect to the distribution of any Partnership
Common Units shall be to deliver the certificates representing the Partnership
Common Units that comprise the Unit Escrow Fund to the appropriate party or to
deliver such Partnership Common Units to the Partnerships transfer agent
along with appropriate instructions to (a) issue new certificates in the name
of the person or party in the amount of Partnership Common Units such person
or party is entitled to receive and (b) issue new certificates in the name of
the Unit Contributors for the balance of such Partnership Common Units.
Partnership Common Units disbursed to the Partnership (or any other
Partnership Indemnitee) will be deducted from the holdings of each Unit
Contributor on a pro rata basis according to the number of Partnership Common
Units held in the Unit Escrow Fund for the account of such Unit Contributor.
The Escrow Agent shall have no liability in the event of any mistake, delay or
failure to act on the part of Partnerships transfer agent.

 



 

5. _Account Opening Information/Tax Matters_.

 



 

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT.

 



 

(a) For accounts opened in the US: To help the government fight the funding of
terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each
person who

      
 

 



 

opens an account. When an account is opened, the Escrow Agent will ask for
information that will allow it to identify relevant parties.

 



 

(b) Each of the Escrow Parties shall, and the Contributor Representative shall
cause the Contributors (other than NGP) to, provide the Escrow Agent with its
taxpayer identification number using forms reasonably satisfactory to the
Escrow Agent. Failure so to provide such forms may prevent or delay
disbursements from the Escrow Funds and may also result in the assessment of a
penalty and the Escrow Agents being required to withhold tax on any interest
or other income earned on the Escrow Funds. Any payments of income shall be
subject to applicable withholding regulations then in force in the United
States or any other jurisdiction, as applicable.

 



 

6. _Scope of Undertaking_. The Escrow Agents duties and responsibilities in connection with this Agreement shall be purely ministerial and shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Escrow Agent is not a principal, participant or beneficiary in any transaction underlying this Agreement and shall have no duty to inquire beyond the terms and provisions hereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or obligation of any kind in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Funds and shall not be required to deliver the Escrow Funds or any part thereof or take any action with respect to any matters that might arise in connection therewith, other than to receive, hold, invest in money market or similar interest-bearing cash accounts, and deliver the Escrow Funds as herein provided. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is hereby expressly agreed and stipulated by the Escrow Parties that Escrow Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion hereunder and shall have no investment or management responsibility (other than placement of cash proceeds in money market or similar interest-bearing cash accounts) and, accordingly, shall have no duty to, or liability for its failure to, provide investment recommendations or investment advice to the Escrow Parties or any of them. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error in judgment, any act or omission, any mistake of law or fact, or for anything it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except for, subject to _Section 7_ below, its own willful misconduct or gross negligence. It is the intention of the Escrow Parties that the Escrow Agent shall never be required to use, advance or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights and powers hereunder.

 



 

7. _Reliance; Liability_. The Escrow Agent may rely on, and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with, any written notice, instruction or request or other paper furnished to it hereunder or pursuant hereto and believed by it to have been signed or presented by the Escrow Parties. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the Partnership, NGP and the Contributor Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent authorized signers forms in the form of Exhibit C-1, Exhibit C-2 and Exhibit C-3 to this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be responsible for holding and disbursing the Escrow Funds pursuant to this Agreement; _provided, however_ , IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION; _provided, further_ , that the Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss arising from any cause beyond its control,

       
 

 



 

including, but not limited to, the following: (a) acts of God, force majeure,
including, without limitation, war (whether or not declared or existing),
revolution, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, accident, fire, explosion,
stoppage of labor, strikes and other differences with employees; (b) the act,
failure or neglect of any Escrow Party or any agent or correspondent or any
other person selected by the Escrow Agent; (c) any delay, error, omission or
default of any mail, courier, telegraph, cable or wireless agency or operator;
or (d) the acts or edicts of any government or governmental agency or other
group or entity exercising governmental powers; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Escrow Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts which are
consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume
performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances. The
Escrow Agent is not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for the
sufficiency, correctness, genuineness or validity of the subject matter of
this Agreement or any part hereof or for the transaction or transactions
requiring or underlying the execution of this Agreement, the form or execution
hereof or for the identity or authority of any person executing this Agreement
or any part hereof or depositing the Escrow Funds.

 



 

8. _Right of Interpleader_. Should any controversy arise involving the Parties or any of them or any other person, firm or entity with respect to this Agreement or the Escrow Funds, or should a substitute escrow agent fail to be designated as provided in _Section 14_, or if the Escrow Agent should be in doubt as to what action to take, Escrow Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, either (a) to withhold delivery of the Escrow Funds until the controversy is resolved, the conflicting demands are withdrawn or its doubt is resolved or (b) to institute a petition for interpleader in any court of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the Escrow Parties. Should a petition for interpleader be instituted, or should Escrow Agent be threatened with litigation or become involved in litigation in any manner whatsoever in connection with this Agreement or the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Parties hereby jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Escrow Agent for its attorneys fees and any and all other expenses, losses, costs and damages incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with or resulting from such threatened or actual litigation prior to any disbursement hereunder.

 



 

9. _Compensation; Reimbursement of Expenses._ The Escrow Parties hereby agree to pay the Escrow Agent for its services hereunder in accordance with the Escrow Agents fee schedule as attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto, as in effect from time to time, and to pay all expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and enforcement of its rights hereunder and otherwise in connection with the operation, administration and enforcement of this Agreement, including, without limitation, attorneys fees, brokerage costs and related expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent. The Contributor Representative and NGP, on one hand, and the Partnership, on the other, shall each be responsible for one-half of such fees and expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Parties shall be jointly and severally liable to the Escrow Agent for the payment of all such fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary, the Escrow Parties hereby expressly agree that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to charge the Escrow Funds for, and pay and set-off from the Escrow Funds, any and all amounts, if any, then owing to it pursuant to this Agreement prior to the disbursement of the Escrow Funds. To the extent the fees and expenses are paid out of the Escrow Funds and, if not for such fees and expenses, such portion of the Escrow Funds would have been disbursed to the Contributors, the Partnership shall be responsible for reimbursing the Contributor Representative and NGP promptly for their respective share of such fees and expenses. To the extent the fees and 

      
 

 



 

expenses are paid out of the Escrow Funds and, if not for such fees and
expenses, such portion of the Escrow Funds would have been disbursed to the
Partnership, the Contributor Representative and NGP shall be jointly and
severally responsible for reimbursing the Partnership promptly for their share
of such fees and expenses.

 



 

10. _Indemnification_. The Escrow Parties hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and defend the Escrow Agent, its officers, directors, employees and agents (each herein called an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against, and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all losses, liabilities and expenses, including, but not limited to, fees and expenses of outside counsel, court costs, costs, damages and claims, and costs of investigation, litigation and arbitration suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with or arising from or out of (i) the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or (ii) the compliance or attempted compliance by any Indemnified Party with any instruction or direction upon which the Escrow Agent is authorized to rely under this Agreement, except to the extent that any such loss, liability or expense may be finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of an Indemnified Party. **IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENT OF EACH OF THE ESCROW PARTIES TO INDEMNIFY EACH OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FOR, AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS AGAINST, THEIR OWN ACTS OR OMISSIONS OTHER THAN THEIR ACTIONS THAT CONSTITUTE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.**

 ** _SERVICES AGREEMENT_**

 



 

This Services Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
, 2011 (the " _Effective Date_ "), between Crow Creek Operating Company III
L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (" _Provider_ "), and Eagle Rock
Energy GandP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Eagle Rock_ ").

 

 ** **

 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, Natural Gas Partners VIII, L.P. and persons listed as members of CC
Energy II L.L.C. (the " _Contributors_ "), CC Energy II L.L.C. (the "
_Company_ "), Crow Creek Energy II L.L.C. and Crow Creek Operating Company II
L.L.C., and Eagle Rock Energy Partners, L.P. (" _Partnership_ "), are parties
to that certain Membership Interest Contribution Agreement (the "
_Contribution Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Contributors have agreed to
sell to Partnership, and Partnership has agreed to purchase from Contributors,
the ownership interests in the Company, subject to the terms and conditions
therein (the " _Transaction_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the Partnership and Eagle Rock are parties to that certain
Administrative Services Agreement dated July 30, 2010 pursuant to which Eagle
Rock provides certain administrative services to the Partnership and its
subsidiaries; and

 



 

WHEREAS, in order to continue the operation of the Company, its subsidiaries
and certain assets following the consummation of the Transaction, Partnership
has requested Provider to provide certain services to Eagle Rock for a period
following the Closing Date, and Provider has agreed to provide, or cause
certain of its Affiliates to provide, such services, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, Provider and Eagle Rock, in consideration of the mutual
covenants set forth below and for good and valuable consideration, the
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally
bound, do hereby agree as follows:

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE I 
SERVICES**

 



 

1.1 _Definitions_. All capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Contribution Agreement.

 



 

1.2 _Term_. This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and continue
until the Service Period has been reached for each and every Service Provider
(as hereinafter defined), as indicated on the attached Schedule for each
Service Provider (the " _Service Period_ "), unless earlier terminated: (i) in
accordance with any other provision of this Agreement; (ii) by written
agreement of the parties; or (iii) by Eagle Rock, in its sole discretion, upon
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Provider (the " _Term_ ").

      
 

 



 

1.3 _Services_.

 



 

(a) Commencing on the Effective Date and continuing during the Term of this
Agreement, Provider agrees to provide to Eagle Rock, or cause certain of its
Affiliates to provide to Eagle Rock, certain services as requested by Eagle
Rock and described on Schedule A (the " _Services_ ").

 



 

(b) Provider acknowledges and agrees that Eagle Rock has entered into this
Agreement with Provider to retain the same skills, expertise and knowledge
base of the individual Provider employees as designated on the Schedules (the
" _Service Providers_ ") during the Term. The Service Providers who shall
perform Services are identified on the Schedules, which Schedules may be
updated from time-to-time as necessary to reflect the addition or removal of a
Service Provider and as otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. So long
as the Service Providers remain employees of Provider or an Affiliate of
Provider, Provider shall assign the Service Providers to personally perform
the Services, provided that such assignment is consistent with the Schedules.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and, without
limiting or reducing Providers obligations hereunder, Provider shall not be
required or obligated to hire or retain any specific employees, in order to
provide Services under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Provider shall perform, or shall cause its Affiliates to perform, all
Services to the same standard of care, including at substantially the same
response times and accuracy rates, as if they were being performed for
Provider or one of Providers Affiliates and by individuals possessing the
same qualifications as Provider would require if such Services were being
performed for one of Providers Affiliates, but in no event shall (i) such
standard of care be lower than the standard of care applicable in the
industry, and (ii) response times and accuracy rates be materially lower than
applicable industry benchmarks.

 



 

(d) Provider shall provide Eagle Rock, its employees, contractors and
representatives and the Service Providers with access during regular business
hours to any and all Files located at the Tulsa Office Lease, and shall make
such Files available for pick-up by Eagle Rock at its request.

 



 

(e) Eagle Rock shall provide Provider with such information and documentation
as is reasonably requested by Provider; and Eagle Rock shall perform such
actions and tasks as may be reasonably requested by Provider to enable
Provider to perform the Services in accordance with this Agreement. All
Service Providers providing Services and the supervisors of such personnel
will be granted access as Eagle Rock, in good faith determines is appropriate,
to Eagle Rock sites and systems as reasonably necessary or appropriate for
them to fulfill their obligations hereunder. During the Term, Provider shall
ensure that the Service Providers devote sufficient business time as is
necessary and required for the proper performance of the Services. The parties
agree that the Service Providers are employed solely by Provider and shall
perform the Services under the general direction and control of Provider,
consistent with the purposes of this Agreement and the instructions of Eagle
Rock to Provider regarding the nature and timing of the Services and the
identity of the Service Provider who will perform such Services. Accordingly,
Provider acknowledges and agrees that it shall be solely responsible for
paying all wages, providing any and all welfare or pension benefits to and
for, the Service

 



      
 

 



 

Providers and paying all taxes and complying with all Laws with regard to
benefits and tax withholding that relate to the Service Providers.

 



 

(f) Eagle Rock has the right to request that Provider cease having a Service
Provider perform Services under this Agreement at any time, with or without
Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, Eagle Rock shall have Cause to request
that Provider terminate a Service Provider provided by Provider from
performing Services under this Agreement when a Service Provider (i) willfully
and continuously fails to perform the Services (other than by reason of
disability or death) or (ii) fails to meet certain standards of Eagle Rock
relating to the Services, as determined in good faith by Eagle Rock (" _Cause_
").

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE II 
COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR SERVICES**

 



 

2.1 _Fees for Services_. The fee for the Services to be paid by Eagle Rock
(the " _Monthly Fee_ ") shall be determined in accordance with Schedule B.

 



 

2.2 _Completion Bonus_. All Service Providers shall be eligible for a bonus
payment for performing Services under this Agreement (a " _Completion Bonus_
"). The amount of each Service Providers Completion Bonus is indicated on the
Schedules. If a Service Provider is actively performing Services on the date
that the Service Period for that Service Provider is met, Provider shall pay
the Service Provider a one-time, lump sum payment in an amount equal to the
Completion Bonus as indicated on the Service Providers schedule, such amount
to be paid within seven (7) days following the date that the Service Period is
met.

 



 

(a) If a Service Provider is removed from performing Services at Eagle Rocks
request for Cause or ceases to perform Services under this Agreement for any
reason other than death or a disability incurred during the Term, prior to the
date that the Service Period is met for that Service Provider, the Service
Provider shall not be entitled to receive the Completion Bonus.

 



 

(b) If a Service Provider ceases to perform Services under this Agreement due
to death or a disability incurred during the Term or is removed from
performing Services at Eagle Rocks request for any reason other than Cause,
prior to the date that the Service Period is met for that Service Provider,
the Service Provider shall still be entitled to receive the Completion Bonus,
such Completion Bonus to be paid within seven (7) days of the date of
cessation or removal.

 



 

2.3 _Third Party Out-of-Pocket Costs_. All "ordinary" third party out-of-
pocket costs reasonably incurred by Provider in providing the Services under
this Agreement shall be paid by Provider. All "unusual" third party out-of-
pocket costs arising out of requests by Eagle Rock, which shall include
reasonable travel expenses for Provider employees who are requested by Eagle
Rock to travel shall be promptly reimbursed by Eagle Rock to Provider;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any particular expense in excess of $2,000 shall
require the prior written approval of Eagle Rock in order to be eligible for
reimbursement. The determination of whether a third party out-of-pocket cost
is "ordinary" or "unusual" shall be made by both Provider and Eagle Rock, in
good faith.

 



      
 

 



 

2.4 _Payment Terms_. Provider shall provide, within ten (10) days after the
end of each calendar month, for Services rendered in such calendar month (if
any), a written invoice specifying: (i) the Monthly Fee as calculated in
accordance with Schedule B; (ii) the amount of any Completion Bonuses paid
pursuant to Section 2.2, plus an amount equal to the Payroll Taxes (as defined
in Schedule B) paid with respect to any such Completion Bonuses; and (iii) any
"unusual" third party out-of-pocket costs incurred pursuant to Section 2.3,
and Eagle Rock shall pay all undisputed amounts under each such invoice within
thirty (30) days of its receipt of such invoice (any such day on which a
payment amount is due, the " _Due Date_ "). In accordance with Section 2.3, if
it is determined that any "unusual" third party out-of-pocket cost is
"ordinary," rather than "unusual," Eagle Rock shall not be required to pay the
amount of such third party out-of-pocket cost. In any event, if a third party
out-of-pocket cost is in dispute between Provider and Eagle Rock, Eagle Rock
shall not be required to make any payment on such disputed third party out-of-
pocket cost until the dispute is resolved. All payments made pursuant to this
ARTICLE II shall be made in United States Dollars.

 



 

2.5 _Administrative Payments_. Eagle Rock shall pay Provider certain
administrative payments in consideration of Providers performance under this
Agreement (each such payment, an " _Administrative Payment_ "). Each
Administrative Payment is designed to offset certain administrative costs
incurred by Provider in connection with Providers performance under this
Agreement (the " _Administrative Costs_ "). The amount of each Administrative
Payment shall be determined in accordance with this Section 2.5.

 



 

(a) For the first three calendar months of the Term, Provider shall be
entitled to $ per month to offset the Administrative Costs. For
each of the first three calendar months of the Term, Eagle Rock shall pay to
Provider an Administrative Payment in an amount equal to $ within
seven (7) days of the end of each calendar month for the Administrative Costs
incurred during such calendar month.

 



 

(b) For the fourth calendar month of the Term, Provider shall be entitled to $
per month to offset the Administrative Costs. For the fourth calendar month of
the Term, Eagle Rock shall pay to Provider an Administrative Payment in an
amount equal to $ within seven (7) days of the end of the fourth
calendar month for the Administrative Costs incurred during such calendar
month.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE III 
TERMINATION**

 



 

3.1 _Termination_. This Agreement will automatically terminate at the end of
the Term.

 



 

3.2 _Termination for Default_. If:

 



 

(a) A party defaults in the payment of any undisputed indebtedness hereunder
to the other party and fails to remedy such breach within ten (10) business
days of written notice of such default from the non-defaulting party; or

 



 

(b) A party voluntarily files, or involuntarily has filed against it (which
filing is undismissed within sixty (60) days of such involuntary filing), any
bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or reorganization proceeding; or

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If Provider commits a breach of any other provision of this Agreement in
any respect and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) business days
of written notice of such breach from Eagle Rock (or such longer period if a
cure not capable of being completed within such thirty (30) business day
period has been commenced and is being diligently pursued);

 



 

then under (a) and (b), the other party will have the right, in addition to
any other rights and remedies it may have hereunder, to terminate this
Agreement; or under (c), Eagle Rock will have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies it may have hereunder, to terminate this Agreement.

 

 ** **

 

 **ARTICLE IV 
INDEMNITY; INSURANCE**

 



 

4.1 _General Indemnity_. Provider (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Eagle Rock, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), from and
against any and all losses to the extent resulting from any third party claim
based on:

 



 

(a) the breach of this Agreement by the Indemnifying Party;

 



 

(b) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party
related to its performance or obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

4.2 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) Within a reasonable time after receipt by any Indemnified Person of any
third party claim as to which the indemnity provided for in Section 4.1 may
apply, such Indemnified Person shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of such fact; _provided, however_ , a delay in notifying the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations except to the extent that it is materially prejudiced by such
delay.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall diligently, competently and in good faith
control and conduct the defense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person, of any third party claim as to which the indemnity
provided for in Section 4.1 applies; _provided, however_ , the Indemnifying
Party may not settle or compromise any such claim without the Indemnified
Persons consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, unless the terms of such settlement or compromise unconditionally
release the Indemnified Person(s) from any and all liability with respect
thereto and do not impose any obligations on any Indemnified Person.

 



 

(c) An Indemnified Person shall have the right, at its option (but not the
obligation), to be represented by advisory counsel of its own selection and at
its own expense and to monitor the progress and handling of an indemnified
third party claim. An Indemnified Person shall also have the right, at its
option (but not the obligation), to assume the defense of

 



      
 

 



 

any such third party claim with counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost
and expense; _provided, however_ , an Indemnified Person shall have the right
to assume the defense of, and to settle or compromise, any such indemnified
third party claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense if: (i) the Indemnifying
Party fails to acknowledge, in writing, its responsibility to assume the
defense of such third party claim; (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
diligently, competently and in good faith control and conduct the defense of
such third party claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person; (iii) there is an apparent conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person with respect to such third party
claim; or (iv) such Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that
there are legal defenses available to it which are different from, additional
to or inconsistent with those available to the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) Assumption of the defense of a third party claim by the Indemnifying Party
shall not constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of its right to claim
at a later date that such third party claim for which the defense was assumed
is not a proper matter for indemnification pursuant to Section 4.1; _provided,
however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party at any time determines that a third
party claim is not a proper matter for indemnification pursuant to Section
4.1, the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) promptly notify the other party; (ii)
promptly turn over defense of the third party claim and all relevant documents
and information to the third party defendant or its counsel; and (iii)
reasonably cooperate in the transition of such defense to such third party
defendant.

 



 

4.3 _Exclusion of Consequential and Punitive Damages_ **. WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, NEITHER PARTY SHALL,
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM
ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED
HEREUNDER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION LOSSES OR
THIRD PARTY CLAIMS, WHETHER CAUSED BY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE, _PROVIDED_ , _HOWEVER_ , THAT THE FEES FOR SERVICES HEREUNDER AND
PROVIDERS RIGHT THERETO SHALL NOT BE DEEMED INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE IN NATURE.**

 



 

4.4 _Insurance_. As of the date hereof, Provider maintains a general liability
insurance policy (the " _Policy_ ") providing insurance coverage for its
properties and businesses. Provider shall take all actions necessary to cause
Eagle Rock to be insured under the Policy. Should the Policy lapse, expire or
otherwise be cancelled during the Term, Provider shall cause comparable
insurance policies to be in place, each of which such policy shall cause Eagle
Rock to be insured on terms at least as beneficial to Eagle Rock as the terms
of the Policy.

 



 

4.5 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of this
ARTICLE IV shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE V 
CONFIDENTIALITY**

 



 

5.1 Provider undertakes to treat as confidential all information in any medium
or format (whether marked "confidential" or not) which Provider receives
during the Term of this Agreement and for the purposes of this Agreement from
Eagle Rock either directly or from any person, firm, company or organization
associated with Eagle Rock, which concerns the business or operations of Eagle
Rock or its Affiliates or its current or potential customers or current or
potential business partners (" _Confidential Information_ "); provided,
however, (a) Confidential Information shall not include any information which
enters the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this ARTICLE V,
is received from a third party which is under no confidentiality obligations,
or is independently developed by one party without use of the others partys
Confidential Information and (b) all information currently in the Providers
possession which concerns the business or operations of Eagle Rock or its
Affiliates or its current or potential customers or current or potential
business partners and would otherwise meet the requirements of Confidential
Information pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be deemed to be Confidential
Information of Eagle Rock.

 



 

5.2 Provider may also use the Confidential Information of Eagle Rock for the
purposes of this Agreement and Provider may provide its employees, directors,
suppliers, agents, subcontractors and professional advisers with access to
such Confidential Information on a "need-to-know" basis. Provider shall ensure
that its employees, agents and subcontractors comply with its obligations of
confidence. Each separate recipient shall be bound to hold all such
Confidential Information in confidence to the standard required under this
Agreement. Where such recipient is not an employee or director of Provider,
Provider shall provide the Confidential Information to such permitted persons
subject to reasonable and appropriate obligations of confidence.

 



 

5.3 Notwithstanding the other provisions hereof, Provider may disclose
Confidential Information of Eagle Rock where required to do so by law or by
any competent regulatory authority. In these circumstances Provider shall give
Eagle Rock prompt advance written notice of the disclosures so that Eagle Rock
has sufficient opportunity to prevent or control the manner of disclosure by
appropriate legal means.

 



 

5.4 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of this
ARTICLE V shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

assessments and evaluations as the Company may deem necessary. Consultant
agrees to attend such meetings as the Company may require for proper

1.3. _Consulting Relationship._ Consultant shall be an independent contractor
and not an agent or employee of the Company. Neither the relationship of the
Company and Consultant nor any provision of this Agreement shall be construed
to authorize Consultant to take or fail to take any action, make or fail to
make any decision, representation or commitment, binding upon the Company or
any of its affiliated companies in the absence of written specific
authorization executed by an executive officer of the Company. The Company
shall at all times be free to employ other consultants to perform services in
addition to or in lieu of the services to be provided by Consultant. Subject

obligated to devote hereunder to the Company in such manner as Consultant
deems fit and to such persons, firms or corporations as Consultant chooses.

benefit plans, programs, or arrangements of the Company or its parent or
affiliated companies pertaining to, including with limitation, any pension,

insurance, disability, severance or fringe benefits.

 



 

 **2.** ** ****_Compensation._**

 



 

2.1. _Consulting Fee._ As compensation to Consultant for supplying services

accordance with the Companys regular practices for payment of service
providers.

 



 

2.2. _Completion Bonus_. Consultant is eligible for a bonus payment for
completion of services under this Agreement. If Consultant actively provides

.00 (the " **Completion Bonus** "), payable within seven (7) days following
the last day the Consultant provides services to the Company.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company prior to the end of the
Consulting Period for any reason other than Cause as described in Section 3.2,
Consultant shall still be entitled to receive the Completion Bonus, such
Completion Bonus to be paid within seven (7) days of the last day of the
Consulting Period.

terminated by the Company for Cause or by Consultant for any reason,
Consultant shall not be entitled to receive the Completion Bonus.

 



 

2.3. _[End of Period Payment_. At the end of the Consulting Period, regardless
of whether Consultant has continued to provide services to the Company,
Consultant will be entitled to a one-time lump sum payment of $
.00, payable within seven (7) days following the last day of the Consulting
Period.]

 



 

2.4. _No Withholding Obligation._ As an independent contractor of the Company,
Consultant acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Company is not required to
withhold federal or

Consultant hereunder, or to otherwise comply with any state or federal law
concerning the collection of income, gross receipts or similar taxes at the
source of payment of wages, (ii) the Company is not required under the United
States Federal Unemployment Tax Act or the United States Federal Insurance
Contribution Act to pay or withhold taxes for unemployment compensation or for
social security on behalf of Consultant or his or her dependents with respect
to the Consulting Fee and (iii) the Company is not required under the laws of
any state to obtain workers compensation insurance or to make state
unemployment compensation contributions on behalf of Consultant.

3.1. _Term and Termination._ The term of this Agreement shall commence as of
the Effective Date and shall continue in effect for days

Agreement shall automatically terminate upon (1) the death, disability, or
incapacity of Consultant, or (2) expiration of the term without a prior
written extension mutually agreed to by the parties and signed by Consultant

Consultant or the Company may terminate this Agreement at any time for any
reason or no reason. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than

termination.

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the Parties hereby agree as
follows:

      
 

 



 

 **1.** ** ****_Confidential Information._** Contributor agrees and
acknowledges that, because of his/her employment with CC Operating, the
services he/she may provide pursuant to **[the Services Agreement] [the
Consulting Agreement]** , his/her ownership interests in the Company, the

continue to acquire information regarding the Company Entities (as defined in
the Contribution Agreement and referred to hereinafter as the " ** _CC
Group_** ") and the Partnerships and its affiliates trade secrets and/or
proprietary and confidential information, including, but not limited to,
information about acquisitions, assets, contracts, leases, surveys, and plans,
related to the CC Groups and the Partnerships and its affiliates past,
present or anticipated business. Therefore, except as may be required by law,
Contributor will not, at any time, disclose to others, permit to be disclosed,
use, permit to be used, copy or permit to be copied, any trade secrets and/or
proprietary or confidential information acquired (i) during his/her employment
with CC Operating, (ii) during the time that Contributor had an ownership
interest in the Company, (iii) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, (iv) if applicable, during his/her
employment with the Partnership Employer or (v) if applicable, during his/her

agreed that proprietary and confidential information shall exclude (A) any
information publicly available (other than from disclosure by Contributor in
violation of this Agreement); and (B) any information which Contributor is
required to disclose by law or legal process.

 



 

 **2.** ** ****_Noncompetition And Non-solicitation_**. In order to protect
the Partnerships legitimate business interests, including the protection and
preservation of the goodwill that is being contributed by the Contributor to
the Partnership, the Contributor agrees that beginning on the Closing Date, as
such term is defined in the Contribution Agreement, and for one (1) year
thereafter, the Contributor will not, directly or indirectly:

 



 

 **(a)** ** **carry on or engage in (whether as a director, employee, agent,
consultant or otherwise) a Competing Business within the Restricted Area, so
long as the Partnership carries out business therein; or

 



 

 **(b)** ** **solicit (or assist another in soliciting) any employees of the
Partnership or its affiliates (including the Partnership Employer).

 



 

 **(c)** ** **For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

i. " ** _Competing Business_** " means any business concern (other than the
Partnership) that engages in, or is planning to engage in, any activity
related to the acquisition or sale of oil and gas properties, or any drilling
or other development, operations or marketing activities relating to oil and
gas properties.

 



 

ii. " ** _Restricted Area_** " means any area in Texas or Arkansas that is
within one mile of any properties acquired by the Partnership pursuant to this
Contribution Agreement. The Contributor expressly

 



      
 

 



 

acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership carries out its business
throughout the Restricted Area.

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****_Reasonableness of Restrictions_**. The Contributor
understands and acknowledges that significant goodwill is being conveyed by
him/her through the Contribution Agreement and that such goodwill is worthy of
protection and that the Partnerships need for the protection afforded by this
Agreement is greater than any hardship the Contributor might experience by
complying with its terms. The Contributor agrees that the limitations as to
time, geographic area, and scope of activity to be restrained contained in
this Agreement are reasonable and are not greater than necessary to protect
the goodwill that is being conveyed to the Partnership.

 



 

 **(e)** ** ****_Acquisitions_**. During the time period within which
Contributors activities are restricted pursuant Section 2(a) above,
Contributor (acting individually or through a Competing Business) may desire
to acquire one or more packages of oil and gas properties (each a " **
_Package_** ") which include oil and gas properties inside and outside the
Restricted Area. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(a), no
acquisition of a Package or any drilling or other development, operations or
marketing activities relating to the oil and gas properties included therein
shall constitute a violation of Section 2(a) so long as the amount of purchase
price reasonably allocated to such oil and gas properties that are inside the
Restricted Area constitutes less than fifteen percent (15%) of the acquisition
price of the entire Package.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****_Right to Injunction_**. The Contributor acknowledges that
his/her violation or threatened or attempted violation of the covenants
contained in this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to the Partnership and
that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement. The Contributor agrees that the Partnership shall be entitled as a
matter of right to specific performance of the covenants in this Agreement,
including entry of an _ex parte_ temporary restraining order in state or
federal court, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against activities
in violation of this Agreement, or both, or other appropriate judicial remedy,
writ or order, in any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any
violation or further violation of such agreements by the Contributor or others
acting on the Contributors behalf, without any showing of irreparable harm
and without any showing that the Partnership does not have an adequate remedy
at law. In this connection, the Contributor covenants and warrants that he/she
will not dispute in any proceeding that any given violation or further
violation of the covenants contained herein: (a) will result in irreparable
harm to the Partnership or (b) could not be remedied adequately at law. The
Partnerships right to injunctive relief shall be cumulative and in addition
to any other remedies provided by law or equity, including the recovery of
damages, attorneys fees, costs and expenses.

 



 

 **4.** ** ****_Miscellaneous_**.

 



 

 **(a)** ** ****_Modification_**. No Party has the authority to modify or
amend this Agreement unless the modification or amendment is in writing and
signed by each Party hereto.

 



      
 

 



 

 **(b)** ** ****_Severability_**. If any term, provision, covenant or
condition of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, invalid, unenforceable or void, the validity and enforceability of
the remainder of this Agreement and the Contribution Agreement shall not in
any way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 



 

 **(c)** ** ****_Waiver_**. Any waiver of any term of this Agreement by the
Partnership shall not operate as a waiver of any other term of this Agreement,
nor shall any failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement operate as a
waiver of the Partnerships right to enforce any other provision of this
Agreement. Further, the Partnerships non-action with respect to the breach of
this or a similar agreement by any other party or entity will not constitute a
wavier of the Partnerships right to enforce any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

 **(d)** ** ****_Attorney s Fees_**. In the event of any legal action
concerning this Agreement, the Partnership shall be entitled to recover any
and all reasonable costs and attorneys fees incurred in prosecuting or
defending against such action, if the Partnership is the prevailing party.

 



 

 **(e)** ** ****_Proper Construction_**. The language of all parts of this
Agreement shall in all cases be deemed to be the language chosen by the
Parties to express their mutual intent and shall be construed as a whole
according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the
Parties. Moreover, the paragraph headings used in this Agreement are intended
solely for convenience of reference and shall not in any manner amplify,
limit, modify or otherwise be used in the interpretation of any of the
provisions hereof.

 



 

 **(f)** ** ****_Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts (including facsimile or electronic counterparts), each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together will
constitute one and the same Agreement.

 



 

 **(g)** ** ****_Termination_**. In the event that the Contribution Agreement
is terminated prior to the Closing in accordance with its terms, this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate and be of no force or effect.

 



 

 **5.** ** ****_Choice of Law_**. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Texas,
without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

include any Partnership Securities for which Rule 144 of the Securities Act or
another exemption from registration is available to enable the holder of
Partnership Securities to dispose of the number of Partnership Securities it
desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under the
Securities Act or other similar applicable law (and without any limitation on
volume, timing, recipients or intended method or methods of distribution,
including through the use of an underwriter, that would not be applicable with
a Registration Statement). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) where this
Agreement refers to a minimum number of Registrable Securities necessary for a
matter to occur or to be permitted, such minimum number of Registrable
Securities shall be determined considering the applicable Warrants (if any) on
an as-converted basis and (ii) where this Agreement refers to allocation of
rights on a pro rata basis to holders of Partnership Securities, such
allocation shall be determined considering the applicable Warrants (if any) on
an as-converted basis.

Registration_** ").

Partnership shall give written notice of such Demand Notice to all Holders and
shall, subject to the limitations of this Section 2(a), file a Registration
Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities that the Holders shall in
writing request (such request to be given to the Partnership within three (3)
days of receipt of such notice of the Demand Notice given by the Partnership
pursuant to this Section 2(a)(ii)) to be included in such Demand Registration

Partnership is not obligated hereunder to effect more than (A) one (1) Demand
Registration in any twelve (12) month period and (B) a total of four (4)
Demand Registrations pursuant to this Agreement; _provided however_ , that if
Section 7.12 of the LP Agreement is amended and NGP VIII and/or any of its
Affiliates had registration rights under such section immediately prior to

Agreement shall be increased to seven (7) less any demand registrations
effected on behalf of NGP VIII and/or any of its Affiliates pursuant to

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2(a), the Partnership
shall not be required to: (A) file a Registration Statement pursuant to this
Section 2(a) during the period starting with the date thirty (30) days prior
to a good faith estimate by the General Partner, of the date of filing of, and
ending on a date ninety (90) days after the effective date of, a Partnership
initiated registration; provided that the Partnership is actively employing
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective; (B) effect a registration or file a Registration Statement for a
period of up to one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of a Demand
Notice for registration pursuant to this Section 2(a) if at the time of such
request (1) the Partnership is engaged, or has plans to engage, within thirty
(30) days of the time of such Demand Notice, in a firm commitment underwritten
public offering of Common Units), or (2) the Partnership is currently engaged
in a self-tender or exchange offer and the filing of a Registration Statement
would cause a violation of the Exchange Act; or (C) effect a registration or
file a Registration Statement for a period of up to ninety (90) days, if (1)
the General Partner determines that a postponement is in the best interest of
the Partnership and its Limited Partners generally due to a pending
transaction involving the Partnership, (2) the General Partner determines such
registration would render the Partnership unable to comply with applicable
securities laws or (3) the General Partner determines such registration would
require premature disclosure of material information that the Partnership has
a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential (any such period,
a " ** _Suspension Period_** "); _provided, however_ , that (i) in no event
shall the Partnership postpone or defer any Demand Registration pursuant to
this Section 2(a)(iv) and/or Section 7(g) for more than an aggregate of one
hundred twenty (120) days in any twelve (12) month period, (ii) in the event
the Partnership postpones or defers any Demand Registration pursuant to
Section 2(a)(iv)(C)(2) or (3), then during such Suspension Period, the
Partnership shall not engage in any transaction involving the offer, issuance,
sale, or purchase of Partnership Securities (whether for the benefit of the
Partnership or a third Person), except transactions involving the issuance or
purchase of Partnership Securities as contemplated by Partnership employee
benefit plans or employee or director arrangements or the Warrants, and (iii)
in the event the Partnership postpones or defers any Demand Registration
pursuant to Section 2(a)(iv)(C)(1), then during such Suspension Period, the
Partnership shall (to the extent it has the contractual right) not permit any
other holder of registration rights to effect a registration or file a
registration statement.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2(a), if (A) the
Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by a Demand
Registration

 



      
 

 



 

by means of an underwriting and (B) the managing underwriter advises the
Partnership that the inclusion of all of the Holders Registrable Securities
in the subject Registration Statement would likely have an adverse effect in
any material respect on the price, timing or distribution of the Partnership
Securities proposed to be included in such offering or the market for the
Common Units, then the Partnership shall so advise all Holders of Registrable
Securities that would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the
number of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting
shall, subject to any preferential rights to be included pursuant to the Pre-
Existing Rights, be allocated to the Holders of such Registrable Securities on
a pro rata basis based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all
such Holders (including the Initiating Holders). Any Registrable Securities
excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from the
registration. In the event that the managing underwriter limits the number of
Registrable Securities to be included in the Registration Statement pursuant
to this Section 2(a)(v), unless at least the lesser of 80% of the aggregate
Registrable Securities set forth in such Holders written requests pursuant to
Section 2(a)(ii) and Registrable Securities(4) are included in the
subject Registration Statement, such Demand Registration shall not be
considered for purposes of the limitations set forth in Section 2(a)(iii).

 



 

(vi) The Partnership may include in any such Demand Registration other
Partnership Securities for sale for its own account or for the account of any
other Person; _provided_ that if the managing underwriter for the offering
determines that the number of Partnership Securities proposed to be offered in
such offering would likely have an adverse effect in any material respect on
the price, timing or distribution of the Partnership Securities proposed to be
included in such offering or the market for the Common Units, then, subject to
any Pre-Existing Rights, the Registrable Securities to be sold by the Holders
shall be included in such registration before any Partnership Securities
proposed to be sold for the account of the Partnership or any other Person.

 



 

(vii) Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, the Partnership
shall effect any Demand Registration on Form S-3 (except if the Partnership is
not then eligible to register for resale the Registrable Securities on Form
S-3, in which case such Demand Registration shall be effected on another
appropriate form for such purpose pursuant to the Securities Act) and if the
Partnership becomes, and is at the time of its receipt of a Demand Notice, a
WKSI, the Demand Registration for any offering and selling of Registrable
Securities through a firm commitment underwriting shall be effected pursuant
to an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, which shall be on Form S-3 or
any equivalent or successor form under the Securities Act (if available to the
Partnership); _provided_ , _however_ , that if at any time a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 is effective and a Holder provides written notice to the
Partnership that it intends to effect an offering of all or part of the
Registrable Securities included on such Registration Statement, the
Partnership will amend or supplement such Registration Statement as may be
necessary in order to enable such offering to take place.

  (4) Will fill in with a number that represents 1/4 of total Registrable
Securities as of the closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) Without limiting Section 3, in connection with any Demand Registration
pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 2(a), the Partnership shall,
(A) promptly prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed (1) such
additional forms, amendments, supplements, prospectuses, certificates,
letters, opinions and other documents, as may be necessary or advisable to
register or qualify the securities subject to such Demand Registration,
including under the securities laws of such states as the Holders shall
reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such qualification shall
be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership
would become subject to general service of process or to taxation or
qualification to do business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of
registration and (2) such forms, amendments, supplements, prospectuses,
certificates, letters, opinions and other documents as may be necessary to
apply for listing or to list the Registrable Securities subject to such Demand
Registration on the Trading Market and (B) do any and all other acts and
things that may be necessary or appropriate or reasonably requested by the
Holders to enable the Holders to consummate a public sale of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended timing and method or methods of
distribution thereof.

 



 

(ix) In the event a Holder transfers Registrable Securities included on a
Registration Statement and such Registrable Securities remain Registrable
Securities following such transfer, at the request of such Holder, the
Partnership shall amend or supplement such Registration Statement as may be
necessary in order to enable such transferee to offer and sell such
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement; provided that
in no event shall the Partnership be required to file a post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement unless (A) such Registration Statement
includes only Registrable Securities held by the Holder, Affiliates of the
Holder or transferees of the Holder or (B) the Partnership has received a
written consent therefor from every Person for whom Partnership Securities
have been registered on (but not yet sold under) such Registration Statement,
other than the Holder, Affiliates of the Holder or transferees of the Holder.

 



 

(b) _Piggyback Registration_.

 



 

(i) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a Registration
Statement, other than pursuant to any Demand Registration, for an offering of
Partnership Securities for cash (whether in connection with a public offering
of Partnership Securities by the Partnership, a public offering of Partnership
Securities by unitholders, or both, but excluding an offering relating solely
to an employee benefit plan, an offering relating to a transaction on Form S-4
or an offering on any registration statement form that does not permit
secondary sales), the Partnership shall promptly notify all Holders of such
proposal reasonably in advance of (and in any event at least two (2) Trading
Days before) the anticipated filing date (the " ** _Piggyback Notice_** ").
The Piggyback Notice shall offer the Holders the opportunity to include for
registration in such Registration Statement the number of Registrable
Securities as they may request (a " ** _Piggyback Registration_** "). The
Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to include in each such
Piggyback Registration such Registrable Securities for which the Partnership
has received written requests within three (3) days after mailing of the
Piggyback Notice (" ** _Piggyback Request_** ") for inclusion therein. If a
Holder decides not to include all of its Registrable Securities in any
Registration Statement thereafter filed by the Partnership, such Holder

 



      
 

 



 

shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include any Registrable
Securities in any subsequent registration statement or registration statements
as may be filed by the Partnership with respect to offerings of Partnership
Securities, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



 

(ii) If the Registration Statement under which the Partnership gives notice
under this Section 2(b) is for an underwritten offering, the Partnership shall
so advise the Holders of Registrable Securities. In such event, the right of
any such Holder to be included in a registration pursuant to this Section 2(b)
shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such underwriting and
the inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in the underwriting to
the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their
Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters
selected for such underwriting by the Partnership. If the managing underwriter
or managing underwriters of such offering advise the Partnership and the
Holders in writing that in their reasonable opinion that the inclusion of all
of the Holders Registrable Securities in the subject Registration Statement
(or any other Partnership Securities proposed to be included in such offering)
would likely have an adverse effect in any material respect on the price,
timing or distribution of the Partnership Securities proposed to be included
in such offering or the market for the Common Units, the Partnership shall
include in such offering only that number or amount, if any, of Partnership
Securities proposed to be included in such offering that, in the reasonable
opinion of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, will not have
such effect, with such number to be allocated, subject to the rights of any
holder that has priority by virtue of any Pre-Existing Rights, as follows: (i)
first, to the Partnership or the Person or Persons demanding such underwritten
Offering and (ii) if there remains availability for additional Partnership
Securities to be included in such registration, second pro-rata among all
Holders desiring to register Registrable Securities and all other holders of
Partnership Securities who may be seeking to register such Partnership
Securities based on the number of Partnership Securities such Holder or holder
is entitled to include in such registration. If any Holder disapproves of the
terms of any such underwriting, such Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by
written notice to the Partnership and the managing underwriter(s) delivered on
or prior to the time of pricing of such offering. Any Registrable Securities
withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the
registration.

 



 

(iii) The Partnership shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any
registration initiated by it under this Section 2(b) prior to the Effective
Date of such Registration Statement whether or not any Holder has elected to
include Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement. The
registration expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the
Partnership in accordance with Section 4 hereof.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 2(a)(iii), all registration rights granted under this
Section 2 shall continue to be applicable with respect to any Holder for so
long as may be required for each such Holder to sell all of the Registrable
Securities held by such Holder (without any limitation on volume, timing,
recipients or intended method or methods of distribution, including through
the use of an underwriter, that would not be applicable with a registration
under the Securities Act).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Any Demand Notice or Piggyback Request shall (i) specify the Registrable
Securities intended to be offered and sold by the Holder making the request,
(ii) express such Holders present intent to offer such Registrable Securities
for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or method of the proposed offer
and sale of Registrable Securities and (iv) contain the undertaking of such
Holder to provide all such information and materials and take all action as
may reasonably be required in order to permit the Partnership to comply with
all applicable requirements in connection with the registration of such
Registrable Securities.

 



 

(e) No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining
or otherwise delaying any such registration as the result of any controversy
that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this
Section 2.

 



 

(f) The Holders hereby acknowledge that the Registration Rights Agreements and
Section 7.12 of the LP Agreement grant certain registration rights (the " **
_Pre-Existing Rights_** ") to the Persons referred to therein and that the
Pre-Existing Rights may be inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders
with respect to Registrable Securities in this Agreement and may otherwise
conflict with the provisions hereof. Any rights of the Holders hereunder and
any obligations of the Partnership hereunder shall be limited and
appropriately modified to the extent that such rights or obligations conflict
with the exercise of the Pre-Existing Rights by any holder(s) thereof. The
Partnership hereby acknowledges that the exercise of any right granted to
Holders hereunder shall not constitute an exercise of any Pre-Existing Rights
by such Holder. The Partnership will not enter into any agreement during the
term of this Agreement which would allow any holder of Partnership Securities
to include Partnership Securities in any Registration Statement filed by the
Partnership in a manner that would violate in any material respect the rights
granted to the Holders hereunder.

 



 

3. **_Registration Procedures_** **.**

 



 

The procedures to be followed by the Partnership and each Holder electing to
sell Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement pursuant to this
Agreement, and the respective rights and obligations of the Partnership and
such Holders, with respect to the preparation, filing and effectiveness of
such Registration Statement, are as follows:

 



 

(a) The Partnership will, at least three (3) days prior to the anticipated
filing of a Registration Statement or any related Prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto (other than amendments and supplements that do nothing
more than name Holders and provide information with respect thereto), (i)
unless available to the Holders through public filings with the Commission,
furnish to such Holders copies of all such documents proposed to be filed and
(ii) use its reasonable efforts to address in each such document when so filed
with the Commission such comments as such Holders reasonably shall propose
within two (2) days of the delivery of such copies to the Holders.

 



 

(b) The Partnership will use commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as
reasonably possible (i) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments,
including post-effective amendments, and supplements to each Registration
Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary
under applicable law to keep such Registration Statement continuously
effective with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities
covered thereby for its Effectiveness Period and, subject to the limitations
contained in this

 



       
 

 



 

Agreement, prepare and file with the Commission such additional Registration
Statements in order to register for resale under the Securities Act all of the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders; (ii) cause the related Prospectus
to be amended or supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so
supplemented or amended to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; and (iii) respond to
any comments received from the Commission with respect to each Registration
Statement or any amendment thereto and, as promptly as reasonably possible
provide such Holders true and complete copies of all correspondence from and
to the Commission relating to such Registration Statement that pertains to
such Holders as selling Holders but not any comments that would result in the
disclosure to such Holders of material and non-public information concerning
the Partnership.

 



 

(c) The Partnership will comply in all material respects with the provisions
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the Registration
Statements and the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by each
Registration Statement.

 



 

(d) The Partnership will notify such Holders as promptly as reasonably
practicable: (i)(A) when a Prospectus or any prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendment to a Registration Statement is proposed to be filed; (B)
when the Commission notifies the Partnership whether there will be a " **
_review_** " of such Registration Statement and whenever the Commission
comments in writing on such Registration Statement (in which case the
Partnership shall provide true and complete copies thereof and all written
responses thereto to each of such Holders that pertain to such Holders as
selling Holders, but not information which the Partnership believes would
constitute material and non-public information); and (C) with respect to each
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, when the same
has been declared effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission or any
other federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to
a Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information that
pertains to such Holders as sellers of Registrable Securities; (iii) of the
issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or
the initiation of any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the
Partnership of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of
any Proceeding for such purpose; and (v) of the occurrence of (but not the
nature or details concerning) any event or passage of time that makes any
statement made in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any
material respect or that requires any revisions to such Registration
Statement, Prospectus or other documents so that, in the case of such
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading ( _provided, however_ , that no notice by the Partnership shall be
required pursuant to this clause (v) in the event that the Partnership either
promptly files a prospectus supplement to update the Prospectus or a Form 8-K
or other appropriate Exchange Act report that is incorporated by reference
into the Registration Statement, which in either case, contains the requisite
information that results in such Registration Statement no longer containing
any untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The Partnership will use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the
issuance of, or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order suspending
the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of the
qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment,
or if any such order or suspension is made effective during any Suspension
Period, at the earliest practicable moment after the Suspension Period is
over.

 



 

(f) During the Effectiveness Period, the Partnership will furnish to each such
Holder, without charge, at least one conformed copy of each Registration
Statement and each amendment thereto and all exhibits to the extent requested
by such Holder (including those incorporated by reference) promptly after the
filing of such documents with the Commission; _provided_ , that the
Partnership will not have any obligation to provide any document pursuant to
this clause that is available on the Commissions EDGAR system.

 



 

(g) The Partnership will promptly deliver to each Holder, without charge, as
many copies of each Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of
prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Holder may
reasonably request during the Effectiveness Period. The Partnership consents
to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each
of the selling Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or
supplement thereto.

 



 

(h) The Partnership will cooperate with such Holders to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities
to be delivered to a transferee pursuant to a Registration Statement, which
certificates shall be free of all restrictive legends indicating that the
Registrable Securities are unregistered or unqualified for resale under the
Securities Act, Exchange Act or other applicable securities laws, and to
enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered
in such names as any such Holder may request in writing. In connection
therewith, if required by the Partnerships transfer agent, the Partnership
will promptly, after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement, cause
an opinion of counsel as to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement to
be delivered to and maintained with its transfer agent, together with any
other authorizations, certificates and directions required by the transfer
agent which authorize and direct the transfer agent to issue such Registrable
Securities without any such legend upon sale by the Holder of such Registrable
Securities under the Registration Statement.

 



 

(i) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(d)(v), subject
to Section 2(a)(iv), as promptly as reasonably possible, the Partnership will
prepare a supplement or amendment, including a post-effective amendment, if
required by applicable law, to the affected Registration Statement or a
supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to
be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so
that, as thereafter delivered, no Registration Statement nor any Prospectus
will contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 



 

(j) Such Holders may distribute the Registrable Securities by means of an
underwritten offering; _provided_ that (i) such Holders provide written notice
to the Partnership of

 



      
 

 



 

their intention to distribute Registrable Securities by means of an
underwritten offering, (ii) the right of any Holder to include such Holders
Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such
Holders participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holders
Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein,
(iii) the managing underwriter or managing underwriters thereof shall be
designated by the Initiating Holder in the case of a Demand Registration (
_provided_ , _however_ , that such designated managing underwriter or managing
underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Partnership) or by the
Partnership in the case of a registration initiated by the Partnership, (iv)
each Holder participating in such underwritten offering agrees to enter into
an underwriting agreement in customary form and sell such Holders Registrable
Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Persons entitled to select the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters hereunder and (v) each Holder participating in such underwritten
offering completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required
under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. The Partnership hereby
agrees with each Holder that, in connection with any underwritten offering in
accordance with the terms hereof, it will negotiate in good faith and execute
all indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements, including using
all commercially reasonable efforts to procure customary legal opinions and
auditor "comfort" letters.

 



 

(k) In the event such Holders seek to complete an underwritten offering, for a
reasonable period prior to the filing of any Registration Statement and
throughout the Effectiveness Period, the Partnership will make available upon
reasonable notice at the Partnerships principal place of business or such
other reasonable place for inspection by the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters selected in accordance with Section 3(j) such financial and other
information and books and records of the Partnership, and cause the officers,
employees, counsel and independent certified public accountants of the
Partnership to respond to such inquiries, as shall be reasonably necessary
(and in the case of counsel, not violate an attorney-client privilege in such
counsels reasonable belief) to conduct a reasonable investigation within the
meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act.

 



 

(l) In connection with any registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to
this Agreement, the Partnership will take all commercially reasonable actions
as are necessary or advisable in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of Registrable Securities by such Holders, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause appropriate officers and employees to
be available, on a customary basis and upon reasonable notice, to meet with
prospective investors in presentations, meetings and road shows.

 



 

4. **_Registration Expenses_** **. **All Registration Expenses incident to the Parties performance of or compliance with their respective obligations under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with any Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration (excluding any Selling Expenses) shall be borne by the Partnership, whether or not any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a Registration Statement. " ** _Registration Expenses_** " shall include, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including fees and expenses (A) with respect to filings required to be made with the Trading Market and (B) in compliance with applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws), (ii) printing expenses (including expenses of printing certificates for Partnership Securities and of printing prospectuses if the printing of prospectuses is

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably requested by a Holder of Registrable Securities included in the
Registration Statement), (iii) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses,
(iv) fees and disbursements of counsel, auditors and accountants for the
Partnership, (v) Securities Act liability insurance, if the Partnership so
desires such insurance and (vi) fees and expenses of all other Persons
retained by the Partnership in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, the Partnership
shall be responsible for all of its expenses incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
expenses payable to third parties and including all salaries and expenses of
their officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the
expense of any annual audit and the fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the listing of the Registrable Securities on the Trading Market.

 



 

5. **_Indemnification_** **. **If requested by a Holder, the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless each underwriter, if any, engaged in connection with any registration referred to in Section 2 and provide representations, covenants, opinions and other assurances to any underwriter in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriter and the Partnership. Further, the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers and directors and any Person who controls any such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and any agent thereof (collectively, " ** _Indemnified Persons_** "), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, costs (including reasonable costs of preparation and reasonable attorneys fees) and expenses, judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act or otherwise (collectively, " ** _Losses_** "), as incurred, arising out of or relating to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which any Registrable Securities were registered, in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the Effective Date of such Registration Statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Partnership is required to keep the Registration Statement current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership shall not be liable to any Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of, is based upon or results from an untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person specifically for use in the preparation thereof. The Partnership shall notify the Holders promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any Proceeding of which the Partnership is aware in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Section 5 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely.

 



 

6. **_Facilitation of Sales Pursuant to Rule 144_** **.** To the extent it shall be required to do so under the Exchange Act, the Partnership shall timely file the reports required to be filed by

 



      
 

 



 

it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (including the reports under
Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act referred to in subparagraph (c)(1)
of Rule 144), and shall take such further action as any Holder may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable the Holders to
sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitations of the exemption provided by Rule 144. Upon the request
of any Holder in connection with that Holders sale pursuant to Rule 144, the
Partnership shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

 



 

 **7.** ** ****_Miscellaneous_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Remedies_. In the event of a breach by the Partnership of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, each Holder, in addition to being entitled
to exercise all rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including
recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights
under this Agreement. The Partnership agrees that monetary damages would not
provide adequate compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by
it of any of the provisions of this Agreement and further agrees that, in the
event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it
shall waive the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

 



 

(b) _Discontinued Disposition_. Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of such
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Partnership of
the occurrence of any event of the kind described in clauses (ii) through (v)
of Section 3(d), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such
Registrable Securities under the Registration Statement until such Holders
receipt of the copies of the supplemental Prospectus or amended Registration
Statement or until it is advised in writing by the Partnership that the use of
the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration
Statement. The Partnership may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the
provisions of this Section 7(b).

 



 

(c) _Amendments and Waivers_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or
amended except in a written instrument signed by the Partnership and Holders
that hold a majority of the Registrable Securities as of the date of such
waiver or amendment. The Partnership shall provide prior notice to all Holders
of any proposed waiver or amendment. No waiver of any default with respect to
any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to
be a continuing waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or
a waiver of any other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall
any delay or omission of any Party to exercise any right hereunder in any
manner impair the exercise of any such right.

 



 

(d) _Notices_. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing and shall
be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (i) the date of transmission,

(e) _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their heirs, executors,
administrators, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Except as provided in this Section 7(e), this Agreement, and any rights or
obligations hereunder, may not be assigned without the prior written consent
of the Partnership and NGP VIII. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to
the contrary, the registration rights of a Holder pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to all or any portion of its Registrable Securities may be
assigned without such consent (but only with all related obligations) with
respect to such Registrable Securities (and any Registrable Securities issued
as a dividend or other distribution with respect to, in exchange for or in
replacement of such Registrable Securities) by such Holder to a transferee of
such Registrable Securities; _provided_ (i) that such transferee is an
Affiliate of NGP VIII or such transferee receives in such transfer at least
(5) of the Common Units constituting Registrable Securities or at least
of the Warrants constituting Registrable Securities, (ii) the Partnership is,
within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of
the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the Registrable
Securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned
and (iii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and
subject to the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Partnership may not
assign its respective rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
written consent of NGP VIII.

  (5) Will fill in a number equal to 25% of the outstanding Registrable
Securities as of closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than the Holders (other than NGP VIII),
there are no third party beneficiaries having rights under or with respect to
this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _"Market Stand-Off" Agreement_. In connection with any underwritten
offering of Partnership Securities, each Holder holding five percent (5%) or
more of the Partnerships voting securities (each a " **5% Holder** ") ****
hereby agrees that such Holder shall not sell, transfer, make any short sale
of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar
transaction with the same economic effect as a sale of, any Partnership
Securities held by such Holder (other than those included in such offering)
for a period specified by the representative of the underwriters of
Partnership Securities not to exceed ninety (90) days following the closing
date of the offering of Partnership Securities (the " ** _Stand-Off Period_**
"); _provided_ that all officers and directors of the General Partner and
holders of at least five percent (5%) of the Partnerships voting securities
enter into similar agreements and only if such Persons remain subject thereto
(and are not released from such agreement) for such Stand-Off Period. Each 5%
Holder agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be
reasonably requested by the Partnership or the underwriter which are
consistent with the foregoing or which are necessary to give further effect
thereto. In addition, if requested by the Partnership or the representative of
the underwriters of Partnership Securities, each Holder shall provide, within
three (3) days of such request, such information as may be required by the
Partnership or such representative in connection with the completion of any
public offering of the Partnership Securities pursuant to a Registration
Statement. The obligations described in this Section 7(g) shall not apply to a
registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8
or similar forms that may be promulgated in the future, or a registration
relating solely to a transaction on Form S-4 or similar forms that may be
promulgated in the future. The Partnership may impose stop-transfer
instructions with respect to Common Units (or other securities) subject to the
foregoing restriction until the end of the Stand-Off Period.

 



 

(h) _Execution and Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
Agreement. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile or
electronic mail transmission, such signature shall create a valid binding
obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is
executed) the same with the same force and effect as if such signature
delivered by facsimile or electronic mail transmission were the original
thereof.

 



 

(i) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the
principles of conflicts of law.

 



 

(j) _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from and thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or for the recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Delaware court or, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, in such federal court. The Parties agree that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) _Waiver of Venue_. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (i) any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in
Section 7(j) and (ii) the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

 



 

(l) _Cumulative Remedies_. The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

 



 

(m) _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the Parties shall use
their reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve
the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term,
provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to
be the intention of the Parties that they would have executed the remaining
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such
that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

 



 

(n) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the other Transaction
Documents, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior contracts or agreements with
respect to the subject matter hereof and the matters addressed or governed
hereby or in the other Transaction Documents, whether oral or written.

 **VOTING AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Voting Agreement (this " **Agreement** ") is entered into as of
, 2011 by and among Natural Gas Partners VIII, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (" **NGP VIII** "), and Eagle Rock Energy Partners, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership (the " **Partnership** " and collectively, with
NGP VIII and any other NGP VIII Party, the " **Parties** "). Certain
capitalized and other terms used in this Agreement are defined on _Schedule A_
hereto.

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties, along with certain other Persons, have entered into that
certain Membership Interest Contribution Agreement dated as of ,
2011 (" **Contribution Agreement** ") pursuant to which the Partnership has
issued on the date hereof Common Units (the " **Issued
Securities** ") to NGP VIII; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties entering into this Agreement is a condition to the
Partnerships obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Contribution Agreement;

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 



 

 **SECTION 1.** ** ****VOTING PROVISIONS**

 



 

Section 1.1 **Voting of Partnership Securities**. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the power of attorney and proxy granted in Section 1.5 hereof shall
be used to vote all Subject Securities Beneficially Owned by any NGP VIII
Party for, against or to abstain (or consent) on all matters submitted to a
vote of Voting Securities, either (a) in the case of a vote on a matter at a
unitholders meeting, in the same proportion as the votes are cast by holders
of all Other Voting Securities on such matter at such meeting "for", "against"
or "abstain" (provided, that if, for purposes of such matter, (1) "broker non-
votes" have the effect of votes against such matter, such "broker non-votes"
shall be considered votes against such matter for purposes of this Section 1.1
or (2) "broker non-votes" have the effect of abstentions but do not also have
the effect of votes against such matter, such "broker non-votes" shall be
considered abstentions for purposes of this Section 1.1) in relation to the
total number of Other Voting Securities that are entitled to vote on such
matter and (b) in the case of written consents, so that the percentage of
Subject Securities Beneficially Owned by the NGP VIII Parties consented to on
any matter equals the percentage of all Other Voting Securities entitled to
consent on such matter so consented as of the date of such consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, this Section 1.1
shall not apply to (A) any vote contemplated by the following provisions of
the Partnership Agreement: (i) the first sentence of Section 11.2, (ii)
Section 13.3(d) and (iii) Section 13.3(e) and (B) any vote to the extent that
pursuant to the Partnership Agreement the NGP VIII Parties are not entitled to
vote on such matter ((A) and (B) collectively, the " **Reserved Matters** ").

 



 

Section 1.2 **Presence at** **Meetings.** To the extent that the power of
attorney and proxy granted in Section 1.5 hereof does not accomplish such
presence (provided that the Partnership will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such power of attorney and proxy to accomplish such
presence), at the written request of the Partnership given with reasonable
(but no less than five Business Days) notice, the NGP VIII Parties shall cause
any Subject Securities

      
 

 



 

Beneficially Owned by the NGP VIII Parties not otherwise required to be
present at a unitholders meeting for purposes of voting for, against or to
abstain in respect of a particular matter in compliance with Section 1.1
(because they represent the proportional allocation to Other Voting Securities
not represented at the meeting) to be present for purposes of calculating a
quorum at such meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, this Section 1.2 shall not apply to the Reserved Matters.

 



 

Section 1.3 **Transfer of Voting Restrictions**. The NGP VIII Parties agree
that they will not Transfer any Subject Securities to any Affiliate unless and
until such transferee has agreed in writing to be bound by this Agreement by
execution of a Joinder Agreement (which such execution shall be deemed, for
all purposes, to be the execution of this Agreement), with such transferee
being deemed to be an NGP VIII Party for purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement other than Section
3.8, this Agreement does not restrict the ability of any NGP VIII Party to
Transfer any Subject Securities to any non-Affiliate at any time or from time
to time, and no such non-Affiliate transferee (and no Subject Securities
Transferred to any non-Affiliate provided that following such Transfer no NGP
VIII Party Beneficially Owns such Subject Securities) will be bound by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.4 **Legends**. The NGP VIII Parties agree that stop transfer
instructions reflecting the terms of this Agreement will be given to the
Partnerships transfer agent with respect to the Subject Securities and that
there will be placed on the certificates representing all Subject Securities
an appropriate legend to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
The Partnership agrees to cause such instructions and legends to be removed
with respect to any Subject Securities no more than one Business Day after the
later of (a) the time this Agreement no longer applies to such Subject
Securities and (b) the date that the relevant NGP VIII Party requests such
removal by notice pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 1.5 **Proxy.** Each of the NGP VIII Parties hereby revokes any and all
previous proxies granted with respect to the Subject Securities. By entering
into this Agreement, each of the NGP VIII Parties hereby grants a power-of-
attorney and proxy appointing the General Partner (to be exercised by the
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel and
the Corporate Secretary (or any of them individually) of the general partner
of the General Partner), with full power of substitution, as such NGP VIII
Partys attorney-in-fact and proxy, for and in such NGP VIII Partys name, to
be counted as present and to vote, to execute written consents or otherwise to
act on behalf of such NGP VIII Party with respect to the Subject Securities in
compliance with the obligations of the NGP VIII Parties pursuant to Section
1.1 and 1.2 (subject to the exclusions in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 with respect to
the Reserved Matters). The power-of-attorney and proxy granted by the NGP VIII
Parties pursuant to this Section 1.5 is irrevocable, is coupled with an
interest, shall survive and not be affected by the subsequent bankruptcy,
dissolution or other similar event with respect to the principal, and is
granted in order to secure the NGP VIII Parties performance under this
Agreement and also in consideration of the Partnership entering into this
Agreement and the Contribution Agreement. The power-of-attorney and proxy
granted by each of the NGP VIII Parties continues for the term of this
Agreement and shall be automatically revoked (a) upon termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b) with respect to any Subject
Securities, upon Transfer of such Subject Securities to a non-Affiliate of the
NGP VIII Parties provided that following such Transfer no NGP VIII Party
Beneficially Owns such Subject Securities. The NGP VIII Parties

 



      
 

 



 

agree not to attempt to revoke, frustrate the exercise of, or challenge the
validity of, the irrevocable proxy granted pursuant to this Section 1.5.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.** ** ****REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

 



 

Section 2.1 **Representations and Warranties of the Partnership**. The
Partnership represents and warrants to the NGP VIII Parties that (a) the
Partnership is a partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good

obligation of the Partnership, and is enforceable against the Partnership in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 2.2 **Representations and Warranties of the NGP VIII Parties**. Each
NGP VIII Party represents and warrants to the Partnership that (a) with
respect to each NGP VIII Party that is not a natural person, such NGP VIII

the laws of its state of formation and has the power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and to carry out its obligations hereunder, (b) the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the NGP VIII Parties and

on its part are necessary to authorize this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (c) this Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by each of the NGP VIII Parties and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each of them, and is enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

 **SECTION 3.** ** ****MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 3.1 **Term**. This Agreement shall terminate upon the occurrence of
_both_ of the following: (A) the date on which the NGP Entities collectively
Beneficially Own (inclusive of any Voting Securities issuable upon exercise of

Outstanding Voting Securities (inclusive of any Voting Securities issuable
upon exercise of any Warrants Beneficially Owned by the NGP Entities) and (B)
the delivery by the NGP VIII Parties to the Partnership of a notice as to the
occurrence of such event and the resulting termination of this Agreement. This
Agreement shall also terminate immediately if the definition of "Outstanding"

NGP Entities in any material respect.

Section 3.3 **Amendments; No Waivers**.

 



 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by all Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against
whom the waiver is to be effective.

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any Party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed as a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

 



 

Section 3.4 **Successors**. All covenants and other agreements contained in
this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the Parties bind and inure to the
benefit of their respective successors whether so expressed or not.

 



 

Section 3.5 **Severability**. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any

 



      
 

 



 

such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full
extent permitted by law) not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

Section 3.6 **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of
copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of
the Parties hereto.

 



 

Section 3.7 **Specific Performance**. The Parties each acknowledge and agree,
and agree not to assert otherwise in any proceeding, that a breach or
threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement by a Party will
cause irreparable injury to the other Parties to this Agreement for which
remedies at law would be inadequate and, in recognition of that fact, agrees
that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by any of them of the
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any remedies at law, the
aggrieved Party, without posting any bond and without any showing of
irreparable injury, shall be entitled to obtain equitable relief in the form
of specific performance, a temporary restraining order, a temporary or
permanent injunction or any other equitable remedy which may then be
available. The provisions of this Section 3.7 are without prejudice to any
other rights that the Parties hereto may have for any breach of this
Agreement. The Parties further agree not to assert in any proceeding that
grounds for any equitable relief are not satisfied.

 



 

Section 3.8 **Protections and Benefits of Agreement**. ** **None of the NGP
VIII Parties shall take any knowing or intentional action to deprive the
Partnership of the benefits and protections afforded by this Agreement,
including without limitation selling any of the Subject Securities to a Person
that is not an Affiliate of the NGP VIII Parties with an agreement or
understanding that such Subject Securities will be re-purchased by the NGP
VIII Parties or any of their Affiliates free and clear of any restrictions
contained in this Agreement or with an agreement or understanding to vote such
Subject Securities in a manner directed by the NGP VIII Parties.

 



 

Section 3.9 **Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced
in accordance with, and the rights of the Parties shall be governed by, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of law
principles thereof. Any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall only be instituted in the Delaware Chancery Court, and
if such court should decline jurisdiction, then in the Federal courts within
the State of Delaware. Each Party agrees to personal jurisdiction in any
action brought in any court within the State of Delaware having subject matter
jurisdiction over the matters arising under this Agreement. Each Party waives
any objection which it may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of
such action or proceeding and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any
such court in any such suit, action or proceeding. The Parties unconditionally
waive any right to trial by jury in any such suit, action or proceeding.

 

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed as of the date first referred to above.

hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

 



 

1. **_Prior Rights and Obligations_** _._ The Parties agree that this Release, the Contribution Agreement, and any other agreements entered into pursuant to the Contribution Agreement [(including the applicable Confidentiality, Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreement[ and the applicable Consulting Agreement])] will extinguish and supersede all rights, if any, which Employee-Contributor or the Company Entities may have, contractual or otherwise, relating to (a) the Employee-Contributors continued employment with, or termination from employment, with any of the Company Entities or (b) Employee-Contributors ownership of any equity or other interests in any of the Company Entities (including any incentive units, options, warrants or other rights to

3. **_The Company Entities  and the Partnerships Release of Claims Against Employee-Contributor_**. Each of the Company Entities and the Partnership releases and discharges Employee-Contributor from any and all obligations and claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or unknown, that have accrued or may accrue and that relate to acts or omissions prior to Closing or that relate to the Closing (including any and all damages, whether known or unknown, arising by statute, common law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, of any kind, character or nature whatsoever) (1) arising under the Organizational Documents, (2) relating to Employee-Contributors ownership of any equity or other interests in any of the Company Entities, (3) relating to actions or omissions of Employee-Contributor, in each case to the extent that such actions or omissions relate to the ownership or operation of the Company Entities, or (4) in connection with Employee-Contributor acting in his or her capacity as an employee of CC Operating at or prior to Closing, including in each case any and all claims which any of the Company Entities or the Partnership does not know or suspect to exist in its favor as of the date hereof or upon Closing (collectively, the " ** _Company s Released Claims_**"); provided, however, the Companys Released Claims shall not include such claims or causes of action that arise out of (i) the representations, warranties or covenants made by Employee-Contributor in this Release or by Employee-Contributor or the Company Entities in the Contribution Agreement or the other documents and instruments delivered pursuant thereto or (ii) any right under the Contribution Agreement or any other agreement to which the Partnership and Employee-Contributor are parties. Each of the Company Entities and the Partnership agrees not to file or permit to be filed or accept benefit from any claim, complaint or petition relating to the Companys Released Claims; provided, however, this shall not limit any of the Company Entities or the Partnership from filing an action for the sole purpose of enforcing its rights under this Release. THE RELEASES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, AND EACH OF THE COMPANY ENTITIES AND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREES TO WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF ANY LAW

 



      
 

 



 

(INCLUDING PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW) OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION THAT PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS
WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN SUCH PARTYS
FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY SUCH PARTY MUST
HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED ITS SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.

 



 

4. **_Employee-Contributor s Release of Claims Against the Company Entities and the Partnership_**.

 



 

(a) _Release of Claims Arising out Employee-Contributor s Employment_.
Employee-Contributor releases and discharges the Company Entities and the
Partnership, along with their owners, partners, members, affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys, and insurers (collectively, the " **
_Company Released Parties_** "), from any and all claims, demands and causes
of action, whether known or unknown, arising by statute, common law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, of any kind, character or nature whatsoever,
arising from Employee-Contributors employment, or termination from
employment, at CC Operating, including any claims for salary, benefits,
expenses, costs, damages, compensation, remuneration or wages and any claims
of alleged discriminatory employment practices including any claims or causes
of action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. By entering into
this Release, Employee-Contributor is not waiving (i) any rights under any
Employee Plan or under COBRA, (ii) any rights to receive Employee-
Contributors ordinary compensation from the Company Entities in return for
work performed between the date hereof and the Closing, (iii) any payments for
accrued vacation through the Closing; (iv) any rights that cannot by law be
waived; and (vi) any rights under the Contribution Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Release of Claims Arising out of Employee-Contributor s Ownership of the
Company Entities and Contribution to the Partnership_. Employee-Contributor
also releases and discharges the Company Released Parties from any and all
obligations and claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or
unknown, that have accrued or may accrue and that relate to acts or omissions
prior to Closing or that relate to the Closing (including any and all damages,
whether known or unknown, arising by statute, common law, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, of any kind, character or nature whatsoever) (1) arising under
the Organizational Documents, (2) relating to the Employee-Contributors
ownership (or alleged ownership) of any equity or other interests in any of
the Company Entities (including any incentive units, options, warrants or
other rights to acquire any equity or other interest in any of the Company
Entities whether vested or unvested as of the date hereof), (3) relating to
the adequacy of the Employee-Contributor Contribution Consideration or (4)
relating to actions or omissions of the Company Entities, or any acts or
omissions of the managers, directors, shareholders, members, officers or
employees (former or present) of the Company Entities, including in each case
any and all claims which such Employee-Contributor does not know or suspect to
exist in his, her or its favor as of the date hereof or upon Closing
(collectively, together with the claims released pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4(a) of this Release, the " ** _Employee-Contributor s Released
Claims_**"); provided, however, the Employee-Contributors Released Claims
shall not include such claims or causes of action that arise out of (i) the
representations, warranties or covenants made by the Partnership in this
Release or the Contribution Agreement or the other documents and instruments
delivered pursuant thereto, or (ii) any right of Employee-Contributor under
the Contribution Agreement or any other agreement to which the Partnership and
Employee-Contributor are parties. Effective upon Closing, Employee-Contributor
waives any preemptive rights that he or she may have, or ever had, with
respect to any interest in the Company Entities and waives any right Employee-
Contributor may have under the Company Entities Organizational Documents or
otherwise to acquire any interest in the Company Entities being transferred
pursuant to, or as contemplated by, the Contribution Agreement or any transfer
that occurred prior to the date thereof. Employee-Contributor agrees not to
file or permit to be filed or accept benefit from any claim, complaint or
petition relating to Employee-Contributors Released Claims; provided,
however, this shall not limit Employee-Contributor from filing an action for
the sole purpose of enforcing its rights under this Release. THE RELEASES
APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, AND EMPLOYEE-CONTRIBUTOR AGREES TO WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF
ANY LAW (INCLUDING PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW) OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION THAT PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN SUCH
PARTYS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY SUCH
PARTY MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS/HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED
PARTY.

 



 

5. **_Warranties_** **.** Employee-Contributor agrees, represents and warrants that:

 



 

(a) The Employee-Contributor Contribution Consideration is fair value for his
or her Company Interests, and such fair value received and the releases and
other agreements made by the Company Entities and the Partnership in this
Release are good and sufficient consideration for his or her execution of this
Release.

 



 

(b) Employee-Contributor will sign this Release when the Contribution
Agreement is executed, but the Release will not become effective until
Closing. In the event that the Contribution Agreement is terminated prior to
the Closing, this Release shall thereupon become void and of no force or
effect. Employee-Contributor agrees that he or she will reaffirm and ratify
this Release upon Closing by signing the attached Supplemental Mutual Release
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Employee-Contributor has not filed any claims, appeals, complaints,
charges or lawsuits against the Company Entities with any governmental agency
or court.

 



 

(d) Employee-Contributor acknowledges and agrees that he or she (i) has
received or had full access to all the information he or she considered
necessary or appropriate to make an informed decision with respect to his or
her execution of

 



      
 

 



 

the Contribution Agreement and this Release and (ii) has had an opportunity to
ask questions and receive answers from the Company Entities and the
Partnership regarding the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement
and this Release.

 



 

Each of the Company Entities and the Partnership agrees, represents and
warrants that it will reaffirm and ratify this Release upon Closing by signing

hereinafter referred to, collectively, the " ** _Parties_** " and,
individually, as a " ** _Party_**." Any defined term used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the meaning given such term in the Contribution
Agreement (as hereinafter defined).

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Manager is a manager on the Board of Managers of the Company;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Manager will cease to be a manager on the Board of Managers of
the Company at the Closing;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , pursuant to that certain Membership Interest Contribution
Agreement, dated as of , 2011 (the " ** _Contribution
Agreement_** "), by and among the Company Entities, the Partnership, Natural
Gas Partners VIII, L.P. (" ** _NGP_** ") and certain contributors thereto, the
delivery by Manager of this Release is a condition to Closing; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Parties desire to mutually release each other from claims
and causes of action as hereinafter set forth.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

 



 

1. **_Prior Rights and Obligations_** _._ The Parties agree that this Release, the Contribution Agreement, and any other agreements entered into pursuant to the Contribution Agreement will extinguish and supersede all rights, if any, which Manager or the Company Entities may have, contractual or otherwise, relating to Managers continued service on, or resignation from, the Board of Managers of any Company Entity, including any rights under the Company Entities certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement or similar organizational documents or agreements, including (a) the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Company, dated as of October 31, 2006, as amended as of the date hereof (the " ** _Company LLC Agreement_** "), and (b) the Advisory Services, Reimbursement and Indemnification Agreement, effective as of October 31, 2006, by and between the Company and NGP (the " ** _Advisory Services Agreement_** " and collectively, the " ** _Organizational Documents_** ").

      
 

 



 

2. **_Consideration_**. The Parties agree that by mutually releasing any claims that they might have against each other, their respective releases in this Release are supported by sufficient consideration.

 



 

3. **_Manager s Release of Claims Against the Company Entities and the Partnership_**. Manager releases and discharges the Company Entities and the Partnership, along with their owners, partners, members, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, and insurers (collectively, the " ** _Company Released Parties_** "), from any and all obligations and claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or unknown, that have accrued or may accrue and that relate to acts or omissions prior to Closing or that relate to the Closing (including any and all damages, whether known or unknown, arising by statute, common law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, of any kind, character or nature whatsoever) (1) arising from Managers service on, or resignation from, the Board of Managers of the Company (including any claims for compensation, benefits, expenses, costs, damages or remuneration), (2) arising under the Organizational Documents, or (3) relating to actions or omissions of the Company Entities, or any acts or omissions of the managers, directors, shareholders, members, officers or employees (former or present) of the Company Entities, including in each case any and all claims which such Manager does not know or suspect to exist in its favor as of the date hereof or upon Closing (collectively, the " ** _Company s Released Claims_**"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Release shall limit in any way any right Manager may have under (i) Section 7.08 of the Contribution Agreement or otherwise to seek indemnification under Article XIII of the Contribution Agreement or (ii) any other agreement to which the Partnership and Manager are parties. Manager agrees not to file or permit to be filed or accept benefit from any claim, complaint or petition relating to the Companys Released Claims; provided, however, this shall not limit Manager from filing an action for the sole purpose of enforcing its rights under this Release. THE RELEASES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, AND MANAGER AGREES TO WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF ANY LAW (INCLUDING PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW) OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN SUCH PARTYS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY SUCH PARTY MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.

 



 

4. **_Release of Claims Against Manager by the Company Entities and the Partnership_**.

Notwithstanding anything herein

 



      
 

 



 

to the contrary, nothing in this Release shall limit in any way any right of
the Partnership (i) to seek indemnification under Article XIII of the
Contribution Agreement or (ii) under any agreement to which the Partnership
and Manager are parties. Each of the Company Entities and the Partnership
agrees not to file or permit to be filed or accept benefit from any claim,
complaint or petition relating to any matter released and discharged under
this Section 4; provided, however, this shall not limit any of the Company
Entities or the Partnership from filing an action for the sole purpose of
enforcing its rights under this Release. THE RELEASES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, AND
EACH OF THE COMPANY ENTITIES AND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREES TO WAIVE THE BENEFITS
OF ANY LAW (INCLUDING PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW) OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR
ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN SUCH
PARTYS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY SUCH
PARTY MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY.

 



 

5. **_Warranties_** **.** Manager agrees, represents and warrants that:

 



 

(a) The releases and other agreements made by the Company Entities and the
Partnership in this Release are good and sufficient consideration for its
execution of this Release.

conditions of this Release.

 



 

Each of the Company Entities and the Partnership agrees, represents and
warrants that the releases and other agreements made by Manager in this
Release are good and sufficient consideration for its execution of this
Release.

 



 

6. **_Choice of Law_**. This Release shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas (without regard to any conflicts of law principle which would require the application of some other state law).

 



 

7. **_Acknowledgment of Terms_**. Manager acknowledges that it had the opportunity for review of this Release by its attorney, Manager fully understands its final and binding effect, and Manager is signing this Release voluntarily.

rights or obligations arising hereunder, nor shall this failure preclude the
enforcement of any term or provision or avoid the liability for any breach of
this Release.

 



 

9. **_Severability_** **.** Each part, term or provision of this Release is severable from the others. Notwithstanding any possible future finding by a duly constituted authority that a particular part, term or provision is invalid, void or unenforceable, this Release has been made with the clear intention that the validity and enforceability of the remaining parts, terms and provisions shall not be affected thereby.

Agreement) allocated to Contributor pursuant to the Contribution Agreement
(the " ** _NGP Contribution Consideration_** "); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Parties desire to mutually release each other from claims
and causes of action as hereinafter set forth.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:

 



 

1. **_Prior Rights and Obligations_** _._ The Parties agree that this Release, the Contribution Agreement, and any other agreements entered into pursuant to the Contribution Agreement will extinguish and supersede all rights, if any, which Contributor or the Company Entities may have, contractual or otherwise, relating to Contributors ownership of any equity or other interests in any of the Company Entities (including any options, warrants or other rights to acquire any equity or other interest in any of the Company Entities), including any rights under the Company Entities certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement or similar organizational documents or agreements, including (a) the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Company, dated as of October 31, 2006, as amended as of the date hereof (the " ** _Company LLC Agreement_** "), (b) the Voting and Members Agreement, effective as of October 31, 2006 by and among the Company, Contributor and certain other parties thereto (the " ** _Voting Agreement_** "), (c) the Advisory Services, Reimbursement and Indemnification Agreement, effective as of October 31, 2006, by and between the Company and Contributor (the " ** _Advisory Services Agreement_** "), and (d) the Subscription and

_Organizational Documents_** ").

 



 

2. **_Consideration_**. Contributor agrees and acknowledges that the NGP Contribution Consideration and other benefits received by Contributor pursuant to the Contribution Agreement are sufficient consideration for Contributors release in this Release.

 



 

3. **_Contributor s Release of Claims Against the Company Entities and the Partnership_**. Contributor releases and discharges the Company Entities and the Partnership, along with their owners, partners, members, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, and insurers (collectively, the " ** _Company Released Parties_** "), from any and all obligations and claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or unknown, that have accrued or may accrue and that relate to acts or omissions prior to Closing or that relate to the Closing (including any and all damages, whether known or unknown, arising by statute, common law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, of any kind, character or nature whatsoever) (1) arising under the Organizational Documents, (2) relating to the Contributors ownership (or alleged ownership) of any equity or other interests in any of the Company Entities (including any incentive units, options, warrants or other rights to acquire any equity or other interest in any of the Company Entities whether vested or unvested as of the date hereof), (3) relating to the adequacy of the NGP Contribution Consideration or (4) relating to actions or omissions of the Company Entities, or any acts or omissions of the managers, directors, shareholders, members, officers or employees (former or present) of the Company Entities, in each case to the extent that such acts or omissions relate to the ownership or operation of the Company Entities, including in each case any and all claims which such Contributor does not know or suspect to exist in its favor as of the date hereof or upon Closing (collectively, the " ** _Company s Released Claims_**"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Release shall limit in any way any right of Contributor under (i) Section 7.08 of the Contribution Agreement, if applicable, or otherwise to seek indemnification under Article XIII of the Contribution Agreement or (ii) any other agreement to which the Partnership and Contributor are parties, including the Registration Rights Agreement and the Voting Agreement. Effective upon Closing, Contributor waives any preemptive rights that it may have, or ever had, with respect to any interest in the Company Entities and waives any right Contributor may have under the Company Entities Organizational Documents or otherwise to acquire any interest in the Company Entities being transferred pursuant to, or as contemplated by, the Contribution Agreement or any transfer that occurred prior to the date thereof. Contributor agrees not to file or permit to be filed or accept benefit from any claim, complaint or petition relating to the Companys Released Claims; provided, however, this shall not limit Contributor from filing an action for the sole purpose of enforcing its rights under this Release. THE RELEASES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, AND CONTRIBUTOR AGREES TO WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF ANY LAW (INCLUDING PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW) OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN SUCH PARTYS FAVOR AT THE 

 



      
 

 



 

TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY SUCH PARTY MUST HAVE

Each of the Company Entities and the Partnership releases and discharges Contributor, along with its owners, partners, members, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, and insurers (collectively, the " ** _Contributor Released Parties_** "), from any and all obligations and claims, demands and causes of action, whether known or unknown, that have accrued or may accrue and that relate to acts or omissions prior to Closing or that relate to the Closing (including any and all damages, whether known or unknown, arising by statute, common law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, of any kind, character or nature whatsoever) (1) arising under the Organizational Documents, (2) relating to the Contributors ownership of any equity or other interests in any of the Company Entities or (3) relating to actions or omissions of Contributor, or any acts or omissions of the managers, directors, shareholders, members, officers or employees (former or present) of Contributor, in each case to the extent that such acts or omissions relate to the ownership or operation of the Company Entities, including in each case any and all claims which any of the Company Entities or the Partnership does not know or suspect to exist in its favor as of the date hereof or upon Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Release shall limit in any way any right of the Partnership (i) to seek indemnification under Article XIII of the Contribution Agreement or (ii) under any agreement to which the Partnership and Contributor are parties, including the Registration Rights Agreement and the Voting Agreement. Each of the Company Entities and the Partnership agrees not to file or permit to be filed or accept benefit from any claim, complaint or petition relating to any matter released and discharged under this Section 4; provided, however, this shall not limit any of the Company Entities or the Partnership from filing an action for the sole purpose of enforcing its rights under this Release. THE RELEASES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, AND EACH OF THE COMPANY ENTITIES AND THE PARTNERSHIP AGREES TO WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF ANY LAW (INCLUDING PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW) OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION THAT PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN SUCH PARTYS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY SUCH PARTY MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.
