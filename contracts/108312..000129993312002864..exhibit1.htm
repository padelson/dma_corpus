Statement_ ") of its estimate of Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated
Working Capital_ ") as of the Closing and its estimate of the Purchase Price,
together with a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculations supporting Sellers computation thereof. The Closing Statement
and the Estimated Working Capital Statement are set forth on Section 2.6 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule.   

2.7 _Preliminary Statement._    

(a) Not later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a statement setting forth Buyers good faith calculation
(the " _Preliminary Statement_ ") of the Net Working Capital as of the
Closing (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ") and the Purchase Price,
as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.8, together with a schedule setting forth
in reasonable detail the calculations supporting Buyers computation thereof.
The Closing Working Capital will be determined in accordance with the
Applicable Accounting Principles and the manner of calculating Net Working
Capital set forth on _Exhibit E_ attached hereto.   

(b) Within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, either Buyer or
Seller may elect to schedule a telephonic or in-person meeting with the other
party to discuss the Preliminary Statement and Closing Working Capital and
both parties agree to attend such meeting, provided that the requesting party
shall provide the nonrequesting party at least seven days notice of
such meeting.   

(c) During Buyers preparation of the Preliminary Statement and the period of
any review or dispute within the contemplation of this Section 2.7, (i) Buyer
will (A) provide Seller and Sellers authorized representatives with
reasonable access to all work papers and records related to the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and the preparation of the
Preliminary Statement, and (B) cooperate with Seller and Sellers authorized
representatives, including providing, on a timely basis, such additional
information as may be reasonably requested by Seller and providing reasonable
access to Seller employees, if any, directly responsible for
and knowledgeable about the information used in and the preparation of the
Preliminary Statement, and (ii) Seller will (A) provide Buyer and Buyers
authorized representatives with reasonable access to all work papers and
records related to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and
the preparation of the Preliminary Statement, and (B) cooperate with Buyer
and Buyers authorized representatives, including providing, on a timely
basis, such additional information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
and providing reasonable access to Buyers employees, if any, directly
responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in and the
preparation of the Preliminary Statement.   

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, if, within 45 days following
its receipt of the Preliminary Statement, Seller does not dispute in
accordance with this Section 2.7 Buyers calculation of the Closing Working
Capital or Purchase Price set forth thereon, the Preliminary Statement and
the Closing Working Capital and Purchase Price set forth thereon will be
deemed to be final for all purposes under this Agreement (the Preliminary
Statement, Closing Working Capital and Purchase Price set forth thereon
determined in accordance with this Section 2.7(d) or as determined in
accordance with Section 2.7(e), as the case may be, being the " _Final Closing
Working Capital Statement_ ").   

(e) If Seller elects to dispute the Preliminary Statement or the calculations
set forth thereon (any such disputed item being a " _Disputed Item_ "):   

(i) Seller will notify Buyer in writing within 45 days after Sellers receipt
of the Preliminary Statement, which notice will specify in reasonable detail
the nature of the dispute with respect to any Disputed Item.   

(ii) During the 45 day period following Buyers receipt of such notice, Buyer
and Seller will attempt to resolve the dispute with respect to any such
Disputed Items and to determine the final calculation of Closing Working
Capital and the Purchase Price.   

(iii) If, at the end of the 45 day period specified in subsection (d)(ii)
above, Buyer and Seller will have failed to reach a written agreement with
respect to all or any portion of such Disputed Items (those items that remain
in dispute at the end of such period are the " _Unresolved Items_ "), the
Unresolved Items will be referred for resolution to PricewaterhouseCoopers
(the " _Neutral Auditors_ ") within ten days of the end of such period. If
PricewaterhouseCoopers refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Neutral
Auditors, Seller and Buyer will cooperate in good faith to appoint another
independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of national
recognition mutually agreeable to Seller and Buyer, in which event "Neutral
Auditors" will mean such firm. During the review by the Neutral Auditors,
Seller and Buyer will each make available to the Neutral Auditors such
individuals and such information, books, records and workpapers as may be
reasonably required by the Neutral Auditors to fulfill its
obligations hereunder.   

(iv) Each party hereto agrees to execute, if requested by the Neutral
Auditors, a reasonable engagement letter with the Neutral Auditors. The fees
and expenses of the Neutral Auditors will be borne by Seller and Buyer in the
same proportion that the dollar amount of Unresolved Items lost by a party
bears to the total dollar amount of the Unresolved Items. Each party will bear
the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other
expenses in connection with matters contemplated by this Section 2.7(e)(iv).
The Neutral Auditors will act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely on
the provisions of this Agreement and the presentations by Seller and Buyer,
or representatives thereof, and not by independent review, only the resolution
of the Unresolved Items. In resolving any Unresolved Item, the Neutral
Auditors may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value
for such item asserted by either party or less than the smallest value for
such item asserted by either party. The parties will use reasonable efforts
to cause the Neutral Auditors to issue their resolution within 30 days after
the submission of the Unresolved Items to the Neutral Auditors. The Neutral
Auditors resolution of the Unresolved Items will be set forth in a written
statement delivered to Seller and Buyer. Such resolution will be deemed to be
mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller for all purposes of this Agreement
and will be final and binding on, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto.
Either party will be entitled to have judgment entered upon such resolution,
in a manner consistent with such resolution, in any court having
jurisdiction. If the Unresolved Items are resolved by the Neutral Auditors,
the Final Closing Working Capital Statement will consist of the applicable
amounts from the Preliminary Statement (or amounts otherwise agreed to in
writing by Seller and Buyer) as to items that have not been submitted for
resolution to the Neutral Auditors, and the amounts determined by the
Neutral Auditors as to the Unresolved Items that were submitted for
resolution by the Neutral Auditors. Any changes to the Preliminary Statement
resulting from such resolution of the Unresolved Items will be made, and such
Preliminary Statement, as so changed, will be the Final Closing
Working Capital Statement for all purposes under this Agreement.   

2.8 _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " will
be an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital as set forth on the Final
Closing Working Capital Statement  _minus_ the Estimated Working Capital. If
the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Buyer will pay to
Seller the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Seller will pay to Buyer the
absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment.   

2.9 _Payment and Interest_.   

(a) Any payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.8 will be made
within five days after the Final Closing Working Capital Statement has been
finally determined in accordance with Section 2.7(d) or (e) hereof, by wire
transfer to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, of immediately available
funds from such party to a designated account of such other party.   

(b) The amount of any payment pursuant to Section 2.8 will bear interest from
but not including the day on which the Closing occurs to and excluding the
date of payment at a fixed per annum rate equal to the federal funds
effective rate (as published by the Federal Reserve System) in effect on the
date immediately prior to the date of payment _plus_ one and one half
percent (1.5%).   

2.10 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place via electronic exchange of documents and
signatures on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of
all conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in Articles VI and
VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions) (or, if such
date falls after the End Date, such earlier date after satisfaction of such
conditions that is on or prior to the End Date), or at such other place or at
such other time or on such other date as Seller and Buyer may mutually agree
upon in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein

determine and allocate Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 10.1) for the
parties to agree on an allocation of a portion of the Purchase Price
(including Assumed Liabilities to the extent such Assumed Liabilities
constitute part of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes) to the Purchased
Assets or the Business located in such jurisdiction, each of Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other and shall agree on a reasonable allocation of
a portion of the Purchase Price to such Purchased Assets and shall, to
the extent possible, memorialize such agreement in such documents as are
utilized to effectuate the transfers of such Purchased Assets.

Assets. The Designated Buyer must execute and deliver to Seller a counterpart
to this Agreement. Buyer and Designated Buyer will jointly and severally
undertake the obligations and liabilities of Buyer under this Agreement.

(a) Seller and those Affiliates of Seller listed on Section 3.7 of the Seller

Closing Date (assuming receipt of all Consents set forth of Sections 3.2(b)

to Buyer hereunder, together with the other rights and assets being licensed
or acquired by Buyer hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements and the
services to be provided by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of
the Ancillary Agreements, will constitute all of the tangible and intangible
assets of any nature whatsoever, necessary to operate the Business immediately
after the Closing in substantially the same manner conducted by Seller in the

Seller Marks);  _provided_ , _however_ that this Section 3.7 will not be
deemed to be breached as a result of any action of Seller or its Affiliates
expressly required by or performed in accordance with Section 5.1 or for
which Buyer has provided its consent executed by the General Counsel of Buyer
(including pursuant to Section 5.1).   

(b) All material tangible assets (whether owned or leased) included in the

of dedication, that are necessary to allow interconnection, vehicular and
pedestrian ingress and egress to and from the Owned Real Property. The Owned
Real Property is in material compliance with all applicable laws, easements,
covenants and similar restrictions, building restrictions and other zoning,
building, fire and safety codes or regulations for its intended use. All
components of all buildings, structures and other improvements included in or
located on the Owned Real Property are in good operating condition and
repair, except for normal wear and tear, sufficient in all material respects
for Seller to operate the Business as presently conducted.   

3.9 _Transactions with Affiliates_. Section 3.9 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule contains a list of all Contracts between Seller with respect to the
Business, on the one hand, and any Affiliate of Seller, on the other,

3.10 _Intellectual Property_.   

(a) Section 3.10(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and

that is Registered and indicates, for each listed item, the owner of such
Intellectual Property, the jurisdiction in which such Intellectual Property
is Registered, the registration or application number, and the filing
dates thereof. Section 3.10(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list (by name and version number) of all Business
Products.   

(b) To the Knowledge of Seller, all of the Transferred IP is valid, subsisting
and enforceable. All the Transferred IP that is Registered is in good

such registration or application will be abandoned. Set forth in
Section 3.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a list of any renewals,

and all of the Transferred IP is wholly and exclusively owned by Seller or
its Affiliates free and clear of Liens other than Permitted Liens and neither
Seller nor its Affiliates has sold, transferred, assigned or otherwise
disposed of any rights or interests therein or thereto. With respect to any
Transferred IP of which Seller or its Affiliates is a joint owner or co-
owner, there are no restrictions (by agreement with any third party joint
owner or co-owner of such Transferred IP or otherwise) on Sellers or its
Affiliates exercise of the full scope of rights afforded a joint owner or co-
owner of that type of Intellectual Property right under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which the Intellectual Property right exists.   

(d) On the Closing Date, the rights in the Transferred IP conveyed to Buyer
hereunder, together with the Intellectual Property rights being licensed to
Buyer or that Buyer otherwise has the right to use under an Ancillary
Agreement, will constitute all of the Intellectual Property rights necessary
to operate the Business immediately after the Closing in substantially the
same manner conducted by Seller in the 12 months prior to the date hereof;
provided, however, that the foregoing representation and warranty is not
intended to be a representation regarding the absence of infringement or
misappropriation, which is addressed in Section 3.10(e). Seller and each
Seller Affiliate has a valid license to use the Licensed Business IP, subject
only to the terms of the Business IP Agreements. Seller and its Affiliates
have sufficient rights to use the Business IP in connection with the
operation of the Business, all of which rights will survive the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unchanged. Seller has the
authority to grant to Buyer the licenses in the Retained Business IP granted
hereunder and under the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement and
Seller has not granted any licenses to any third party inconsistent with the
rights granted hereunder or under the Intellectual Property Cross-
License Agreement.   

(e) The operation of the Business, including the design, development, use,
import, export, manufacture, licensing, sale or other disposition of Business
Products and the provision of service offerings, does not infringe,
misappropriate or violate the Intellectual Property (other than Patents) of

not done so in the last two years. No claims have been asserted in writing
against Seller or any of its Affiliates alleging that such operation or any
Business Product or the provision of any service offerings infringes,
misappropriates or violates the Intellectual Property rights of any
Person.   

(f) To the Knowledge of Seller, no Person is engaging, or has engaged in the
last two years, in any activity that infringes, misappropriates or otherwise
violates or conflicts with any Intellectual Property included in the
Purchased Assets, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has asserted
any claim of infringement, misappropriation, or misuse against any
third party with respect to the Transferred IP.   

(g) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has granted or is obligated to
grant to any third party any license or other right to any Transferred IP. To
the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates has granted or is obligated to
grant to any third party any license or other right to any Transferred IP,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has granted or is obligated to
grant to any such third party any ownership rights, exclusive rights or right
to sublicense any such Transferred IP.   

(h) All confidential information used or held for use in connection with the
operation of the Business has at all times been maintained in confidence and
otherwise in a manner that is customary in and consistent with Sellers
industry and the industry of the Business. Seller and its Affiliates have
taken all reasonable actions (for example, entering into nondisclosure
agreements and affixing notices) necessary to secure and maintain the secrecy
of such confidential information as a trade secret and as is customary and
consistent with Sellers industry and the industry of the Business. No
confidential information, trade secrets or other confidential Transferred IP
have been disclosed by Seller or its Affiliates to any Person except pursuant
to valid and appropriate non-disclosure or license agreements that have not
been breached.

consultants, and contractors, who have conceived or developed any Business
Products or any Transferred IP either (i) were bona fide employees of Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller in the United States and products or Intellectual

have executed appropriate instruments of assignment in favor of Seller or an
Seller Affiliate as assignee that have conveyed to Seller or an Seller
Affiliate ownership of all Intellectual Property thereby arising.

Source Materials obligations related to Software included in any Business
Product, Owned Business Software or service offering of the Business
and material to the operation of the Business. None of Seller or any of its

review or renegotiation by Boeing in connection with the transactions

Party that (i) was, is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a breach of this Section 5.2 by the Receiving Party or
its Representatives, (ii) was or is developed by the Receiving
Party independently of and without reference to any Confidential Information
of the Disclosing Party, (iii) was, is or becomes available to the Receiving
Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party not bound by a
confidentiality agreement or any legal, fiduciary or other
obligation restricting disclosure, (iv) may be required to be disclosed
pursuant to the terms of a Governmental Order, under applicable Law or by any
Governmental Entity (including any self-regulatory organization on which the
Receiving Partys securities (or those of its Affiliates) are listed),
_provided_ , however, that the Receiving Party or such Affiliate advises
the Person to which such disclosure is made of the confidential nature of the
information and, if permitted by Law, regulation and applicable supervisory
authority, gives the Disclosing Party such notice as may be reasonably
practicable under the circumstances, or (v) is in response to any summons,
subpoena or other legal process or formal or informal investigative demand
issued by a Government Entity to the Receiving Party or its Affiliates in the
course of any Action;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Receiving Party or
any such Affiliate shall notify the Disclosing Party of such intended
disclosure and reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party in its efforts
to limit or restrict such disclosure, at the sole cost of the Disclosing
Party. Neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller will disclose any
Confidential Information of Seller relating to any of the Purchased Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities in reliance on the exceptions in clauses (ii) or
(iii) above.   

5.3 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents_.   

(a) Buyer and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i)
obtain, as expeditiously as possible and not later than December 27, 2012 (or
if not obtained by such date, as expeditiously as possible thereafter), all
Governmental Approvals that may be, or become, necessary for the execution,
delivery and performance of, and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) resolve,
as expeditiously as possible and not later than December 27, 2012 (or if not
obtained by such date, as expeditiously as possible thereafter), such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements under the HSR Act and any other Law in any relevant jurisdiction,
(iii) avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any
suit or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (including, by defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
by the Ancillary Agreements) and (iv) promptly secure the issuance, reissuance
or transfer of all Permits necessary to operate the Business in compliance
with Law. Seller and Buyer will cooperate with the reasonable requests of the
other in seeking promptly to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals and the issuance, reissuance or transfer (to the extent
permitted by Law) of Permits. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any action
that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying, impairing
or impeding the receipt of any required authorizations, consents, waivers,
orders or approvals.   

(i) Each of Seller and Buyer has made an appropriate filing of a notification
and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and agrees to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. In addition, each party hereto agrees to
make promptly any filing that may be required with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
under any other antitrust or competition Law or by any other antitrust
or competition authority. Buyer shall have sole responsibility for the filing
fees associated with any filings required in jurisdictions outside the United
States.   

(ii) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto of any oral or written communication it receives from any Governmental
Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, permit
the other parties hereto to review in advance any communication proposed to
be made by such party to any Governmental Entity and provide the
other parties hereto with copies of all correspondence, filings or other
communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand,
subject to Section 5.2(g). No party to this Agreement shall agree
to participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other parties hereto in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties hereto
the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreements and to Section 5.2(g), the parties to this
Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other parties hereto
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (and any
similar Law in any other relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction). Nothing in this
Section 5.3(a)(ii) shall be applicable to Tax matters.   

(iii) Without limiting the obligations of Buyer and Seller in Section
5.3(a)(i), Buyer and Seller shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any third party or
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements under the HSR Act and any similar Law in
any other relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction.   

(b) Each party to this Agreement agrees to reasonably cooperate and to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each third party Consent that may
be required by the terms of the applicable Contract in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither
Buyer nor Seller shall be required to compensate any third party, commence or
participate in litigation or offer or grant any financial accommodation to
any third party to obtain any such consent or approval.   

5.4 _Marks_.   

(a) Buyer acknowledges that, from and after the Closing Seller and its
Affiliates will have and retain the absolute and exclusive proprietary right
to all of Sellers and such Affiliates respective Trademarks, including all
Trademarks incorporating "GE" or "GE Aviation" by itself or in combination
with any other mark (collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "), and that none of
the rights thereto or goodwill represented thereby or pertaining thereto are
being transferred hereby or in connection herewith. Following the Closing
Date, Buyer will not, nor will it permit its Affiliates to, use any Seller
Marks in or on any of its or their properties, literature, sales materials
or products or otherwise in connection with the sale of any products or
services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates may
continue to distribute Business Products and products that the Business
produces after the Closing Date that include or display the Seller Marks
(including as a result of the use of a mold or die used by the Business in
which Seller Marks are embedded) and use and reproduce advertising materials,
packaging, documentation, Software, stationery, forms, labels and other
similar materials included in the Purchased Assets, in each case, for a period
of not more than 18 months after the Closing Date; provided, however, that
if, in connection with any change to, or discontinuance of, the use of any
Seller Marks in connection with any particular Business Products or other
materials, the approval of a Governmental Entity is required or any customer
Contract requires the approval of the applicable customer, then Buyer may
continue to use such Seller Marks in connection with such Business Products
or other materials until such approval is obtained. Buyer will diligently
pursue such approvals. In addition, Buyer will have no obligation to modify
or update any Business Products distributed prior to the Closing Date
to remove or prevent the continued inclusion or display of the Seller
Marks.   

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall have the right, at all times after the Closing Date, to (i)
retain and use (solely for internal business purposes) records and other
documents and materials containing or referencing the Seller Marks as such
records, documents and materials exist as of the Closing Date, and (ii) use
the Seller Marks to refer to the historical fact the Business was previously
conducted under the Seller Marks.   

5.5 _Employee Matters_.   

(a) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will make (i) any offer of
employment to any individual to become a Business Employee or (ii) any change
in status concerning promotion, transfer, termination without "cause" or any
increase in any compensation of any employee exclusively engaged in the
Business (each, a " _Business Employee_ ") outside the ordinary course
of business, without the consent of Buyer. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and
agree that the Business Employees shall continue to be employed by Seller
until the day before the Transfer Date pursuant to the Employee Services
Agreement.   

(b) Effective as of the Transfer Date, Buyer will offer comparable employment
as a successor employer to all unrepresented Business Employees (except for
the Retained Employee) who are actively employed (including employees on
vacation, holiday, jury duty, or other similar absence) by Seller or any of
its Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer Date. Buyer also shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, offer re-instatement or employment as a
successor employer, as the case may be, to each unrepresented Business
Employee who is not actively employed immediately prior to the Transfer Date
and who has a right of reinstatement pursuant to Seller policy or
applicable Law (collectively, " _Inactive Contract Employees_ "), in each
case promptly upon his or her return from any leave or other absence. All
Business Employees to whom Buyer offers employment and who accept such
employment are herein referred to as the " _Hired Employees_ ," and any
Inactive Contract Employee shall be treated as a Hired Employee upon his or
her return to, or commencement of active employment with, Buyer or its
Affiliates. For purposes of this Section 5.5(b), "comparable employment as a
successor employer" means such material terms and conditions as are necessary
to avoid a claim for severance benefits. Seller hereby acknowledges that
Buyer providing the terms and conditions described in clauses (i), (v) and
(vi) of this Section 5.5(b) and Section 5.5(c), as well as the same principal
work location and with substantially equivalent duties as in
effect immediately prior to the Transfer Date, will constitute "comparable
employment as a successor employer" as described herein.   

(i) For the period starting on the Transfer Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, each unrepresented Hired Employee shall be
entitled to receive while in the employ of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
the same or similar base salary or wage rate, and (to the extent any such
Hired Employee was provided incentive compensation and bonus opportunities by
Seller prior to the Transfer Date) amount of incentive compensation and bonus
opportunities as provided by Seller immediately prior to the Transfer Date.
In addition, Buyer shall provide each unrepresented Hired Employee, for the
period starting on the Transfer Date and ending on the first anniversary
of the Closing Date while in the employ of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, with substantially equivalent employee benefits having a
comparable aggregate employer-provided value to all benefits provided to such
individual under the applicable Seller Benefit Plans in effect immediately
prior to the Transfer Date; provided that (A) for purposes of this covenant,
stock options and other equity awards shall be disregarded and (B) this
provision does not oblige Buyer to provide defined benefit pension benefits
for such unrepresented Hired Employees. Seller acknowledges and agrees that
Buyers benefits program in the aggregate as disclosed to Seller and described
in Schedule 5.5(b)(i) satisfies the standard set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence.   

(ii) The employment of the unrepresented Hired Employees will be "at-
will."   

(iii) Effective as of the Transfer Date, Buyer will offer employment to all
represented Business Employees under the terms and conditions outlined in the
Collective Bargaining Agreement identified on Section 3.15(g) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule with any labor organization representing Business
Employees. Effective on the Transfer Date, Buyer will assume the
Collective Bargaining Agreement set forth in Section 3.15(g) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and all represented Business Employees shall be treated
as Hired Employees. Buyer shall establish a new defined benefit pension plan
(the "Buyers Pension Plan") that would have the same benefit multiplier and
other terms and conditions regarding vesting and eligibility to participate
and receive benefits that are the same as those contained in the GE
Mechanical Systems-Los Angeles Pension Plan for UAW Local 509 Hourly
Employees ("GE Local 509 Plan") in such manner as to comply with the
Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to employment on and after the
Transfer Date; provided, however, that Seller agrees to amend the GE Local
509 Plan effective on and after the Transfer Date to treat Buyer and any
member of a group under common control with Buyer for purposes of Section
414(b) or (c) of the Code as an "Employer" solely with respect to determining
the eligibility of any represented Hired Employees on or after the Transfer
Date for a disability retirement pension under the GE Local 509 Plan. Buyer
shall also, for the duration of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement
on and after the Transfer Date, make employer matching contributions under a
plan qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code with respect
to represented Hired Employees at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of
compensation contributed to such plan by any such employee.   

(iv) Effective as of the Transfer Date, Seller shall pay any Hired Employee
the appropriate accrued amounts of sick leave pay, vacation pay or other paid
time off of such Hired Employees, as required by applicable Law.   

(v) Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall or shall
cause its Affiliates to, provide severance benefits to any unrepresented
Hired Employee who is laid off or made redundant or during the period
starting on the Transfer Date and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date in an amount that is equal to the severance benefits
(including severance payments, transition payments and continued health
coverage) that the employee would have been entitled to pursuant to and under
circumstances consistent with the terms of the applicable Seller Benefit
Plans as in effect on the Closing Date.   

(vi) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, waive limitations on
benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions of the Hired Employees and
their eligible spouses and dependents (but only to the extent such pre-
existing condition limitations were waived under the Seller Benefit Plans as
of the Transfer Date). Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under
their health plans applicable to Hired Employees, deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses paid by Hired Employees and their respective spouses and
dependents under Sellers or any of its Affiliates health plans in
2013.   

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the Employee Services Agreement, Hired
Employees will cease active participation in any Seller Benefit Plan (other
than the Assumed Plans) and will commence participation in employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements offered by Buyer (" _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ")
effective as of 11:59 p.m. local time on the day immediately before
the Transfer Date. Such Hired Employees will be given credit under Buyer
Benefit Plans for all service prior to the Transfer Date with Seller (to the
extent credit was given by Seller) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and,
to the extent applicable, calculation of vacation or other paid time off, or
severance benefits; provided, however, that such service will not be credited
for purposes of benefit accruals under any such Buyer Benefit Plans (other
than for vacation, other paid time off or severance benefits).   

(d) Seller has satisfied its obligation under applicable labor law with
respect to represented Business Employees regarding the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has not received any request
on behalf of such represented Business Employees to engage in any bargaining
relating to such contemplated transactions.   

(e) Effective as of the Transfer Date, Buyer shall assume sponsorship of and
all obligations under, liabilities with respect to, and assets (if any) with
respect to, the Seller Benefit Plans set forth on Section 5.5(e) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Assumed Plans_ ") provided, however, that
Seller will remain responsible for (i) any uninsured liabilities under the
Assumed Plans applicable to individuals who as of the Closing Date are former
employees of Seller and (ii) any claims incurred and unpaid under the Assumed
Plans prior to the Closing with respect to any self-insured Assumed Plan.
Seller shall take all actions necessary to transfer such sponsorship
and assets (if any) to Buyer as of the Transfer Date and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection therewith. Prior to the
Transfer Date, Seller shall cause the members of any committee charged with
administrative and/or fiduciary responsibility with respect to any of
the Assumed Plans to relinquish their membership in such committee effective
as of the Transfer Date. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
appoint all administrators, fiduciaries and others responsible for the
Assumed Plans on and after the Transfer Date.   

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall (i) confer any rights upon any person,
including any current or former employees of the Seller, other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii)
constitute or create an employment agreement, or (iii) constitute or be
treated as the amendment, modification or adoption of any employee benefit
plan of the Seller or any of its Affiliates.   

5.6 _GE FSA Plans_. With respect to any Hired Employee who was a participant
during 2013 in a health or dependent care flexible spending account plan
maintained by GE or one of its Affiliates (collectively, the " _GE FSA Plans_
"): (i) if Buyer or one of its Affiliates maintains a general purpose health
flexible spending account plan (a " _GPHFSA Plan_ "), Buyer shall, or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to, effect a FSA Transfer (as defined
below) of the Hired Employees account (if any) under the GE GPHFSA Plan to
the GPHFSA Plan of Buyer or one of its Affiliates; (ii) if Buyer or one of
its Affiliates maintains a limited purpose health flexible spending
account plan (a " _LPHFSA Plan_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, effect a FSA Transfer (as defined below) of the Hired
Employees account (if any) under the GE LPHFSA Plan to the LPHFSA Plan of
Buyer or one of its Affiliates; and (iii) if Buyer or one of its Affiliates
maintains a dependent care flexible spending account plan (a " _DCFSA Plan_
"), Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, effect a FSA
Transfer (as defined below) of the Hired Employees account (if any) under
the GE DCFSA Plan to the DCFSA Plan of Buyer or one of its Affiliates. For
purposes of this Section 5.6, a " _FSA Transfer_ " involves Buyer or one of
its Affiliates (i) effectuating the election of the Hired Employee in effect
under the applicable GE FSA Plans immediately prior to the Transfer Date and
(ii) assuming responsibility for administering and paying under the
applicable plans of Buyer or one of its Affiliates all eligible reimbursement
claims of the Hired Employee incurred in the calendar year in which the
Transfer Date occurs that are submitted for payment on or after the Transfer
Date, whether such claims arose before, on or after the Transfer Date.
As soon as practicable following the Transfer Date, GE shall cause to be
transferred to Buyer an amount in cash equal to (i) the sum of all
contributions to the applicable GE FSA Plans made with respect to the
calendar year in which the Transfer Date occurs by or on behalf of the
Hired Employee prior to the Transfer Date, reduced by (ii) the sum of all
claims incurred by the Hired Employee under the applicable GE FSA Plans in
the calendar year in which the Transfer Date occurs that are submitted for
payment prior to the Transfer Date.   

5.7 _[ Reserved]_.   

5.8 _Transfer Date_. Buyer will have the obligation and liability for any
workers compensation or similar workers protection claims of any Hired
Employee that are incurred on or after the Transfer Date, as allocated to
Buyer in accordance with applicable Law. Buyer shall not assume or otherwise
have any liability for workers compensation or similar workers
protection claims of any Hired Employee that are allocated to Seller under
applicable law, and Seller shall be responsible for such claims.   

5.9 _WARN Act_. Seller will provide any notices to terminated employees that
may be required under any applicable law, including the WARN Act, with
respect to events that occur up to and on the Transfer Date. Buyer will
provide any notices to any terminated employees that may be required under
any applicable Law, including the WARN Act, with respect to events that occur
after the Transfer Date.   

5.10 _Assignment of Certain Purchased Assets_.   

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to convey, assign, transfer
or deliver to Buyer any Contract or Permit or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted conveyance,
assignment, transfer or delivery thereof, or an agreement to do any of
the foregoing, without the Consent of a third party (including any
Governmental Entity), would constitute a breach or other contravention
thereof or a violation of Law or would in any way adversely affect the rights
of Buyer (as assignee or transferee of Seller, or otherwise) thereto
or thereunder. Subject to the last sentence of Section 5.3(a)(iv) and except
as set forth on Section 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent necessary for
the conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of any such Contract or
Permit, claim, right or benefit to Buyer. If, on the Closing Date, any such
consent is not obtained, or if an attempted conveyance, assignment, transfer
or delivery thereof or performance thereof by Buyer would be ineffective or a
violation of Law or would adversely affect the rights of Buyer thereto or
thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, Seller
and Buyer will cooperate in a mutually acceptable arrangement under which
Buyer would, in compliance with Law, obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with such Contract or
Permit, claim, right or benefit in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer, or under which Seller
would enforce for the benefit (and at the expense) of Buyer any and all of
its rights against a third party (including any Governmental Entity)
associated with such Purchased Asset, claim, right or benefit (collectively,
" _Third Party Rights_ "), and Seller would promptly pay to Buyer when
received all monies received by them under any such Contract or Permit,
claim, right or benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Contract or
Permit shall be conveyed, assigned, transferred and delivered to Buyer upon
receipt of the requisite consent unless such attempted
contribution, conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof would be
ineffective or a violation of Law or would adversely affect the rights of
Buyer.   

(b) Where the Consent of a third party (including any Governmental Entity) is
required to assign or novate a Government Contract to Buyer, until such time
as the parties obtain the necessary Consent for such assignment or novation,
Buyer shall perform as a subcontractor to Seller any and all obligations and
provide any and all services and other performance obligations, including
requirements to comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, under
such Government Contract. Buyer agrees to pay, perform and discharge and
indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any obligation and liability of
Seller arising after the Closing Date and relating to such performance or
failure to perform under such Government Contracts after the Closing
Date, without derogation, however, of Buyers indemnity rights under Article
IX.   

(c) Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Shared Contracts shall not constitute
Purchased Assets and shall not be assigned by Seller or any of its Affiliates
to Buyer. With respect to any Shared Contract, Seller shall, following the
date hereof and continuing after the Closing Date, cooperate with Buyer in
any reasonable manner in connection with Buyers efforts to, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to, obtain the agreement of the other
party or parties to any such Shared Contract to enter into a separate
agreement (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer) with Buyer
with respect to the matters covered by such Shared Contract pertaining to
the Business; provided, that subject to compliance with the foregoing, none
of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall have any liability to Buyer under
this Agreement arising out of or relating to Buyers (or its Affiliates)
failure to obtain any such separate agreement. If, on the Closing Date, such
separate agreement between Buyer and the other party or parties to such Shared
Contract is not obtained, Seller and Buyer will cooperate in a mutually
acceptable arrangement under which Buyer would, in compliance with Law and
such Shared Contracts, obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and
bear the economic burdens associated with that portion of each such Shared
Contract that pertains to the Business, in accordance with this Agreement,
including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer; provided, that
subject to compliance with the foregoing, none of Seller or any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability to Buyer under this Agreement arising out
of or relating to Buyers (or its Affiliates) inability to provide the
benefits and the obligations of the applicable portion of any such Shared
Contract to Buyer. To the extent that any Liability related to any Shared
Contract arises after the Closing out of the negligent or wrongful acts or
omissions of Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or its
Affiliates on the other hand, then the party causing the Liability will
indemnify and hold the other party harmless from and against any such
Liability. Nothing contained in Section 5.10 shall affect, prejudice, reduce,
modify or foreclose Buyers indemnification rights under Article IX for breach
by Seller of any representation or warranty contained in Article III or the
covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.3(b).   

5.11 _Intercompany Obligations_. Seller shall take such action and make, or
cause to be made, such payments as may be necessary so that, as of the
Closing Date, there shall be no Intercompany Accounts Receivable or
Intercompany Accounts Payable (other than Intercompany Trade Receivables,
Intercompany Trade Payables or obligations or rights pursuant to Business
Contracts set forth on Section 5.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) in
effect or outstanding.   

5.12 _Non-Solicitation_.   

(a) Seller acknowledges that each of the Business Employees possesses
confidential information pertaining to the Business. During the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is one year after
the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), GE Aviation, including
any Controlled Subsidiary within GE Aviation, will not (i) directly or
indirectly, solicit the employment of or hire any Hired Employees or (ii)
induce, solicit or encourage any other Affiliate of Seller, including GE, to
directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of or hire any
Hired Employees, but only for so long as such Hired Employees are employed by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer.   

(b) During the Restricted Period neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
controlled by Buyer will, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of
or hire any officer or key employee of Seller or its Affiliates (other than
Hired Employees) with whom, or to whom, Buyer or its Affiliates were
introduced to or became in contact with in connection with the sale of the
Business (other than Hired Employees), but only for so long as such officer
or employee is employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates.   

(c) The phrase "solicit the employment of" (or, other than with respect to any
person listed on Section 5.12(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, any
hiring resulting from such solicitation) shall not be deemed to include
general solicitations of employment not directed toward employees of Seller,
Buyer or their respective Affiliates.   

5.13 _Non-Competition_.   

(a) During the Non-Compete Period and in the Restricted Region, neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates controlled by, or forming a part of, GE Aviation
will (i) manage, operate, engage in, or own directly or indirectly any Equity
Interests in any Person engaged in (A) the Business or (B) the business of
designing, developing, operating, manufacturing, marketing, servicing and
selling thrust reverser actuation systems (a " _TRAS Business_ "), or (ii)
actively assist any other party to compete with Buyer in the Business or in a
TRAS Business.   

(b) For the purpose of this Section 5.13, "Buyer" will include its
subsidiaries, divisions and Affiliates as they may exist from time to time,
and its successors and assigns, including any Person succeeding to title to
the goodwill of the Business or the Purchased Assets from Buyer.   

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 5.13(a), and without
implicitly agreeing that the following activities would be subject to the
provisions of Section 5.13(a), nothing in this Agreement shall preclude,
prohibit or restrict Seller or any other Person that is a part of GE Aviation
from engaging in any manner in any (i) Financial Services Business,
(ii) Existing Business Activities, (iii) De Minimis Business or (iv) business
activity that would otherwise violate Section 5.13(a) that is acquired from
any Person (an " _After-Acquired Business_ ") or is carried on by any Person
that is acquired by or combined with Seller or any of their Affiliates in
each case after the Closing (an " _After-Acquired Company_ "); provided that
with respect to this clause (iv), so long as within eighteen (18) months
after the consummation of the purchase or other acquisition of the After-
Acquired Business or the After-Acquired Company, Seller or such other Person,
as applicable, signs a definitive agreement to dispose of, and subsequently
disposes of, the relevant portion of the business or securities of the After-
Acquired Business or the After-Acquired Company or at the expiration of such
eighteen (18) month period the business of the After-Acquired Business or the
After-Acquired Company complies with this Section 5.13; provided however,
that no such disposition shall be required to the extent the revenue from the
competing portion of the business of the After-Acquired Business or After-
Acquired Company is less than both (a) $15,000,000 and (b) 15% of the
aggregate revenue of such After-Acquired Business or After-Acquired Company
for the fiscal year immediately preceding the measurement date.   

(d) If at any time the provisions of this Section 5.13 will be determined to
be invalid or unenforceable, by reason of being vague or unreasonable as to
area, duration or scope of activity, this Section 5.13 will be considered
divisible and will become and be immediately amended to only such area,
duration and scope of activity as will be determined to be reasonable and
enforceable by the court or other body having jurisdiction over the matter;
and this Section 5.13 as so amended will be valid and binding as though any
invalid or unenforceable provision had not been included herein.   

5.14 _Seller Support Arrangements_. From and after the date hereof, the
parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
termination of, and full release of Seller and its Affiliates from any and
all obligations arising under, the Seller Support Arrangements. To the extent
necessary to facilitate the termination of the Seller Support Arrangements,
Buyer (or a Subsidiary or other Affiliate of Buyer) will use commercially
reasonable efforts to substitute its own obligations for those of Seller and
its Affiliates under any Seller Support Arrangement as soon as reasonably
practicable without derogation of Buyers indemnity rights under Article
IX. Following Closing, Buyer will indemnify Seller and its Affiliates from
any Liabilities that are not Excluded Liabilities under any Seller Support
Arrangement.   

5.15 [ _Reserved_ ].   

5.16 _"Wrong Pockets" Assets Covenant_.   

(a) Following the Closing, if any assets, including Intellectual Property,
Intellectual Property agreements, IT Assets, mail, payment of receivables or
other communications, Related to the Business or related to the Purchased
Assets, have not, but should have, been included in the Purchased Assets or
conveyed at Closing (" _Omitted Assets_ "), Seller will transfer, or cause to
be transferred, such Omitted Assets to Buyer or its designated assignee.
Pending such transfer, Seller will hold such Omitted Assets and provide to
Buyer or its designated assignee all of the benefits (including any amounts
paid to Seller or its Affiliates in respect thereof) associated with the
ownership thereof, and Seller will cause such Omitted Assets to be used or
retained as may be reasonably instructed by Buyer.   

(b) Following the Closing, if any Excluded Assets, including mail, payment of
receivables or other communications have, but should not have, been included
in the Purchased Assets or conveyed at Closing (" _Extra Assets_ "), Buyer
will transfer, or cause to be transferred, such Extra Assets to Seller or its
designated assignee. Pending such transfer, Buyer will hold such Extra Assets
and provide to Seller or its designated assignee all of the benefits
(including any amounts paid to Buyer or its Affiliates in respect thereof)
associated with the ownership thereof, and Buyer will cause such Extra Assets
to be used or retained as may be reasonably instructed by Seller.   

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, if, following the Closing Date, (a) Buyer
receives any monies constituting Excluded Assets, Buyer will promptly endorse
or pay such amounts over to Seller, and (b) Seller receives any monies

5.17 _Further Assurances_. Each of Seller and Buyer (i) shall execute and
deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, such documents and
other papers and shall take, or shall cause to be taken, such further actions
as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including in the case of Seller to cause its Affiliates to
execute and deliver such transfer documents as may be necessary to vest title
to the Purchased Assets in Buyer, or to re-title any incorrectly titled
assets or liabilities) and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) shall refrain
from taking any actions that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
impede the Closing in any material respect.   

5.18 [ _Reserved_ ].   

5.19 _Title and Survey_.   

(a) Seller shall have the responsibility to obtain and deliver to Buyer no
later than five days prior to the Closing, at Sellers sole cost and expense,
an Updated Title Commitment with respect to the Owned Real Property. In
addition, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all
underlying documents for the encumbrances evidenced by the Updated Title
Commitments no later than five days prior to the Closing. The Updated Title
Commitment will evidence a commitment to issue a Title Policy insuring good
and valid fee simple title to each of the Owned Real Properties subject to no
Liens other than Permitted Liens.   

(b) Buyer may, at its option, obtain an Updated Survey with respect to the
Owned Real Property. Seller shall provide Buyer with any existing surveys of
the Owned Real Property in its possession. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer
in obtaining the Updated Surveys, provided that Seller shall not be required
to incur any cost, expense or liability in connection with the
Updated Survey.   

5.20 _Insurance_.   

(a) From and after the Closing Date, except to the extent provided in Section
5.20(b), the Business shall cease to be insured by, have access or
availability to, be entitled to make claims on, be entitled to claim benefits
from or seek coverage under any of GEs or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
insurance policies or any of their self-insured programs (for purposes of this
Section, hereinafter "GE" shall include, where appropriate to the context,
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates).   

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.20(a), with respect to any claim, act, omission,
event, circumstance, occurrence or loss that occurred or existed prior to the
Closing Date relating to the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities,
Transferred Employees, former employees or Inactive Employees that either (i)
would be covered by GEs occurrence-based general liability,
aviation liability or employers liability insurance policies (or comparable
occurrence-based country programs) (collectively, the " _Available Insurance
Policies_ ") or (ii) was properly reported to GEs insurer prior to the
Closing Date (items described by clause (i) or (ii) above, each a "
_Covered Insurance Matter_ "), Buyer may access, make claims on, claim
benefits from and/or seek coverage and recovery under such policies and
programs subject to the terms and conditions of such policies and programs
and this Agreement, provided that:    

(i) Buyer shall notify both GEs and its own Corporate Insurance departments
in advance of all such claims and/or efforts to seek benefits or coverage and
shall cooperate with GE in pursing all such claims, provided that Buyer shall
be solely responsible for notifying any and all insurance companies of such
claims and complying with all policy conditions for such claims. GE shall
have the right but not the duty to monitor and/or associate with coverage
claims or requests for benefits asserted by Buyer under the Available
Insurance Policies, including the coverage positions and arguments asserted
therein, provided that Buyer shall not, without the written consent of GE,
(a) amend, modify or (except waivers specific to a Covered Insurance Matter
that could not affect GEs coverage or rights under any Available Insurance
Policy with respect to matters other than such Covered Insurance Matter)
waive any rights under any Available Insurance Policies, or (b) assign the
Available Insurance Policies or any rights or claims under the Available
Insurance Policies.    

(ii) To the extent necessary to obtain coverage for a Covered Insurance
Matter, Buyer may request that GE make and pursue, and upon such request GE
shall make and use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue, any claims
related to such Covered Insurance Matter under the Available Insurance
Policies on Buyers behalf. GE agrees to pursue such claims consistent with
its past practice and the manner in which it pursues comparable insurance
claims for its businesses other than the Business. In connection with
the reporting and administrative handling of such claims, GE shall consult
with, and reasonably consider the comments provided by, Buyer. Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with GE in pursuing all such claims. GE shall remit
promptly to Buyer any recoveries it may so obtain under Available Insurance
Policies in respect of Covered Insurance Matters. Nothing herein shall
require GE to make or pursue any claim in the absence of a request by Buyer.
Without limiting any right of either party to seek indemnification thereof
under Article IX hereof, Buyer shall bear any expense incurred by GE in the
pursuit of any such claims (including an appropriate allocation of overhead
expenses). Without limiting any right of either party to seek indemnification
thereof under Article IX hereof, Buyer shall exclusively bear and be liable
(and neither GE nor Seller shall have any obligations to repay or reimburse
Buyer) for all deductibles and retentions and uninsured, uncovered,
unavailable or uncollectible amounts relating to or associated with such
clams, whether made by Buyer, its employees or third parties. Buyer shall
cooperate with GE and its affiliates and insurers with respect to the pursuit
of any rights of recovery against third parties with respect to
Covered Insurance Matters.    

(iii) Available Insurance Policies shall not include any of GEs claims-made
or occurrence-reported liability policies or GEs property, terrorism,
transit, and construction all risk insurance policies. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein, except to the extent provided in Section
5.20(b)(ii), GE shall retain exclusive right to control all of its insurance
policies and programs, including the Available Insurance Policies, and the
benefits and amounts payable thereunder, including the right to exhaust,
settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect
to any of its insurance policies and programs and to amend, modify or waive
any rights under any such insurance policies and programs, notwithstanding
whether any such policies or programs apply to any Liabilities and/or claims
Buyer has made or could make in the future with respect to the Business,
including coverage claims with respect to Covered Insurance
Matter(s). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing herein
shall require GE or any of its Affiliates to maintain or continue to maintain
any insurance coverage of any nature or covering any period of time. Buyer
shall cooperate with GE and share such information as is reasonably necessary
in order to permit GE to manage and conduct its insurance matters as GE deems
appropriate, and Buyer hereby gives consent for GE to inform any affected
insurer of this agreement and to provide such insurer with a copy
hereof.   

(c) At Closing, (i) Buyer is required to have in effect all insurance programs
to comply with any and all of the Business contractual and statutory
obligations and (ii) GE shall maintain on behalf of the Business the
statutorily mandated insurance with respect to Covered Insurance Matters and
only then for the minimum amount of insurance required.   

5.21 _Disclosure Schedule Updates_. Seller shall, prior to the Closing,
notify Buyer through the delivery of corrected, amended or supplemental
portions of the Seller Disclosure Schedule of Sellers Knowledge of any fact,
condition, matter or occurrence, whether existing before, on or after the
date of this Agreement, that (i) causes any of the Sellers
representations and warranties contained in Article III to be untrue or
inaccurate or (ii) constitutes or results in a breach of any covenant of
Seller (each, a " _Disclosure Letter Update_ "). No Disclosure Letter Update
will be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant herein contained and Buyer will have the right hereunder to make a
claim for indemnification for the facts, conditions, matters or occurrences
described in any Disclosure Letter Update (subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in Article IX, provided that the limitations set forth in
Sections 9.3(a), (c) or (d) shall not apply to any indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.1(a)(i) in respect of any matter required to be included in the
Disclosure Schedules Update with respect to which Seller has intentionally
breached this Section 5.21).   

5.22 _Assignment of Permits_. Seller shall, in accordance with applicable
Laws, use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer to Buyer any Business
Permits required to be held in connection with the operation of the
Business.   

5.23 _Product Warranty Work_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall perform, at
Sellers cost and expense, obligations under Warranty Contracts to repair or
replace Products shipped by Seller, or services performed by Seller, on or
prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall assume, pay and reimburse Buyer for
all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or its agents or representatives for
work performed in connection with such claims (the " _Warranty Claims_ ") to
the extent such work is required to be performed by the terms of the warranty
or other term of the applicable Contract of Seller and its Affiliates in
effect immediately prior to the Closing (" _Warranty Contracts_ "). If Seller
fails to reimburse Buyer for any worked performed in connection with any
Warranty Claims, Buyer may seek indemnification from Seller for this Excluded
Liability, as provided in Article IX, to the extent of the deficiency in such
reimbursement.   

5.24 _[ Reserved_].   

5.25 _Known Environmental Conditions_. With respect to the condition(s)
relating to the Owned Real Property described in Section 5.25 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (" _Known Environmental Conditions_ "), Seller shall, at
its sole cost and expense, investigate and remediate the Known Environmental
Conditions to the extent necessary to obtain a No Further Action
Status. Seller, subject to the prior review and reasonable approval of Buyer,
may determine the appropriate remedy, which may include the use of risk-based
remedies and engineering and institutional controls such as deed restrictions
as long as such measures do not prevent or unreasonably inhibit Buyers use
of the Owned Real Property for the conduct of the Business consistent with its
industrial use during the period covered by the 2012 Financials ("
_Institutional Controls_ "). From and after the Closing Date, and until
Buyers receipt from Seller of documentation indicating that No
Further Action Status has been obtained with respect to the Known
Environmental Conditions, Buyer shall provide the Seller, at mutually
agreeable times and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 9.3(c)(i)-(iv), access to the Owned Real Property so that Seller can
complete any investigation, remedial or other action required pursuant to
this Section 5.25, and shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining
the No Further Action Status consistent with Sellers obligations pursuant to
this Section, including consenting to any agreed upon Institutional Controls.
From and after the Closing Date, and until the Seller has delivered to Buyer
documentation indicating that No Further Action Status has been obtained with
respect to the Known Environmental Conditions, Buyer shall promptly notify
the Seller of any unpermitted Release of Hazardous Materials at, on, under
or from the Owned Real Property that may affect the Sellers activities
hereunder or that involve Hazardous Materials similar to those that have been
identified in connection with the Known Environmental Conditions. Upon Seller
obtaining No Further Action Status, Seller shall have no further obligation
to investigate or remediate the Known Environmental Conditions unless
further investigation or remediation with respect to the Known Environmental
Conditions is required by Environmental Law or subsequently is required by a
Governmental Entity. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein is intended
to mitigate or otherwise affect any right to indemnification that Buyer might
otherwise have for any other matter pursuant to Article IX hereof. In addition
to establishing the manner and method for addressing the Known Environmental
Condition, the information regarding the Known Environmental Condition is
being provided consistent with requirements of California Health and Safety
Code Section 25359.7.   

5.26 _Factored Receivables_.   

(a) Factoring Entity does not own or hold any Purchased Assets other than the
Factored Receivables and holds no Assumed Liabilities. Factoring Entity shall
not be deemed to have any obligations hereunder. GE shall cause the Factoring
Entity to enter into the Bill of Sale, pursuant to which it shall transfer to
Buyer at Closing the Factored Receivables.   

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Section 5.1_), Buyer and Seller have agreed that the Business
shall continue to securitize its receivables from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing in the ordinary course of business, and that Buyer shall
purchase the Factored Receivables from Factoring Entity at the Closing
pursuant to and in accordance with the Bill of Sale the consideration for
which is included in the Purchase Price.   

5.27 _Aviation Regulatory Compliance_. Within seven days after the Closing,
Seller shall furnish Buyer all data, drawings, procedures, specifications,
operations manuals, quality manuals, quality systems and any other
information, in each case to the extent not already located at the Duarte
Facility, reasonably requested by Buyer to enable Buyer to timely submit
its applications to the FAA pursuant to Title 49 of the United States Code
and Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations for: (a) the issuance of a
Repair Station Certificate pursuant to 14 CFR Part 145 and EASA Regulations
and (b) the issuance of Parts Manufacturer Approval and other
aviation regulatory approvals for all items listed in Sections 1.1, 3.10 and
3.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule pursuant to 14 CFR Part 21.   

5.28 _Condemnation Proceeding_. Buyer acknowledges that the Metro Gold Line
Foothill Extension Construction Authority (the " _Authority_ ") has begun
proceedings with respect to a proposed taking (the " _Proposed Condemnation_
") of a portion of the Owned Real Property (the " _Current Parking Lot_ ").
Following the Closing, Seller shall have the right to control all ongoing
proceedings in connection with the Proposed Condemnation, including the
retention of outside counsel, as if Buyer had delivered an Indemnification
Certificate to Seller with respect to the Proposed Condemnation, and Seller
shall have delivered an Assumption Notice with an Acknowledgement, to Buyer;
provided, however, that if the scope of the property subject to the Proposed
Condemnation expands beyond the Current Parking Lot or otherwise effect any
other portion of the Owned Real Property or the operations thereon, Seller
shall immediately notify Buyer and Seller shall not take any action
with respect to the Proposed Condemnation without the prior written consent
of Buyer to any decisions regarding the Proposed Condemnation or the
settlement thereof. Seller shall seek to obtain full, fair, and just
compensation from the Authority in return for the taking of the Current
Parking Lot (including negotiating with the Authority for a sale of the
property in lieu of such taking, in which case such sale shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions hereunder) and as a result of the Proposed
Condemnation; _provided_ that any such compensation shall be considered
an Excluded Asset hereunder. Buyer shall provide all reasonably necessary
support and access required by Seller or Sellers representatives to enable
Seller to negotiate a resolution of the compensation, at no cost to Buyer and
Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed as to the status of the Proposed
Condemnation and any negotiations with the Authority. No consent of Buyer
shall be required prior to the acceptance by Seller of any compensation offer
from the Authority, except as otherwise provided herein. To the extent
required, Buyer shall execute any and all such reasonable documents required
to accept a compensation offer, either by itself or by granting an
appropriate power of attorney to Seller or Sellers counsel. In anticipation
of the taking or purchase by the Authority of the Current Parking Lot, Buyer
shall develop plans (or leverage those plans already being established by
Seller) (the " _Plans_ ") for the construction of a replacement parking lot on
the Owned Real Property, as well as any additional capital work to the Owned
Real Property which is required by Law or is reasonably required in
connection with the replacement of the Current Parking Lot and the reasonable
establishment of such replacement parking lot for use on the Owned Property
and in all cases results directly from the taking by the Authority of the
Current Parking Lot or the construction of the replacement parking lot on the
Owned Property (collectively, the " _Work_ "). The Plans shall be accompanied
by a proposed budget (the " _Budget_ ") with respect to the Work. The Plans
and the Budget shall be subject to the review and approval by the Seller,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
_provided, however,_ that if Seller shall fail to approve or disapprove of
such Plans and Budget within forty-five (45) days after receipt thereof,
Seller shall be deemed to have consent to such Plans and Budget in the form
so submitted. The parties acknowledge and agree that as a result of the
anticipated timing of the Proposed Condemnation, Buyer shall have the right
to begin reasonable development of the Plans and Budget promptly after the
date of this Agreement and in the event the Proposed Condemnation (or
a settlement thereof that results in the taking of the Current Parking Lot)
is not consummated, Seller shall (i) promptly notify Buyer when Seller
becomes aware that the Current Parking Lot will not be sold or taken and (ii)
have the obligation to reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the preparation of the
Plans and Budget prior to the date Buyer receives such notice. The Work,
which shall be performed by the Buyer (or which Buyer shall cause to be
performed), shall conform in all material respects to the approved Plans and
Budget, provided that any material variances from either the Work or the
Budget shall be subject to Sellers further approval, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The contractor shall only use
materials which are of the same quality materials as is currently found at
the Current Parking Lot and at the Owned Real Property, provided that Seller
shall not be responsible for any materials or construction which is of a
higher quality than the materials currently used at the Parking Lot and Owned
Real Property. Buyer shall bid out the Work to no less than three
contractors, provided that Buyer shall keep Seller informed of all bids
received. Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining all permits and approvals
with respect to the Work. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
warranties from Sellers Contractors that are consistent with comparable work
in the construction industry. Following the completion of the Work, Seller
shall have the right to enter upon the Owned Real Property to inspect the Work
to verify that the Work was completed in a manner consistent with the Plans.
Seller shall indemnify Buyer with respect to all reasonable out of pocket
third party costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the Work
to the extent performed in compliance with this Section 5.27. Seller shall
pay Buyer such amounts no later than thirty (30) days after Buyers demand
therefor, which demand shall be accompanied by a written invoice detailing
the costs so expensed. Sellers indemnification obligations under this
Section 5.27 shall terminate upon the first to occur: (x) completion of the
Work in accordance with the Plans and payment by Seller in accordance with
the preceding sentence or (y) an announcement or other statement by the
Authority that it no longer plans to proceed with the taking.   

5.29 _Allocation of Pre-Closing Infringement Damages; Retained Right to Assert
Transferred IP_.   

(a) If, in any action to enforce the Transferred IP, Buyer receives any
damages or other compensation relating to infringement, violation,
misappropriation or other unauthorized use of the Transferred IP that
occurred prior to Closing (" _Pre-Closing Damages_ "), Buyer shall promptly
pay Seller such Pre-Closing Damages to Seller, minus an amount equal to the
percentage of the total costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in such action
(including attorney fees) corresponding to the percentage of the total
damages and other compensation relating to infringement,
violation, misappropriation or other unauthorized use of the Transferred IP
received by Buyer in such action that is represented by the Pre-Closing
Damages. For example, if in such an action Buyer were to receive $1,000 in
total damages and other compensation of which $500 are Pre-Closing Damages
and Buyer were to have incurred $750 in total costs and expenses, then the
amount to be paid by Buyer to Seller would be $500  ((500/1000) x $750) or
$125.   

(b) Following the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to assert claims of
infringement, violation, misappropriation or other unauthorized use of the
Transferred IP based on actions that occurred prior to Closing, but solely in
response to any claim or suit first brought by any Person against Seller or
its Affiliates for infringement, violation, misappropriation or unauthorized
use of Intellectual Property, provided, however, that Seller (i) shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing, prior to responding to such claim or suit
and (ii) shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any such claim
or suit that affects or concerns the validity, enforceability or ownership of
any Transferred IP without the prior written consent of Buyer, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   

5.30 _Supply Agreements_. Seller and Buyer hereby agree to the matters set
forth on Section 5.30 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

determined to seek indemnification under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a
third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim, demand or circumstance;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such Indemnification
Certificate shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is actually and prejudiced by such failure. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Indemnification Certificate or other notices for claims in
respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall be delivered (and no such claim should be made or brought)
after the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in Section
9.3(a) for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.   

(b) Upon receipt of an Indemnification Certificate for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a), with respect to any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of such claim and shall
allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver written notice of such election to the
Indemnified Party (an " _Assumption Notice_ "), which notice may contain an
acknowledgement of liability (an " _Acknowledgement_ ") to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to Losses relating to such Third Party Claim,
subject to the limitations on such liability set forth in this Article IX.
The Party that shall control the defense of any such Third Party Claim (the "
_Controlling Party_ ") shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of
recognized standing and competence after consultation with the other party
and shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or settlement of
such Third Party Claim. Each of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate
fully with the Controlling Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement or
compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim involving solely money damages without the consent of any
Indemnified Party, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or
cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement (subject to Sections
9.3 and 9.5, if applicable), (ii) not encumber any of the assets of
any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would
apply to, bind or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the
conduct of any Indemnified Partys business and (iii) obtain, as a condition
of any settlement or other resolution, a complete release of any
Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third Party Claim. In no event
shall an Indemnified Party consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the Indemnifying Party is the Controlling
Party and has complied with its obligations pursuant to this Section
9.2(b).   

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim (i) to the
extent that the object of such Third Party Claim is to obtain an injunction,
restraining order, declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief (including
criminal penalties) against the Indemnified Party, (ii) if the named parties
to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the former shall
have been advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the Indemnifying
Party) that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available
to them that are different from or additional to those available to
Indemnifying Party, or any other conflict, or (iii) if such action or
proceeding involves, or could reasonably be expected to involve, Liability
that would constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the business
of the Indemnified Party; provided, further, that to exercise such rights the
Indemnifying Party must give notice to the Indemnified Person within 30 days
after receipt of any Indemnification Certificate whether it is assuming
control of and appointing lead counsel for such defense. If the Indemnifying
Party does not give such notice within such 30-day period, or does not
diligently defend the claim therefore, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to assume control of the defense thereof at the cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party, with periodic reimbursement of expenses, subject to
the limitations of Liability and other limits set forth in this Article
IX.   

(d) " _Defense Costs_ " means all costs and expenses, including reasonable
legal fees, filing fees and costs of investigation, incurred in connection
with defense of the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party with respect
to a Third Party Claim. This subsection (d) sets forth the default allocation
of Defense Costs solely to the extent Buyer and Seller cannot agree as to
which party shall bear responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim or
ultimate liability in respect of such Third Party Claim and, as a result,
each of Buyer and Seller retains its own counsel in respect of such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will each
pay their respective Defense Costs in connection with any Third Party Claim,
except, if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-
Party Claim with respect to which it has received an Indemnification
Certificate or it does not include an Acknowledgement in its
Assumption Notice, then the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified
Party for (i) the amount of the Indemnified Partys Defense Costs (and, in
the event the Indemnifying Party delivers such Acknowledgment, only such
amount of Defense Costs up to the date on which an Acknowledgement
is delivered to the Indemnified Party) multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (A)
the amount payable or paid by the Indemnifying Party in settlement or awarded
in a final, non-appealable judgment pursuant to any indemnity claim asserted
by the Indemnified Party under this Article IX with respect to such Third-
Party Claim (excluding any Defense Costs), divided by (B) the
aggregate amount payable or paid in settlement or awarded in a final, non-
appealable judgment by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party to
any third party with respect to such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the quotient determined in accordance with clause (ii) is
less than 0.5, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for
reimbursement of any portion of the Indemnified Partys Defense Costs.   

9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.   

(a) The indemnification obligations of the parties hereto under:   

(i) Section 9.1(a)(i) (other than for any breach of Sections 3.1(a), 3.2(a),
3.2(b)(i)(A) and (B), 3.2(b)(ii), 3.6, the second sentence of Section 3.8,
the first sentence of Section 3.10(c) or Section 3.20 (collectively, the "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") or Sections 3.3, 3.5, 3.7(a) or the first
sentence of Section 3.10(d)) and Section 9.1(b)(i) (other than for any breach
of Sections 4.1(a) or 4.2(a)) will survive until the date that is 18 months
after the Closing Date;   

(ii) Section 9.1(a)(i) with respect to any breach of Sections 3.5 will survive
until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extensions or waivers thereof);   

(iii) Section 9.1(a)(i) with respect to any breach of Section 3.7(a), the
first sentence of Section 3.10(d), a Fundamental Representation, Section
9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv), Section 9.1(a)(v), Section 9.1(b)(i) with
respect to any breach of Sections 4.1 or 4.2, and Section 9.1(b)(iii) will
survive indefinitely; and   

(iv) Sections 9.1(a)(ii) and 9.1(b)(ii), with respect to (A) covenants and
agreements of the parties hereto contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Closing, shall survive until the first to occur of three years
after the final date of required performance of such covenant if specified
herein, or the statute of limitations applicable to any breach of such
covenants and agreements and (B) covenants and agreements of the parties
hereto that by their terms apply or are to be performed at or prior to the
Closing shall survive until the date that is 18 months after the
Closing.   

(the applicable date for each representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
being the " _Indemnification Expiration Date_ "); provided that, in each
case, all such obligations will survive with respect to, and to the extent
of, any claim for which an Indemnification Certificate will have been
delivered to the Indemnifying Party prior to the applicable Indemnification
Expiration Date until such claim will have been finally resolved in
accordance with the terms of this Article IX. A Buyer Indemnified Partys
knowledge, prior to the Closing Date, of any inaccuracy in, or breach or non-
fulfillment of, any representation, warranty or covenant made by Seller
hereunder will not derogate such Buyer Indemnified Partys rights or remedies
after the Closing with respect to indemnification by Seller in respect of any
such inaccuracy, breach or non-fulfillment; provided, however, that this
sentence shall not apply if and to the extent that a Buyer Indemnified Party
has knowledge as of the date of this Agreement of a breach of Sellers
representations and warranties based upon information not known by Seller or
its Affiliates.   

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party under Section
9.1(a)(i) as to matters arising under Section 3.17 or under Section
9.1(a)(iii) as to matters relating to Section 2.4(i) and 2.4(j) (an "
_Environmental Loss_ ") to the extent that such Environmental Loss results
from, and would not have arisen but for: (i) any environmental sampling,
testing or remediation of soil, surface water, or groundwater in, at, on,
under or within any portion of the Real Property, (" _Environmental Activity_
") conducted by, on behalf of, at the direction of, or allowed by, any Buyer
Indemnified Party after the Closing Date other than: (A) in response to an
immediate, imminent and substantial threat to human health or the
Environment; (B) required by a relevant Governmental Entity; (C) required by
applicable Environmental Law or Environmental Permit issued thereunder; (D)
necessary in connection with any bona fide construction or expansion of the
improvements or necessary utility or maintenance activities at the Owned Real
Property; (E) necessary to defend a claim by a third party against any Buyer
Indemnified Party; (F) agreed to in writing by Seller (including with respect
to the Known Environmental Conditions); (G) in connection with the eminent
domain proceeding disclosed on Section 3.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;
or (H) as undertaken by a bona fide prospective purchaser who has signed a
contract with any Buyer Indemnified Party for the transfer of the Owned Real
Property or any portion thereof, provided that Buyer used
commercially reasonable efforts to contractually obligate such prospective
purchaser to agree to the same or substantially similar restrictions on
Environmental Activity as agreed to by Buyer in Section 9.3(b)(i) (A)-(G)
hereof (but without regard to Buyers ability to successfully obligate
a prospective purchaser to agree to such restrictions on Environmental
Activity after using commercially reasonable efforts); (ii) a material change
in the use of the Owned Real Property on or after the Closing Date to a non-
industrial use except for any change in use that may occur in connection with
activities contemplated by the eminent domain proceeding disclosed on Section
3.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; (iii) conducting any investigation or
remediation of soil and/or groundwater at the Real Property beyond the
minimum applicable standards acceptable to the relevant Governmental Entity
or required under Environmental Law; or (iv) any negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of any Buyer Indemnified Party after the
Closing Date that exacerbates any environmental condition, including the
presence of Hazardous Materials, at the Owned Real Property existing prior to
the Closing Date (including the Known Environmental Conditions),
provided, however, that in the case of 9.3(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv), Sellers
indemnity obligations shall be reduced and/or negated only to the extent that
the Environmental Loss is attributable to such change in use, amount such
investigation or remediation is above minimum applicable standards, or such
exacerbation. Furthermore, Seller acknowledges that it may not assert that a
Buyer Indemnified Party is in breach of its duty to mitigate under Section
9.6 by virtue of such Buyer Indemnified Party failing to undertake any
environmental sampling or testing of the Environment in circumstances where
9.3(b)(i)(A)-(H) do not apply.   

(c) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.2 with respect to third party
claims, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to direct,
manage and control any Environmental Activity at the Owned Real Property that
is necessary to address an Environmental Loss subject to indemnification
hereunder, provided, however, that Seller shall have first notified Buyer
in writing of Sellers acceptance of its responsibility to indemnify Buyer
for such Environmental Loss. Notwithstanding whether Seller elects to control
the Environmental Activity as provided for in this Section, the party
conducting such activity shall provide the other party with reasonable notice
and opportunity to review, comment, and reasonably participate in and approve
of any such Environmental Activity or related communications with
Governmental Entities. To the extent that Seller elects to conduct any
Environmental Activity as provided hereunder, Buyer shall provide Seller with
reasonable access to the Owned Real Property to conduct such Environmental
Activity, provided that Seller: (i) comply with applicable Laws (including
Environmental Laws); (ii) carry out such activities in a manner that will not
unreasonably interfere with the Business or the Buyers operations at the
Owned Real Property; (iii) restore the Owned Real Property to a substantially
similar condition as existed immediately prior to Seller undertaking any
such Environmental Activity; and (iv) furnish or cause to be furnished to
Buyer certificates of insurance evidencing reasonable and customary coverage
maintained by Sellers agents, employees, independent contractors or
consultants conducting any Environmental Activity at the Owned
Real Property.   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article IX, and
except for claims relating to breaches of Section 3.5 or the Fundamental
Representations, Seller will not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party in respect of any claim of any Buyer Indemnified Party for
any breach of a representation or warranty under Section 9.1(a)(i) unless the
aggregate dollar amount of all Losses in respect of such claim equals or
exceeds the Basket Amount, in which event Seller will be liable for all
Losses resulting from such claim.   

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event will the amount payable by Seller or its Affiliates for
indemnification for any and all claims relating to breaches of
representations or warranties under Section 9.1(a)(i) (except for claims
relating to breaches of Sections 3.5, 3.7(a), the first sentence of Section
3.10(d) or the Fundamental Representations) in the aggregate exceed 20% of
the Purchase Price (the " _Cap Amount_ ").   

(f) An Indemnified Party will not be entitled under this Agreement to multiple
recoveries for the same Losses.   

(g) In connection with an alleged breach of Sellers representations and
warranties under this Agreement, Losses will be net of any specified reserves
or Liabilities in respect of the subject matter of such breach established on
the Final Closing Working Capital Statement pursuant to Sections 2.5 through
2.9.   

(h) With respect to indemnification contained in Section 9.1(a)(i) of this
Agreement (i) each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis,
(ii) all Losses shall be net of any third-party insurance proceeds that have
been recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of indemnification; _provided_ such netting does
not conflict with or violate any insurance policy, insurance Contract or
insurance program, (iii) Seller shall have no liability to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses caused by or resulting
from any action (A) expressly required by, and performed in accordance
with, Section 5.1, or (B) for which Buyer has provided its prior written
consent executed by the General Counsel of Buyer (including pursuant to
Section 5.1) or (C) that Seller does not take as a result of Buyer
unreasonably withholding its consent pursuant to Section 5.1.   

(i) If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment for any Losses suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of this Article
IX, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to any insurance
benefits of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses and with respect
to the claim giving rise to such Losses; _provided_ such subrogation does not
conflict with or violate any insurance policy, insurance Contract or
insurance program.   

9.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law, all payments made with respect to the rights of indemnity under Article
IX will be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes.   

9.5 _Certain Damages; Sole Remedy_. Except with respect to claims of fraud or
Third Party Claims under Section 9.2, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Seller nor Buyer will be liable
to or otherwise responsible to any Indemnified Party or any other Person for
(a) any special, indirect or other damages, in each case that are remote or
speculative, not reasonably foreseeable or do not flow proximately from the
underlying breach or (b) punitive or exemplary damages, in each case in
respect of a given breach of a representation or covenant. Except with
respect to the matters covered by Sections 2.5 through 2.9 and other than
with respect to any equitable remedies, or fraud, Seller and Buyer acknowledge
and agree that the indemnification provisions of Sections 5.10(b), 5.14,
5.17(b) and 9.1 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies after the Closing of
any Seller Indemnified Party and any Buyer Indemnified Party, respectively,
for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that it
may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in
connection with, any breach of any representation or warranty in this
Agreement by Buyer or the Seller, respectively, or any failure by Buyer or
Seller, respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement set
forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise
have or to which they may become entitled.   

9.6 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.   

9.7 _Third Party Remedies_. If any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
is at any time entitled (whether by reason of a contractual right, a right to
take or bring a legal action, availability of insurance, or a right to
require a payment discount or otherwise, provided that no such obligation
exists to the extent that it would violate any subrogation or similar clause
in any insurance policies, insurance Contract or insurance programs) to
recover from another Person any amount in respect of any matter giving rise
to a Loss (whether before or after a payment has been made to an Indemnified
Party hereunder and in respect thereof), the Indemnified Party shall
(and shall cause its applicable Affiliate to) (a) promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party and provide such information as the Indemnifying Party may
require relating to such right of recovery and the steps taken or to be taken
by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith, including by assigning any
such rights to the Indemnifying Party if possible and to the extent necessary
to enable the Indemnifying Party to enforce such rights, (b) if so required
by the Indemnifying Party (subject to the Indemnified Party being indemnified
to its reasonable satisfaction by the Indemnifying Party against all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party
in respect thereof), take commercially reasonable steps as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably require to pursue such recovery, and (c) keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any action taken in
respect thereof. If an Indemnified Party recovers any amounts in respect of
Losses from any third party at any time after the Indemnifying Party has paid
all or a portion of such Losses to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over
to the Indemnifying Party the amount so received (to the extent of amounts
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party).   

9.8 _Effect of Government and Third Party Consents_. Nothing set forth in any
consent, waiver, novation or similar instrument (a) executed and delivered by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to any Person, including a Governmental
Entity, or (b) executed and delivered to or by any Person (including a
Governmental Entity, Aircelle, Boeing, or Seller), whether or not Buyer is an
express signatory, including the Aircelle Settlement or the Boeing Consent,
shall affect, prejudice, reduce, modify or foreclose Buyers indemnification
rights under this Article IX or the provisions of Sections 2.3 or 2.4 of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.8 shall not affect
information disclosed to Buyer in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or the
effect of such disclosure, in each case pursuant to, and for purposes of,
Article III.   

ARTICLE X    

TAX MATTERS    

10.1 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller
and Buyer shall each be liable for one half of any transfer, gains, sales,
use, stock transfer and stamp taxes, recording, registration and other fees,
and any other similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "). The parties will cooperate with each other in connection
with the filing of any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including
allowing each party to review and approve the Tax Returns and related data
prior to filing such Tax Returns and joining in the execution of any such Tax
Return or other documentation where necessary. Seller and Buyer will, upon
request of the other party, use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Tax. The party required by Law
to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall timely
prepare, with the other parties cooperation, and file such Tax Return.
If Seller files any such Tax Return, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller
for one half of any Transfer Taxes paid by Seller in connection with the
filing of such Tax Return. If Buyer files any such Tax Return, Seller shall
promptly reimburse Buyer for one half of any Transfer Taxes paid by Buyer in
connection with the filing of such Tax Return.   

10.2 _Bulk Sales Laws_. The parties hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of any tax clearance procedures, bulk sales, bulk transfer or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with
respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer.   

10.3 _Predecessor-Successor Reporting for Federal Tax Purposes_. Seller and
Buyer agree to comply with the Standard Procedure described in Section 4 of
Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320, pursuant to which Seller will be
responsible for filing and furnishing IRS Forms W-2 and 941 for the wages and
other compensation Seller or its Affiliates pay to the Business
Employees, and Buyer will be responsible for filing and furnishing IRS Forms
W-2 and 941 for the wages and other compensation Buyer or its Affiliates pay
to the Hired Employees.   

10.4 _Cooperation_. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate reasonably in (a)
preparing and filing all Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets,
the Assumed Liabilities or the Business, including the furnishing or making
available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably
required), books of account, powers of attorney and other
materials reasonably necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax
Returns and providing Buyer the necessary information to allow Buyer to
adjust its base period for purposes of computing the research and development
credit in accordance with Section 41(f)(3) of the Code, (b) giving the other
party timely written notice of and responding to any inquiries, audits or
similar proceedings by any Tax authority relating to Taxes with respect to
the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business and (c)
resolving all disputes and audits with any Tax Authority relating to Taxes
with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the
Business.   

10.5 _Property Tax Proration_. All real and personal property Taxes with
respect to the Purchased Assets assessed during the calendar year of the
Closing will be prorated as of the Closing with Seller being liable for such
Taxes attributable to the days in the calendar year through and including the
Closing Date and Buyer being liable for such Taxes attributable to days in
the calendar year after the Closing Date. Proration of property Taxes shall be
made on the basis of the most recent officially certified Tax valuation and
assessment for the Acquired Assets. If such valuation pertains to a Tax
period other than that in which the Closing occurs, such proration shall be
recalculated at such time as actual Tax bills for such period are available
and the parties shall cooperate with each other in all respects in connection
with such recalculation and pay any sums due in consequence thereof to the
party entitled to recover the same within sixty days after the issuance of
such actual Tax bills.   

ARTICLE XI

Any notice of change of address will be effective only upon receipt.   

11.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.   

11.3 _Assignability_. Subject to Section 5.13(b), neither this Agreement, nor
any of the rights or obligations hereunder, may be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
provided that Buyer may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyer
without the consent of Seller, provided that no such assignment by Buyer to an
Affiliate shall release Buyer from any liability or obligation under this
Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11.3 shall
be void. This Agreement and its rights and obligations will be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.   

11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which when executed will be deemed an original, but all
of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange
by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission of executed
counterparts of this Agreement will be deemed execution and delivery
thereof.   

11.5 _Public Announcement_. Neither Buyer nor Seller will issue or permit any
of its respective Affiliates, agents, stockholders, directors, officers or
employees to issue, any press release or public filing or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby (other than any
mutual press release announcing this Agreement) without the prior
written consent of the other, provided that nothing contained herein will
prevent Buyer or its Affiliates from furnishing, after the Closing, any
required information to, or filing any required information with, any
Governmental Entity or national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer
quotation system in which the securities of Buyer or its Affiliates are
listed or admitted for trading or in order to comply with any legal
obligations.   

11.6 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the fees
and disbursements of the counsel, accountants or auditors retained by each
party in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
performance of this Agreement, or any other document, agreement or
requirement contemplated by or resulting from the transactions described in
this Agreement) will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein.   

11.7 _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Subject to Section 5.13(b), this
Agreement is not intended to and will not be construed to give any Person
other than the parties signatory hereto any interest or rights (including any
third party beneficiary rights) with respect to or in connection with this
Agreement or provision contained herein or contemplated hereby.   

11.8 _Dispute Resolution_.   

(a) _Covered Disputes_. Prior to the parties exercising any rights pursuant
to Section 11.9, any dispute, controversy or claim (whether sounding in
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
including the meaning of its provisions, or the proper performance of any of
its terms by any party hereto, or its breach, termination or
invalidity (each, a " _Dispute_ ") will be resolved in accordance with the
procedures specified in this Section 11.8, except as described in Sections
2.5 through 2.9 or the Ancillary Agreements.   

(b) _Initiation of Procedures_. Either party hereto wishing to initiate the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 11.8 shall give
written notice of the Dispute to the other party hereto (" _Dispute Notice_
").   

(c) _Negotiation Between Executives_. If a party hereto has given a Dispute
Notice under the preceding subsection, the President and CEO of Seller and
Buyer Parent (or a designee satisfactory to the other party) will attempt in
good faith to resolve the Dispute within forty-five (45) days of the issuance
of the Dispute Notice. The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that such
individuals shall be executives who have authority to settle the Dispute
on behalf of their respective organizations. Within fifteen (15) days after
delivery of the Dispute Notice, the receiving party will submit to the other
a written response. The response will include (i) a statement of that partys
position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (ii) the
name and title of the senior executives described above and of any other
person who will accompany them. Within forty-five (45) days after delivery of
the Dispute Notice, the executives of Buyer and Seller and any individual(s)
accompanying them will meet at a mutually acceptable time and place, and
thereafter, as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve
the Dispute.   

(d) _Mediation_. If the Dispute has not been resolved by negotiation under
Section 11.8(c) within sixty (60) days of the Dispute Notice, and only in
such event, Seller or Buyer shall initiate the mediation procedure of this
Section 11.8(d) by giving written notice to the other party (" _Mediation
Notice_ "). The parties hereto will endeavor to settle the Dispute by non-
binding mediation within ninety (90) days of the Mediation Notice under the
then current CPR International Institute for Conflict Prevention and
Resolution (" _CPR_ ") Mediation Procedure. The mediation shall be conducted
in Chicago, IL. If the parties have not agreed upon a mediator within five
(5) business days after the Mediation Notice, Buyer or Seller may request
CPRs assistance in the selection of a mediator under its guidelines. The
mediator will establish rules for an expedited discovery procedure and will
resolve all disputes with regard to discovery between the parties. Each party
to the mediation shall bear its own expenses in connection with such
mediation, and the fees and expenses of the mediator shall be shared equally
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand.   

(e) _Tolling and Performance_. If a party hereto gives another party hereto a
Dispute Notice within the applicable statute of limitation or the applicable
survival period, the statute of limitation or the survival period relating to
that particular Dispute shall be tolled,  _provided_ that the party pursues
dispute resolution in accordance with the time frame specified in this
Section 11.8. The parties hereto will take any further action required
to effectuate that tolling. Each party hereto is required to continue to
perform its obligations under this Agreement pending final resolution of any
Dispute, unless to do so would be impossible or impracticable under the
circumstances.   

(f) _Confidentiality_. Except as required by Law, none of Seller, Buyer nor
any of their respective representatives may disclose the existence, content,
or results of any dispute resolution procedure hereunder without the prior
written consent of each of Seller and Buyer.   

11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.   

(a) Subject to prior compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.8,
with respect to any Action resulting from, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
this Agreement, and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by
the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the " _Designated Courts_ ").
In any such action, suit or proceeding, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise (i) any claim that it is not subject to
the jurisdiction of the Designated Courts, (ii) that its property is exempt
or immune from attachment or execution, (iii) that such action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, (iv) that the venue of such
action, suit or proceeding is improper, (v) that such action, suit
or proceeding should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of
the Designated Courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some
other proceeding in any other court other than one of the Designated Courts,
or (vi) that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced
in or by the Designated Courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees not
to commence any such action, suit or proceeding other than before one of the
Designated Courts. Each of the parties hereto also hereby agrees that any
final and unappealable judgment against a party in connection with any such
action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such party and
that such judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction,
either within or outside of the U.S. A certified or exemplified copy of such
award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such
award or judgment. With respect to any action, suit or proceeding for which
it has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this Section 11.9, each party
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for the
giving of notices pursuant to Section 11.1 of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 11.9 shall affect the right of any party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall
not (a) constitute submission to jurisdiction or general consent to service
of process in the State of Delaware for any purpose except with respect to
any action, suit or proceeding resulting from, relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or (b) be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the
respective parties to this Agreement.   

(b) TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE
PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS
PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING,
AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.   

11.10 _Governing Law_. Except as provided in Section 11.16, this Agreement and
its validity, construction and performance will be governed in all respects
by the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and wholly
performed in such state.   

11.11 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have an adequate remedy at law if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Therefore, the obligations of
Seller under this Agreement, including Sellers obligation to sell the
Purchased Assets to Buyer, and the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement,
including Buyers obligation to purchase and acquire the Purchased Assets and
assume the Assumed Liabilities from Seller, shall be enforceable by an order
of specific performance issued in connection with any decision made in
accordance with this Section 11.11, and appropriate injunctive relief may
be applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall,
however, be cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any
other remedies which any party may have under this Agreement or
otherwise.   

11.12 _Seller Disclosure Schedule_. No reference to or disclosure of any item
or other matter in any Section of this Agreement, including any section or
subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, will be construed as an admission or indication that such item or
other matter is material or that such item or other matter is required to be
referred to or disclosed in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing, no such
reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any contract,
Law or order of a Governmental Entity will be construed as an admission or
indication that any breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.
Matters reflected in any Section of this Agreement, including any Section of
the Disclosure Schedule, are not necessarily limited to matters required by
this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature.   

11.13 _Amendment; Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or modified except by a written instrument signed by all of the
parties hereto. Either Buyer or Seller may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition
will not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent
waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or
condition, of this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of
its rights hereunder will not constitute a waiver of any of such
rights.   

11.14 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Annexes, Schedules and
Exhibits hereto, and the Ancillary Agreements set forth the entire agreement
and understanding among the parties as to the subject matter hereof and merge
and supersede all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every
kind and nature among them with respect to the subject matter hereof, and no
party hereto will be bound by any representation, warranty, covenant, term or
condition, whether written or oral, other than as expressly provided for in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement as to the subject matter hereof or
thereof.   

11.15 _Sealed Instrument_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that it is
their intent that this Agreement be, and that it will be treated and
construed as, a sealed instrument for all purposes of the laws of the State
of Delaware including the statute of limitations applicable to sealed
instruments.   

11.16 _Guarantees_.   

(a) From and after the date hereof, Buyer Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment and performance by
Buyer (which term shall include any assignees of any of its obligations under
this Agreement) of all of its obligations under Sections 2.5 thru 2.11,
Article IX and Section 11.11 of this Agreement (" _Buyer Guaranteed
Obligations_ ") when the same shall become due, in each case after any
applicable grace periods or notice requirements, according to the terms of
this Agreement (the " _Buyer Parent Guaranty_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that Buyer Parent shall not be liable to make any payment until two Business
Days following receipt by Buyer Parent of written notice from Seller that a
payment or other amount is due thereunder. Buyer Parent hereby agrees that
its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the
validity or enforceability of this Agreement against Buyer, any change
therein or amendment thereto, the absence of any action to enforce or any
waiver of any default in respect of the same, the recovery of any judgment
against Buyer or any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstances
which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of
a guarantor; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer Parents obligations
under the Buyer Parent Guaranty shall be subject to defenses available to
Buyer, other than the bankruptcy or insolvency of any of Buyer or the
validity or enforceability of the obligations of Seller, and (ii) nothing
contained herein shall be construed to be a waiver by Buyer Parent of notice
to Buyer Parent required pursuant to this _Section 11.16(a)_ or _Section
11.1_ hereof with respect to this Agreement and the obligations evidenced
hereby. Buyer Parent covenants that the Buyer Parent Guaranty will not be
discharged except by complete performance of the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations
and Buyer Parents obligations under this Section 11.16(a).   

(i) Buyer Parent shall be subrogated to all rights of Seller in respect of any
amounts paid by Seller pursuant to the provisions of the Buyer Parent
Guaranty.   

(ii) The Buyer Parent Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any amount owed
to Seller under the Buyer Parent Guaranty or the Buyer Guaranteed Obligations
is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Seller upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of Buyer Parent, Buyer or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.   

(iii) The Buyer Parent Guaranty shall be construed and enforced in accordance
with, and governed by, the Laws of the State of New York.   

(b) Effective only from and after the occurrence of a Seller Insolvency Event,
GE hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual
payment and performance by Seller (which term shall include any assignees of
any of its obligations under this Agreement) of all of its obligations under
Article IX of this Agreement (" _Seller Guaranteed Obligations_ ") when the
same shall become due, in each case after any applicable grace periods or
notice requirements, according to the terms of this Agreement (the " _GE
Guaranty_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that GE shall not be liable to make
any payment until two Business Days following receipt by GE of written notice
from Buyer that a payment or other amount is due thereunder. Except as
otherwise provided in the immediately preceding sentence, GE hereby agrees
that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the
validity or enforceability of this Agreement against Seller, any change
therein or amendment thereto, the absence of any action to enforce or any
waiver of any default in respect of the same, the recovery of any judgment
against Seller or any action to enforce the same, or any other circumstances
which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
guarantor; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) GEs obligations under the GE
Guaranty shall be subject to defenses available to Seller, other than the
bankruptcy or insolvency of any of Seller or the validity or enforceability
of the obligations of Buyer, and (ii) nothing contained herein shall be
construed to be a waiver by GE of notice to GE required pursuant to this
_Section 11.16(b)_ or _Section 11.1_ hereof with respect to this Agreement
and the obligations evidenced hereby. GE covenants that the GE Guaranty will
not be discharged except by complete performance of Seller Guaranteed
Obligations and GEs obligations under this Section 11.16(b).   

(i) GE shall be subrogated to all rights of Buyer in respect of any amounts
paid by GE pursuant to the provisions of the GE Guaranty.   

(ii) The GE Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment of any amount owed to Buyer under the
GE Guaranty or the Seller Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by Buyer upon the insolvency, bankruptcy
or reorganization of GE, Seller or otherwise, all as though such payment had
not been made.   

(iii) The GE Guaranty shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and
governed by, the Laws of the State of New York.
