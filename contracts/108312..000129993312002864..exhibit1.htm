Unresolved Items. In resolving any Unresolved Item, the Neutral Auditors may not assign a value to
such item greater than the greatest value for such item asserted by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item asserted by either party. The parties will use reasonable efforts to
cause the Neutral Auditors to issue their resolution within 30&nbsp;days after the submission of the
Unresolved Items to the Neutral Auditors. The Neutral Auditors&#146; resolution of the Unresolved Items
will be set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and Buyer. Such resolution will be
deemed to be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller for all purposes of this Agreement and will
be final and binding on, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto. Either party will be entitled
to have judgment entered upon such resolution, in a manner consistent with such resolution, in any
court having jurisdiction. If the Unresolved Items are resolved by the Neutral Auditors, the Final
Closing Working Capital Statement will consist of the applicable amounts from the Preliminary
Statement (or amounts otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer) as to items that have not
been submitted for resolution to the Neutral Auditors, and the amounts determined by the Neutral
Auditors as to the Unresolved Items that were submitted for resolution by the Neutral Auditors.
Any changes to the Preliminary Statement resulting from such resolution of the Unresolved Items

Adjustment is a negative amount, then Seller will pay to Buyer the absolute value of the
Post-Closing Adjustment.

hereunder, together with the other rights and assets being licensed or acquired by Buyer hereunder
and under the Ancillary Agreements and the services to be provided by Seller or its Affiliates
pursuant to the terms of the Ancillary Agreements, will constitute all of the tangible and
intangible assets of any nature whatsoever, necessary to operate the Business immediately after the
Closing in substantially the same manner conducted by Seller in the 12&nbsp;months prior to the date
hereof (it being understood that after the Closing the Business will not have the benefit of any
goodwill associated with the Seller name or any other intangible benefit associated with being
affiliated with Seller, or subject to Section&nbsp;5.2, any right to use any Seller Marks);
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U> that this Section&nbsp;3.7 will not be deemed to be breached as a
result of any action of Seller or its Affiliates expressly required by or performed in accordance
with Section&nbsp;5.1 or for which Buyer has provided its consent executed by the General Counsel of
Buyer (including pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.1).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;All material tangible assets (whether owned or leased) included in the Purchased Assets
are, in the aggregate, in reasonable condition and repair (except for ordinary wear and tear and
ordinary course maintenance and repair that would not materially interfere in the conduct of the
Business as currently conducted) for comparable assets in the industry.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">3.8 <U>Real Property</U>. Section&nbsp;3.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all the Real
Property owned by Seller or its Affiliates Related to the Business (the &#147;<B><I>Owned Real Property</I></B>&#148;) and
the location and record owner thereof. Seller has good and valid fee simple title to the Owned

subleases, licenses, concessions or other agreements granting to any party or parties the right of
use or occupancy of any portion of the Owned Real Property; (ii)&nbsp;no outstanding options or rights
of first refusal to purchase the Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein;

right to sell, convey or otherwise transfer its interest in the Owned Real Property. Seller has

necessary to allow interconnection, vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress to and from the
Owned Real Property. The Owned Real Property is in material compliance with all applicable laws,
easements, covenants and similar restrictions, building restrictions and other zoning, building,
fire and safety codes or regulations for its intended use. All components of all buildings,
structures and other improvements included in or located on the Owned Real Property are in good
operating condition and repair, except for normal wear and tear, sufficient in all material
respects for Seller to operate the Business as presently conducted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">3.9 <U>Transactions with Affiliates</U>. Section&nbsp;3.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
contains a list of all Contracts between Seller with respect to the Business, on the one hand, and
any Affiliate of Seller, on the other, including any intercompany services, loan, guarantee or
purchase or sales agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">3.10 <U>Intellectual Property</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.10(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
of all Intellectual Property included in the Purchased Assets that is Registered and indicates, for
each listed item, the owner of such Intellectual Property, the jurisdiction in which such
Intellectual Property is Registered, the registration or application number, and the filing dates
thereof. Section&nbsp;3.10(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list
(by name and version number) of all Business Products.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;To the Knowledge of Seller, all of the Transferred IP is valid, subsisting and
enforceable. All the Transferred IP that is Registered is in good standing, with all fees paid in
full and filings made to date, and Seller has taken all necessary action and made all necessary
filings to ensure that no such registration or application will be abandoned. Set forth in Section
3.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a list of any renewals, fee payments, filings of an
affidavit or Patent application or any other action that is or will be required to be taken with
respect to any of the Transferred IP that is Registered within 12&nbsp;months from the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Seller and its Affiliates have good and valid title to the Transferred IP and all of the
Transferred IP is wholly and exclusively owned by Seller or its Affiliates free and clear of Liens
other than Permitted Liens and neither Seller nor its Affiliates has sold, transferred, assigned or
otherwise disposed of any rights or interests therein or thereto. With respect to any Transferred
IP of which Seller or its Affiliates is a joint owner or co-owner, there are no restrictions (by
agreement with any third party joint owner or co-owner of such Transferred IP or otherwise) on
Seller&#146;s or its Affiliates&#146; exercise of the full scope of rights afforded a joint owner or co-owner
of that type of Intellectual Property right under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which the
Intellectual Property right exists.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;On the Closing Date, the rights in the Transferred IP conveyed to Buyer hereunder,
together with the Intellectual Property rights being licensed to Buyer or that Buyer otherwise has
the right to use under an Ancillary Agreement, will constitute all of the Intellectual Property
rights necessary to operate the Business immediately after the Closing in substantially the same
manner conducted by Seller in the 12&nbsp;months prior to the date hereof; provided, however, that the
foregoing representation and warranty is not intended to be a representation regarding the absence
of infringement or misappropriation, which is addressed in Section&nbsp;3.10(e). Seller and each Seller
Affiliate has a valid license to use the Licensed Business IP, subject only to the terms of the
Business IP Agreements. Seller and its Affiliates have sufficient rights to use the Business IP in
connection with the operation of the Business, all of which rights will survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unchanged. Seller has the authority to grant to
Buyer the licenses in the Retained Business IP granted hereunder and under the Intellectual
Property Cross-License Agreement and Seller has not granted any licenses to any third party
inconsistent with the rights granted hereunder or under the Intellectual Property Cross-License
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;The operation of the Business, including the design, development, use, import, export,
manufacture, licensing, sale or other disposition of Business Products and the provision of service
offerings, does not infringe, misappropriate or violate the Intellectual Property (other than
Patents) of any Person or, to the Knowledge of Seller, the Patents of any Person and has not done
so in the last two years. No claims have been asserted in writing against Seller or any of its
Affiliates alleging that such operation or any Business Product or the provision of any service
offerings infringes, misappropriates or violates the Intellectual Property rights of any Person.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;To the Knowledge of Seller, no Person is engaging, or has engaged in the last two years,
in any activity that infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates or conflicts with any
Intellectual Property included in the Purchased Assets, and neither Seller nor any of its

combination with any other mark (collectively, the &#147;<B><I>Seller Marks</I></B>&#148;), and that none of the rights

a result of the use of a mold or die used by the Business in which Seller Marks are embedded) and
use and reproduce advertising materials, packaging, documentation, Software, stationery, forms,

change to, or discontinuance of, the use of any Seller Marks in connection with any particular
Business Products or other materials, the approval of a Governmental Entity is required or any

such Seller Marks in connection with such Business Products or other materials until such approval
is obtained. Buyer will diligently pursue such approvals. In addition, Buyer will have no
obligation to modify or update any Business Products distributed prior to the Closing Date to
remove or prevent the continued inclusion or display of the Seller Marks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates shall

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will make (i)&nbsp;any offer of employment to any
individual to become a Business Employee or (ii)&nbsp;any change in status concerning promotion,

exclusively engaged in the Business (each, a &#147;<B><I>Business Employee</I></B>&#148;) outside the ordinary course of
business, without the consent of Buyer. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the Business
Employees shall continue to be employed by Seller until the day before the Transfer Date pursuant
to the Employee Services Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Effective as of the Transfer Date, Buyer will offer comparable employment as a successor
employer to all unrepresented Business Employees (except for the Retained Employee) who are
actively employed (including employees on vacation, holiday, jury duty, or other similar absence)
by Seller or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Transfer Date. Buyer also shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, offer re-instatement or employment as a successor employer, as the
case may be, to each unrepresented Business Employee who is not actively employed immediately prior
to the Transfer Date and who has a right of reinstatement pursuant to Seller policy or applicable
Law (collectively, &#147;<B><I>Inactive Contract Employees</I></B>&#148;), in each case promptly upon his or her return
from any leave or other absence. All Business Employees to whom Buyer offers employment and who
accept such employment are herein referred to as the &#147;<B><I>Hired Employees</I></B>,&#148; and any Inactive Contract
Employee shall be treated as a Hired Employee upon his or her return to, or commencement of active
employment with, Buyer or its Affiliates. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;5.5(b), &#147;comparable
employment as a successor employer&#148; means such material terms and conditions as are necessary to
avoid a claim for severance benefits. Seller hereby acknowledges that Buyer providing the terms and
conditions described in clauses (i), (v)&nbsp;and (vi)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;5.5(b) and Section&nbsp;5.5(c), as
well as the same principal work location and with substantially equivalent duties as in effect
immediately prior to the Transfer Date, will constitute &#147;comparable employment as a successor
employer&#148; as described herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;For the period starting on the Transfer Date and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, each unrepresented Hired Employee shall be entitled to receive while in the employ of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates the same or similar base salary or wage rate, and (to the extent
any such Hired Employee was provided incentive compensation and bonus opportunities by Seller prior
to the Transfer Date) amount of incentive compensation and bonus opportunities as provided by
Seller immediately prior to the Transfer Date. In addition, Buyer shall provide each unrepresented
Hired Employee, for the period starting on the Transfer Date and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date while in the employ of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, with substantially
equivalent employee benefits having a comparable aggregate employer-provided value to all benefits
provided to such individual under the applicable Seller Benefit Plans in effect immediately prior
to the Transfer Date; provided that (A)&nbsp;for purposes of this covenant, stock options and other
equity awards shall be disregarded and (B)&nbsp;this provision does not oblige Buyer to provide defined
benefit pension benefits for such unrepresented Hired Employees. Seller acknowledges and agrees
that Buyer&#146;s benefits program in the aggregate as disclosed to Seller and described in Schedule
5.5(b)(i) satisfies the standard set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

Business Employees under the terms and conditions outlined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement
identified on Section&nbsp;3.15(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with any labor organization
representing Business Employees. Effective on the Transfer Date, Buyer will assume the Collective
Bargaining Agreement set forth in Section&nbsp;3.15(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and all
represented Business Employees shall be treated as Hired Employees. Buyer shall establish a new
defined benefit pension plan (the &#147;Buyer&#146;s Pension Plan&#148;) that would have the same benefit
multiplier and other terms and conditions regarding vesting and eligibility to participate and
receive benefits that are the same as those contained in the GE Mechanical Systems-Los Angeles
Pension Plan for UAW Local 509 Hourly Employees (&#147;GE Local 509 Plan&#148;) in such manner as to comply
with the Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to employment on and after the Transfer Date;
provided, however, that Seller agrees to amend the GE Local 509 Plan effective on and after the
Transfer Date to treat Buyer and any member of a group under common control with Buyer for purposes
of Section 414(b) or (c)&nbsp;of the Code as an &#147;Employer&#148; solely with respect to determining the
eligibility of any represented Hired Employees on or after the Transfer Date for a disability
retirement pension under the GE Local 509 Plan. Buyer shall also, for the duration of the current
Collective Bargaining Agreement on and after the Transfer Date, make employer matching
contributions under a plan qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code with respect to
represented Hired Employees at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of compensation contributed to such
plan by any such employee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(iv)&nbsp;Effective as of the Transfer Date, Seller shall pay any Hired Employee the appropriate
accrued amounts of sick leave pay, vacation pay or other paid time off of such Hired Employees, as
required by applicable Law.

Affiliates to, provide severance benefits to any unrepresented Hired Employee who is laid off or
made redundant or during the period starting on the Transfer Date and ending on the first

severance payments, transition payments and continued health coverage) that the employee would have
been entitled to pursuant to and under circumstances consistent with the terms of the applicable
Seller Benefit Plans as in effect on the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(vi)&nbsp;Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, waive limitations on benefits relating to
any pre-existing conditions of the Hired Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents (but
only to the extent such pre-existing condition limitations were waived under the Seller Benefit
Plans as of the Transfer Date). Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under their health plans applicable to Hired
Employees, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Hired Employees and their respective
spouses and dependents under Seller&#146;s or any of its Affiliates&#146; health plans in 2013.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided in the Employee Services Agreement, Hired Employees will
cease active participation in any Seller Benefit Plan (other than the Assumed Plans) and will
commence participation in employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements offered by Buyer
(&#147;<B><I>Buyer Benefit Plans</I></B>&#148;) effective as of 11:59&nbsp;p.m. local time on the day immediately before the
Transfer Date. Such Hired Employees will be given credit under Buyer Benefit Plans for all service
prior to the Transfer Date with Seller (to the extent credit was given by Seller) for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and, to the extent applicable, calculation of vacation or other paid time off,
or severance benefits; provided, however, that such service will not be credited for purposes of
benefit accruals under any such Buyer Benefit Plans (other than for vacation, other paid time off
or severance benefits).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Seller has satisfied its obligation under applicable labor law with respect to represented
Business Employees regarding the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and has not received any request on behalf of such represented Business Employees to engage in any
bargaining relating to such contemplated transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Effective as of the Transfer Date, Buyer shall assume sponsorship of and all obligations
under, liabilities with respect to, and assets (if any) with respect to, the Seller Benefit Plans
set forth on Section&nbsp;5.5(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the &#147;<B><I>Assumed Plans</I></B>&#148;) provided,
however, that Seller will remain responsible for (i)&nbsp;any uninsured liabilities under the Assumed
Plans applicable to individuals who as of the Closing Date are former employees of Seller and (ii)
any claims incurred and unpaid under the Assumed Plans prior to the Closing with respect to any
self-insured Assumed Plan. Seller shall take all actions necessary to transfer such sponsorship and

in connection therewith. Prior to the Transfer Date, Seller shall cause the members of any
committee charged with administrative and/or fiduciary responsibility with respect to any of the
Assumed Plans to relinquish their membership in such committee effective as of the Transfer Date.
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, appoint all administrators, fiduciaries and others
responsible for the Assumed Plans on and after the Transfer Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;Nothing in this Section&nbsp;5.5 shall (i)&nbsp;confer any rights upon any person, including any

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to convey, assign, transfer or deliver to Buyer any Contract or
Permit or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an
attempted conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof, or an agreement to do any of the
foregoing, without the Consent of a third party (including any Governmental Entity), would
constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or a violation of Law or would in any way
adversely affect the rights of Buyer (as assignee or transferee of Seller, or otherwise) thereto or
thereunder. Subject to the last sentence of Section&nbsp;5.3(a)(iv) and except as set forth on Section
5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any Consent necessary for the conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery of any such

not obtained, or if an attempted conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof or
performance thereof by Buyer would be ineffective or a violation of Law or would adversely affect
the rights of Buyer thereto or thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights,
Seller and Buyer will cooperate in a mutually acceptable arrangement under which Buyer would, in
compliance with Law, obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens
associated with such Contract or Permit, claim, right or benefit in accordance with this Agreement,

monies received by them under any such Contract or Permit, claim, right or benefit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Contract or Permit shall be conveyed, assigned, transferred
and delivered to Buyer upon receipt of the requisite consent unless such attempted contribution,
conveyance, assignment, transfer or delivery thereof would be ineffective or a violation of Law or
would adversely affect the rights of Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Where the Consent of a third party (including any Governmental Entity) is required to

necessary Consent for such assignment or novation, Buyer shall perform as a subcontractor to Seller

including requirements to comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, under such
Government Contract. Buyer agrees to pay, perform and discharge and indemnify and hold Seller
harmless from any obligation and liability of Seller arising after the Closing Date and relating to
such performance or failure to perform under such Government Contracts after the Closing Date,

shall pay Buyer such amounts no later than thirty (30)&nbsp;days after Buyer&#146;s demand therefor, which

IP</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;If, in any action to enforce the Transferred IP, Buyer receives any damages or other
compensation relating to infringement, violation, misappropriation or other unauthorized use of the
Transferred IP that occurred prior to Closing (&#147;<B><I>Pre-Closing Damages</I></B>&#148;), Buyer shall promptly pay
Seller such Pre-Closing Damages to Seller, minus an amount equal to the percentage of the total
costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in such action (including attorney fees) corresponding to the
percentage of the total damages and other compensation relating to infringement, violation,
misappropriation or other unauthorized use of the Transferred IP received by Buyer in such action
that is represented by the Pre-Closing Damages. For example, if in such an action Buyer were to
receive $1,000 in total damages and other compensation of which $500 are Pre-Closing Damages and
Buyer were to have incurred $750 in total costs and expenses, then the amount to be paid by Buyer
to Seller would be $500 &#151; ((500/1000) x $750) or $125.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Following the Closing, Seller shall be entitled to assert claims of infringement,
violation, misappropriation or other unauthorized use of the Transferred IP based on actions that

of Intellectual Property, provided, however, that Seller (i)&nbsp;shall promptly notify Buyer in
writing, prior to responding to such claim or suit and (ii)&nbsp;shall not enter into any settlement or
compromise of any such claim or suit that affects or concerns the validity, enforceability or
ownership of any Transferred IP without the prior written consent of Buyer, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

promptly notify the party or parties liable for such indemnification (the &#147;<B><I>Indemnifying Party</I></B>&#148;) in

describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of

pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.2(a), with respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may
assume the defense of such claim and shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to assume the defense of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver written
notice of such election to the Indemnified Party (an &#147;<B><I>Assumption Notice</I></B>&#148;), which notice may contain
an acknowledgement of liability (an &#147;<B><I>Acknowledgement</I></B>&#148;) to indemnify the Indemnified Party with

set forth in this Article&nbsp;IX. The Party that shall control the defense of any such Third Party
Claim (the &#147;<B><I>Controlling Party</I></B>&#148;) shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized
standing and competence after consultation with the other party and shall take all steps reasonably
necessary in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim. Each of Seller or Buyer, as the

with the Controlling Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
be authorized to consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising

Party, <U>provided</U> that the Indemnifying Party shall (i)&nbsp;pay or cause to be paid all amounts
arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement
(subject to Sections&nbsp;9.3 and 9.5, if applicable), (ii)&nbsp;not encumber any of the assets of any
Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to, bind or materially
adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Party&#146;s business and (iii)
obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete release of any Indemnified
Party potentially affected by such Third Party Claim. In no event shall an Indemnified Party
consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the Indemnifying Party is the Controlling Party
and has complied with its obligations pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9.2(b).

Party Claim is to obtain an injunction, restraining order, declaratory relief or other non-monetary
relief (including criminal penalties) against the Indemnified Party, (ii)&nbsp;if the named parties to
any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party and the former shall have been advised in writing by counsel (with a
copy to the Indemnifying Party) that there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available to
them that are different from or additional to those available to Indemnifying Party, or any other
conflict, or (iii)&nbsp;if such action or proceeding involves, or could reasonably be expected to
involve, Liability that would constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the business of
the Indemnified Party; provided, further, that to exercise such rights the Indemnifying Party must
give notice to the Indemnified Person within 30&nbsp;days after receipt of any Indemnification
Certificate whether it is assuming control of and appointing lead counsel for such defense. If the
Indemnifying Party does not give such notice within such 30-day period, or does not diligently
defend the claim therefore, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume control of
the defense thereof at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with periodic reimbursement
of expenses, subject to the limitations of Liability and other limits set forth in this Article&nbsp;IX.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;&#147;<B><I>Defense Costs</I></B>&#148; means all costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, filing fees
and costs of investigation, incurred in connection with defense of the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party with respect to a Third Party Claim. This subsection (d)&nbsp;sets forth the default
allocation of Defense Costs solely to the extent Buyer and Seller cannot agree as to which party
shall bear responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim or ultimate liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim and, as a result, each of Buyer and Seller retains its own counsel in
respect of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will each pay
their respective Defense Costs in connection with any Third Party Claim, except, if the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim with respect to which it has
received an Indemnification Certificate or it does not include an Acknowledgement in its Assumption
Notice, then the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for (i)&nbsp;the amount of the
Indemnified Party&#146;s Defense Costs (and, in the event the Indemnifying Party delivers such
Acknowledgment, only such amount of Defense Costs up to the date on which an Acknowledgement is
delivered to the Indemnified Party) multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the quotient of (A)&nbsp;the amount payable or
paid by the Indemnifying Party in settlement or awarded in a final, non-appealable judgment
pursuant to any indemnity claim asserted by the Indemnified Party under this Article&nbsp;IX with
respect to such Third-Party Claim (excluding any Defense Costs), divided by (B)&nbsp;the aggregate
amount payable or paid in settlement or awarded in a final, non-appealable judgment by the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party to any third party with respect to such Third-Party
Claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if the quotient determined in accordance with clause
(ii)&nbsp;is less than 0.5, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for reimbursement of
any portion of the Indemnified Party&#146;s Defense Costs.

transfer of the Owned Real Property or any portion thereof, provided that Buyer used commercially
reasonable efforts to contractually obligate such prospective purchaser to agree to the same or
substantially similar restrictions on Environmental Activity as agreed to by Buyer in Section
9.3(b)(i) (A)-(G) hereof (but without regard to Buyer&#146;s ability to successfully obligate a
prospective purchaser to agree to such restrictions on Environmental Activity after using
commercially reasonable efforts); (ii)&nbsp;a material change in the use of the Owned Real Property on
or after the Closing Date to a non-industrial use except for any change in use that may occur in
connection with activities contemplated by the eminent domain proceeding disclosed on Section&nbsp;3.8
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; (iii)&nbsp;conducting any investigation or remediation of soil and/or
groundwater at the Real Property beyond the minimum applicable standards acceptable to the relevant
Governmental Entity or required under Environmental Law; or (iv)&nbsp;any negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of any Buyer Indemnified Party after the Closing Date that exacerbates any
environmental condition, including the presence of Hazardous Materials, at the Owned Real Property
existing prior to the Closing Date (including the Known Environmental Conditions), provided,
however, that in the case of 9.3(b)(ii), (iii)&nbsp;and (iv), Seller&#146;s indemnity obligations shall be
reduced and/or negated only to the extent that the Environmental Loss is attributable to such
change in use, amount such investigation or remediation is above minimum applicable standards, or
such exacerbation. Furthermore, Seller acknowledges that it may not assert that a Buyer
Indemnified Party is in breach of its duty to mitigate under Section&nbsp;9.6 by virtue of such Buyer
Indemnified Party failing to undertake any environmental sampling or testing of the Environment in
circumstances where 9.3(b)(i)(A)-(H) do not apply.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;9.2 with respect to third party claims, Seller shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to direct, manage and control any Environmental Activity at
the Owned Real Property that is necessary to address an Environmental Loss subject to
indemnification hereunder, provided, however, that Seller shall have first notified Buyer in
writing of Seller&#146;s acceptance of its responsibility to indemnify Buyer for such Environmental
Loss. Notwithstanding whether Seller elects to control the Environmental Activity as provided for
in this Section, the party conducting such activity shall provide the other party with reasonable
notice and opportunity to review, comment, and reasonably participate in and approve of any such
Environmental Activity or related communications with Governmental Entities. To the extent that
Seller elects to conduct any Environmental Activity as provided hereunder, Buyer shall provide
Seller with reasonable access to the Owned Real Property to conduct such Environmental Activity,
provided that Seller: (i)&nbsp;comply with applicable Laws (including Environmental Laws); (ii)&nbsp;carry
out such activities in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with the Business or the
Buyer&#146;s operations at the Owned Real Property; (iii)&nbsp;restore the Owned Real Property to a
substantially similar condition as existed immediately prior to Seller undertaking any such
Environmental Activity; and (iv)&nbsp;furnish or cause to be furnished to Buyer certificates of
insurance evidencing reasonable and customary coverage maintained by Seller&#146;s agents, employees,
independent contractors or consultants conducting any Environmental Activity at the Owned Real
Property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article&nbsp;IX, and except for
claims relating to breaches of Section&nbsp;3.5 or the Fundamental Representations, Seller will not be
obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of any claim of any Buyer Indemnified
Party for any breach of a representation or warranty under Section&nbsp;9.1(a)(i) unless the aggregate
dollar amount of all Losses in respect of such claim equals or exceeds the Basket Amount, in which
event Seller will be liable for all Losses resulting from such claim.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event will the
amount payable by Seller or its Affiliates for indemnification for any and all claims relating to
breaches of representations or warranties under Section&nbsp;9.1(a)(i) (except for claims relating to
breaches of Sections&nbsp;3.5, 3.7(a), the first sentence of Section&nbsp;3.10(d) or the Fundamental
Representations) in the aggregate exceed 20% of the Purchase Price (the &#147;<B><I>Cap Amount</I></B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;An Indemnified Party will not be entitled under this Agreement to multiple recoveries for
the same Losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;In connection with an alleged breach of Seller&#146;s representations and warranties under this
Agreement, Losses will be net of any specified reserves or Liabilities in respect of the subject
matter of such breach established on the Final Closing Working Capital Statement pursuant to
Sections&nbsp;2.5 through 2.9.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(h)&nbsp;With respect to indemnification contained in Section&nbsp;9.1(a)(i) of this Agreement (i)&nbsp;each
such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis, (ii)&nbsp;all Losses shall be net of any
third-party insurance proceeds that have been recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification; <U>provided</U> such netting does not
conflict with or violate any insurance policy, insurance Contract or insurance program, (iii)
Seller shall have no liability to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses
caused by or resulting from any action (A)&nbsp;expressly required by, and performed in accordance with,
Section&nbsp;5.1, or (B)&nbsp;for which Buyer has provided its prior written consent executed by the General
Counsel of Buyer (including pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.1) or (C)&nbsp;that Seller does not take as a result
of Buyer unreasonably withholding its consent pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.1.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;If an Indemnifying Party makes any payment for any Losses suffered or incurred by an
Indemnified Party pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;IX, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to
any insurance benefits of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses and with respect to the
claim giving rise to such Losses; <U>provided</U> such subrogation does not conflict with or
violate any insurance policy, insurance Contract or insurance program.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.4 <U>Adjustments to Purchase Price</U>. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, all
payments made with respect to the rights of indemnity under Article&nbsp;IX will be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.5 <U>Certain Damages; Sole Remedy</U>. Except with respect to claims of fraud or Third
Party Claims under Section&nbsp;9.2, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Seller nor Buyer will be liable to or otherwise responsible to any Indemnified
Party or any other Person for (a)&nbsp;any special, indirect or other damages, in each case that are
remote or speculative, not reasonably foreseeable or do not flow proximately from the underlying
breach or (b)&nbsp;punitive or exemplary damages, in each case in respect of a given breach of a
representation or covenant. Except with respect to the matters covered by Sections&nbsp;2.5 through 2.9
and other than with respect to any equitable remedies, or fraud, Seller and Buyer acknowledge and
agree that the indemnification provisions of Sections&nbsp;5.10(b), 5.14, 5.17(b) and 9.1 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies after the Closing of any Seller Indemnified Party and any Buyer
Indemnified Party, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of
contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on
common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that it may at any time suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with, any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement by Buyer or the Seller, respectively, or any failure by Buyer or Seller,
respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement set forth herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of
rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become entitled.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.6 <U>Mitigation</U>. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.7 <U>Third Party Remedies</U>. If any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is at any
time entitled (whether by reason of a contractual right, a right to take or bring a legal action,
availability of insurance, or a right to require a payment discount or otherwise, provided that no
such obligation exists to the extent that it would violate any subrogation or similar clause in any
insurance policies, insurance Contract or insurance programs) to recover from another Person any
amount in respect of any matter giving rise to a Loss (whether before or after a payment has been
made to an Indemnified Party hereunder and in respect thereof), the Indemnified Party shall (and
shall cause its applicable Affiliate to) (a)&nbsp;promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and provide
such information as the Indemnifying Party may require relating to such right of recovery and the
steps taken or to be taken by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith, including by assigning
any such rights to the Indemnifying Party if possible and to the extent necessary to enable the
Indemnifying Party to enforce such rights, (b)&nbsp;if so required by the Indemnifying Party (subject to
the Indemnified Party being indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Indemnifying Party
against all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
respect thereof), take commercially reasonable steps as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
require to pursue such recovery, and (c)&nbsp;keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the
progress of any action taken in respect thereof. If an Indemnified Party recovers any amounts in
respect of Losses from any third party at any time after the Indemnifying Party has paid all or a
portion of such Losses to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;IX,
the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so received (to
the extent of amounts previously paid by the Indemnifying Party).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">9.8 <U>Effect of Government and Third Party Consents</U>. Nothing set forth in any consent,
waiver, novation or similar instrument (a)&nbsp;executed and delivered by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to any Person, including a Governmental Entity, or (b)&nbsp;executed and delivered to or by any Person
(including a Governmental Entity, Aircelle, Boeing, or Seller), whether or not Buyer is an express
signatory, including the Aircelle Settlement or the Boeing Consent, shall affect, prejudice,
reduce, modify or foreclose Buyer&#146;s indemnification rights under this Article&nbsp;IX or the provisions
of Sections&nbsp;2.3 or 2.4 of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section&nbsp;9.8 shall not
affect information disclosed to Buyer in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or the effect of such
disclosure, in each case pursuant to, and for purposes of, Article&nbsp;III.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>TAX MATTERS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.1 <U>Transfer Taxes</U>. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller and
Buyer shall each be liable for one half of any transfer, gains, sales, use, stock transfer and
stamp taxes, recording, registration and other fees, and any other similar Taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or any Ancillary

filing of any Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including allowing each party to review and
approve the Tax Returns and related data prior to filing such Tax Returns and joining in the
execution of any such Tax Return or other documentation where necessary. Seller and Buyer will,
upon request of the other party, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Transfer Tax. The party required by Law to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer
Taxes shall timely prepare, with the other parties&#146; cooperation, and file such Tax Return. If
Seller files any such Tax Return, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for one half of any
Transfer Taxes paid by Seller in connection with the filing of such Tax Return. If Buyer files any
such Tax Return, Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for one half of any Transfer Taxes paid by
Buyer in connection with the filing of such Tax Return.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.2 <U>Bulk Sales Laws</U>. The parties hereby waive compliance with the provisions of any
tax clearance procedures, bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may
otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.3 <U>Predecessor-Successor Reporting for Federal Tax Purposes</U>. Seller and Buyer agree
to comply with the Standard Procedure described in Section&nbsp;4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2
C.B. 320, pursuant to which Seller will be responsible for filing and furnishing IRS Forms W-2 and
941 for the wages and other compensation Seller or its Affiliates pay to the Business Employees,
and Buyer will be responsible for filing and furnishing IRS Forms W-2 and 941 for the wages and
other compensation Buyer or its Affiliates pay to the Hired Employees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.4 <U>Cooperation</U>. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate reasonably in (a)&nbsp;preparing and
filing all Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the
Business, including the furnishing or making available during normal business hours of records,
personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney and other materials
reasonably necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns and providing Buyer the
necessary information to allow Buyer to adjust its base period for purposes of computing the
research and development credit in accordance with Section&nbsp;41(f)(3) of the Code, (b)&nbsp;giving the
other party timely written notice of and responding to any inquiries, audits or similar proceedings
by any Tax authority relating to Taxes with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Business and (c)&nbsp;resolving all disputes and audits with any Tax Authority
relating to Taxes with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">10.5 <U>Property Tax Proration</U>. All real and personal property Taxes with respect to the

If such valuation pertains to a Tax period other than that in which the Closing occurs, such
proration shall be recalculated at such time as actual Tax bills for such period are available and
the parties shall cooperate with each other in all respects in connection with such recalculation
and pay any sums due in consequence thereof to the party entitled to recover the same within sixty
days after the issuance of such actual Tax bills.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.2 <U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions
of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.3 <U>Assignability</U>. Subject to Section&nbsp;5.13(b), neither this Agreement, nor any of
the rights or obligations hereunder, may be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, provided that Buyer may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate
of Buyer without the consent of Seller, provided that no such assignment by Buyer to an Affiliate
shall release Buyer from any liability or obligation under this Agreement. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section&nbsp;11.3 shall be void. This Agreement and its rights and
obligations will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.4 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which when executed will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one
and the same instrument. The exchange by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission of
executed counterparts of this Agreement will be deemed execution and delivery thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.5 <U>Public Announcement</U>. Neither Buyer nor Seller will issue or permit any of its
respective Affiliates, agents, stockholders, directors, officers or employees to issue, any press
release or public filing or other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than any mutual press release announcing this Agreement) without the prior written
consent of the other, provided that nothing contained herein will prevent Buyer or its Affiliates
from furnishing, after the Closing, any required information to, or filing any required information
with, any Governmental Entity or national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation
system in which the securities of Buyer or its Affiliates are listed or admitted for trading or in
order to comply with any legal obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.6 <U>Expenses</U>. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the fees and disbursements of the counsel, accountants or auditors
retained by each party in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and performance
of this Agreement, or any other document, agreement or requirement contemplated by or resulting
from the transactions described in this Agreement) will be paid by the party incurring such costs
and expenses, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.7 <U>No Third Party Beneficiary Rights</U>. Subject to Section&nbsp;5.13(b), this Agreement is
not intended to and will not be construed to give any Person other than the parties signatory
hereto any interest or rights (including any third party beneficiary rights) with respect to or in
connection with this Agreement or provision contained herein or contemplated hereby.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Covered Disputes</U>. Prior to the parties exercising any rights pursuant to Section
11.9, any dispute, controversy or claim (whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise) arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, including the meaning of its provisions, or the proper
performance of any of its terms by any party hereto, or its breach, termination or invalidity
(each, a &#147;<B><I>Dispute</I></B>&#148;) will be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in this Section
11.8, except as described in Sections&nbsp;2.5 through 2.9 or the Ancillary Agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Initiation of Procedures</U>. Either party hereto wishing to initiate the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in this Section&nbsp;11.8 shall give written notice of the Dispute to
the other party hereto (&#147;<B><I>Dispute Notice</I></B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Negotiation Between Executives</U>. If a party hereto has given a Dispute Notice
under the preceding subsection, the President and CEO of Seller and Buyer Parent (or a designee
satisfactory to the other party) will attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute within
forty-five (45)&nbsp;days of the issuance of the Dispute Notice. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that such individuals shall be executives who have authority to settle the Dispute on
behalf of their respective organizations. Within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after delivery of the Dispute
Notice, the receiving party will submit to the other a written response. The response will include
(i)&nbsp;a statement of that party&#146;s position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and
(ii)&nbsp;the name and title of the senior executives described above and of any other person who will
accompany them. Within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the executives
of Buyer and Seller and any individual(s) accompanying them will meet at a mutually acceptable time
and place, and thereafter, as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to resolve the
Dispute.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Mediation</U>. If the Dispute has not been resolved by negotiation under Section
11.8(c) within sixty (60)&nbsp;days of the Dispute Notice, and only in such event, Seller or Buyer shall
initiate the mediation procedure of this Section&nbsp;11.8(d) by giving written notice to the other
party (&#147;<B><I>Mediation Notice</I></B>&#148;). The parties hereto will endeavor to settle the Dispute by non-binding
mediation within ninety (90)&nbsp;days of the Mediation Notice under the then current CPR International
Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (&#147;<B><I>CPR</I></B>&#148;) Mediation Procedure. The mediation shall
be conducted in Chicago, IL. If the parties have not agreed upon a mediator within five (5)
business days after the Mediation Notice, Buyer or Seller may request CPR&#146;s assistance in the
selection of a mediator under its guidelines. The mediator will establish rules for an expedited
discovery procedure and will resolve all disputes with regard to discovery between the parties.
Each party to the mediation shall bear its own expenses in connection with such mediation, and the
fees and expenses of the mediator shall be shared equally between Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Tolling and Performance</U>. If a party hereto gives another party hereto a Dispute
Notice within the applicable statute of limitation or the applicable survival period, the statute
of limitation or the survival period relating to that particular Dispute shall be tolled,
<U>provided</U> that the party pursues dispute resolution in accordance with the time frame
specified in this Section&nbsp;11.8. The parties hereto will take any further action required to
effectuate that tolling. Each party hereto is required to continue to perform its obligations
under this Agreement pending final resolution of any Dispute, unless to do so would be impossible
or impracticable under the circumstances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Confidentiality</U>. Except as required by Law, none of Seller, Buyer nor any of
their respective representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any dispute
resolution procedure hereunder without the prior written consent of each of Seller and Buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.9 <U>Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Subject to prior compliance with the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;11.8, with respect to
any Action resulting from, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement, and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware) (the &#147;<B><I>Designated Courts</I></B>&#148;). In any such action, suit or
proceeding, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise (i)&nbsp;any claim that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Designated Courts, (ii)&nbsp;that its property is exempt or immune from attachment
or execution, (iii)&nbsp;that such action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, (iv)
that the venue of such action, suit or proceeding is improper, (v)&nbsp;that such action, suit or
proceeding should be transferred or removed to any court other than one of the Designated Courts,
or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any other court other
than one of the Designated Courts, or (vi)&nbsp;that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not
be enforced in or by the Designated Courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees not to
commence any such action, suit or proceeding other than before one of the Designated Courts. Each
of the parties hereto also hereby agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party
in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such
party and that such judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within
or outside of the U.S. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. With respect to any action,
suit or proceeding for which it has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this Section&nbsp;11.9, each
party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for the giving of notices
pursuant to Section&nbsp;11.1 of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section&nbsp;11.9 shall affect the right of
any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. The foregoing consent to
jurisdiction shall not (a)&nbsp;constitute submission to jurisdiction or general consent to service of
process in the State of Delaware for any purpose except with respect to any action, suit or
proceeding resulting from, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or (b)&nbsp;be deemed to confer
rights on any Person other than the respective parties to this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY
WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A
COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND
BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS AND WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING
WITHOUT A JURY.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.10 <U>Governing Law</U>. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;11.16, this Agreement and its
validity, construction and performance will be governed in all respects by the Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts made and wholly performed in such state.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.11 <U>Specific Enforcement</U>. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and
that the parties would not have an adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Therefore, the obligations of Seller under this Agreement, including Seller&#146;s obligation to sell
the Purchased Assets to Buyer, and the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, including Buyer&#146;s
obligation to purchase and acquire the Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities from
Seller, shall be enforceable by an order of specific performance issued in connection with any
decision made in accordance with this Section&nbsp;11.11, and appropriate injunctive relief may be
applied for and granted in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and
not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party may have under this
Agreement or otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.12 <U>Seller Disclosure Schedule</U>. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other
matter in any Section of this Agreement, including any section or subsection of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, will be construed as an admission or
indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter is required
to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a
possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or order of a Governmental Entity will be
construed as an admission or indication that any breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. Matters reflected in any Section of this Agreement, including any Section of the
Disclosure Schedule, are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so
reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.13 <U>Amendment; Waiver</U>. No provision of this Agreement may be amended, supplemented
or modified except by a written instrument signed by all of the parties hereto. Either Buyer or
Seller may (a)&nbsp;extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party, (b)&nbsp;waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant hereto or (c)&nbsp;waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party
or parties to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition will not be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver
of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its
rights hereunder will not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.14 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement, including the Annexes, Schedules and Exhibits
hereto, and the Ancillary Agreements set forth the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties as to the subject matter hereof and merge and supersede all prior discussions, agreements
and understandings of every kind and nature among them with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and no party hereto will be bound by any representation, warranty, covenant, term or condition,
whether written or oral, other than as expressly provided for in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement as to the subject matter hereof or thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.15 <U>Sealed Instrument</U>. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that it is their
intent that this Agreement be, and that it will be treated and construed as, a sealed instrument
for all purposes of the laws of the State of Delaware including the statute of limitations
applicable to sealed instruments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">11.16 <U>Guarantees</U>.

insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Buyer Parent, Buyer or otherwise, all as though such
payment had not been made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(iii)&nbsp;The Buyer Parent Guaranty shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and
governed by, the Laws of the State of New York.
