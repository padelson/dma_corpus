Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) Subject in each case to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.1(f)_, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any
securities of Parent, the Company or Merger Sub, each share of Class A Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares, collectively,
" _Company Common Stock_ " and each, a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares,
Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of this Agreement
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the following
consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "): (i) $6.80 in
cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ "), and (ii) 0.7275 (the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ") common units representing limited partner interests in
Parent having the rights and obligations specified with respect to Common
Units in the Parent Partnership Agreement (the " _Common Units_ ").

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A
Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Company (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ ") outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, at the election of the holders of a
majority of such shares of Company Preferred Stock in accordance with that
certain Certificate of Designations of Series A Cumulative Perpetual
Convertible Preferred Stock of SemGroup Corporation, filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware on January 19, 2018 (the " _Certificate of
Designations_ "), either (i) convert into Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 8(c)(i) of the Certificate of Designations,
(ii) be exchanged for a "Substantially Equivalent Security" (as defined in
the

 



\- 3 -

    

 Certificate of Designations) pursuant to Section 8(c)(ii) of the Certificate
of Designations or (iii) be redeemed by the Company for cash at a price per
share equal to 101% of the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the
Certificate of Designations) pursuant to Section 8(c)(iv) of the Certificate
of Designations. Each holder of Shares issued upon conversion of shares of
Company Preferred Stock pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(i)_ shall receive
the Merger Consideration in exchange for such Shares. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, any election by the holders of shares of
Company Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ must be made
in accordance with the terms of Section 8(c) of the Certificate of
Designations.

 

(c) _Cancelled Shares_ _and_ _Subsidiary Shares_.

 

(i) Each Share that is held directly by the Company in treasury and each
Share that is held directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such Shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

 

(ii) Each Share that is held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (other than Merger Sub) or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (such Shares,
the " _Subsidiary Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into that certain
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that the
ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage
of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Conversion of_ _Merger Sub_ _Interests_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, the limited liability company interests of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and, together with the shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation issued in respect of the Subsidiary Shares as set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(ii)_, shall constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(e) _Fractional Units_. No fractional Common Units shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fractional Common Unit will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, a cash
payment (without interest and rounded to the nearest cent) in lieu of such
fractional Common Unit representing such holders proportionate interest, if
any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees
of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions
of Common Units equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of Common
Units to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.2(a)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of whole Common Units to be
issued to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_. No
certificates or scrip representing fractional Common Units shall be issued in
the Merger. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount

 



\- 4 -

    

 of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional
Common Units, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such
holders of Shares, without interest, subject to and in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

(f) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares or
outstanding Common Units shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
stock or unit split (including a reverse stock or unit split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares or units, or any stock or unit dividend or
stock or unit distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration, Per Share Cash Amount, the Exchange Ratio and any other
similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent,
Merger Sub and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and thereafter, all
references in this Agreement to the Merger Consideration, Per Share Cash
Amount, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items shall be
references to the Merger Consideration, Per Share Cash Amount, the Exchange
Ratio and any other similarly dependent items as so adjusted; _provided,
however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ shall be deemed to
permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not
otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares (other than Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares) that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights available under
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the consideration set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, as applicable, unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such holders rights to appraisal under the DGCL. Holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting
Shares held by them to the extent permitted by and in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such holders Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration or the consideration set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, as
applicable, without interest and less any required Tax withholding as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (i)
prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair
value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, voluntarily make or agree to make any material payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of_ _Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the

 



\- 5 -

    

 purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. Prior to the
Effective Time, (i) Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares (other
than the Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting Shares), Common
Units (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) issuable pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ and an amount of cash
sufficient to effect the delivery of the Merger Consideration to the holders
of the Shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting
Shares). Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, Common Units issuable and cash
sufficient to make any distributions pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_.
All Common Units and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent from time to time
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) business day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_,
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon surrender of the Certificates (including by delivery of the Shares,
book-entry notation, or affidavits of loss in lieu of delivery thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f))_, to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates or book-
entry notations representing Shares (in each case, " _Certificates_ ") in
exchange for, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional Common
Units pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ and any distributions payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, as applicable, that number of whole Common Units (after
taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and payment by cash or
check of that amount of cash Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, that amount of cash in lieu of
fractional Common Units which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ and any distributions payable pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.2(c)_ to which such holder is entitled, and the Shares represented by
the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any cash
payment is to be made to, or any Common Units constituting any part of the
Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of, a person other than
the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Share is registered, it
shall be a condition to the payment or registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment or delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in
the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_
__ _ 2.2(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(and any amounts to be paid pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ or _Section_
__ _ 2.2(c)_) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any amount payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ or  _Section_ __ _
2.2(c)_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged_ _Shares_. No
distributions with respect to Common Units with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates
with respect to the Common Units represented thereby, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional Common Units shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, until such Certificate has been surrendered in
accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder
thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, (A) the number
of whole Common Units (after taking into account all Shares surrendered by
such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1_, (B) payment by cash or check of that amount of cash Merger Consideration
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, (C) that
amount of cash in lieu of fractional Common Units to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_, and (D) the amount of
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole Common Units and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time

whole Common Units.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in_ _Company Common Stock_ _;_ _Closing_
_of Transfer Books_. All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ and any cash paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ shall be deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by
such Certificates. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of_ _Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_  shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional Common Units pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_
and any distributions pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed_ _Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Share represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.3 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger
Sub and the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any Tax Law,
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.
If withholding is taken in Common Units, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent (as applicable) shall be treated as having sold such Common Units for
an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such Common Units at the
time of such deemed sale.

_Governmental Entity_ ") is necessary, under applicable Law, for the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for such authorizations, consents, orders, licenses,
permits, approvals or filings that are not required to be obtained or made
prior to consummation of such transactions or that, if not obtained or made,
would not materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
(assuming the Company Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) result in any loss, or suspension, limitation or impairment of

Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or violate any applicable Laws, except in
the case of clauses (i) and (iii) for such losses, suspensions, limitations,
impairments, conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellation,
accelerations, or Liens as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

date hereof by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
since January 1, 2017 (all such documents and reports filed or furnished by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As
of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none
of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that information set forth in the
Company SEC Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the date thereof, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash
flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other
adjustments described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except,
in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

 

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has
established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e)
and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "). The Companys management has

 



\- 13 -

    

 completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2018,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its
most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to
the date hereof, management of the Company has disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting, and each such
deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been
disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or
reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,
2019 (the " _Balance Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in
the Company SEC Documents, (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred under
or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred
since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business and (d) for
liabilities and obligations that have been discharged or paid in full,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes
thereto), other than those which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.7 _Compliance with_ _Law_ _; Permits_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and are not in
default under or in violation of, any applicable federal, state, local or
foreign or multinational law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment,
order, injunction, decree or agency requirement of any Governmental Entity,
including common law (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except
where such non-compliance, default or violation would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1,
2017, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice or, to the Companys knowledge, other communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure
to comply with, any Law, except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions, qualifications and
registrations and orders of all applicable Governmental Entities, and all
rights under any Company Material Contract with all Governmental Entities, and
have filed all tariffs, reports, notices and other documents with all
Governmental Entities necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses
as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have any of the Company Permits or to have filed such tariffs,
reports, notices or other documents would not have, individually or in the

 



\- 14 -

    

 aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are valid
and in full force and effect and are not subject to any administrative or
judicial proceeding that could result in modification, termination or
revocation thereof, except where the failure to be in full force and effect or
any modification, termination or revocation thereof would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms and
requirements of all Company Permits, except where the failure to be in
compliance would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.8 _Environmental Laws_ _and Regulations_.

 

(a) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect: (i) there are no investigations, actions, suits or
proceedings (whether administrative or judicial) pending, or to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any person or entity whose liability the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other similarly situated
companies in the industries in which Parent and its Subsidiaries operate, or
(iii) resulting from or arising out of (A) any changes or developments in the
industries in which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries conducts its business,

underlying such failure has resulted in, or contributed to, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect so long as it is not otherwise excluded by this definition)
or 

 



\- 27 -

    

 (I) any changes in the share price or trading volume of the Common Units or
in the credit rating of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (provided that the
exception in this clause (I) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a

clause (iii), to the extent disproportionately affecting Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other similarly situated companies
in the industries in which Parent and its Subsidiaries operate.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the SEC since January 1, 2017 (all such documents and
reports filed or furnished by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
information set forth in the Parent SEC Documents as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including 

 



\- 31 -

    

 the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto).

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of
Parent GP as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management of Parent GP has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of
internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date hereof,
management of Parent GP has disclosed to Parents auditors and the audit
committee of the Board of Directors of Parent GP (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect in any material respect Parents ability to report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal
control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and
fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Company
prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or
reserved against in Parents consolidated balance sheet as of the Balance
Sheet Date (including the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents,
(b) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business and (d) for liabilities and
obligations that have been discharged or paid in full, neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), other than those that would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Compliance with_ _Law_ _; Permits_. (a) Parent and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and are not in default under or in
violation of, any applicable Law, except where such non-compliance, default or
violation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2017, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to Parents knowledge, other
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible
violation of, or failure to comply with, any Law, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



\- 32 -

    

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,

Governmental Entities, and have filed all tariffs, reports, notices and other
documents with all Governmental Entities necessary for Parent and its
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets and to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent_
_Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits or to
have filed such tariffs, reports, notices or other documents would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent
Permits are valid and in full force and effect and are not subject to any
administrative or judicial proceeding that could result in modification,
termination or revocation thereof, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect or any modification, termination, or revocation thereof would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent is, and each of its Subsidiaries is, in compliance in all respects
with the terms and requirements of such Parent Permits, except where the
failure to be in compliance would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.8 _Environmental Laws_ _and Regulations_. Except as would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (i)
there are no investigations, actions, suits or proceedings (whether
administrative or judicial) pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any person or entity whose
liability Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has retained or assumed either
contractually or by operation of law, alleging non-compliance with or other

Parents Systems that would reasonably be expected to result in a pipeline
integrity failure.

 

Section 4.9 _Employee_ _Benefit Plans_. Except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) each
Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be
contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or under which Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability (contingent or current)
(the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") has been maintained and administered in
compliance with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code to the extent applicable thereto, and (ii) all contributions required to
be made under the terms of any Parent Benefit Plan have been timely made or,
if not yet due, have been properly reflected in Parents financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. Except as set forth on Section 4.9 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains,
contributes to or is required to contribute to, or has any liability
(including on behalf of or in respect of an ERISA Affiliate) with respect to,

Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (vi)
unless the Board of Directors of the Company, or any committee thereof,

inconsistent with the fiduciary duties the Board of Directors of the Company
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, amend or grant any
waiver, release or modification under, or fail to enforce, any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the

agreed that such confidentiality agreement between the Company and such person
shall permit such person to make any Acquisition Proposal to the Board of
Directors of the Company), and to the extent such non-public information has
not been made available to Parent, the Company provides or makes available
such non-public information to Parent substantially concurrent with the time

with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) the Company complies
with the obligations set forth in the proviso in _Section_ __ _ 5.4(g)_. So

has made an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to
request the clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to

to result in, a Superior Offer, and any such actions shall not be a breach of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_.

(b) The Company shall promptly, and in no event later than twenty-
four (24) hours after its or any of its Representatives receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations

request (including providing the identity of the person making or submitting

material respects on a prompt basis with respect to any change to the material
terms of any such Acquisition Proposal (and in no event later than twenty-
four (24) hours following any such change).

(c) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, employees and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions
existing as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
Representatives and any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives) that relate to
any Acquisition Proposal.

propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, including by failing to include
the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus; (ii) approve,
adopt, authorize, resolve or recommend, or propose to approve, adopt,
authorize, resolve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar Contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with
respect to, or in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) fail
to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) business days of a
request therefor by Parent following the date on which any Acquisition
Proposal or material modification thereto is received by the Company or is
published, sent or communicated to the Companys stockholders; _provided_
that if the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled to be held within five
(5) business days of such request, within three (3) business days after such
request and, in any event, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting (provided, that Parent may not make any such request on more than two
(2) occasions with respect to each Acquisition Proposal, which for these
purposes includes any revision, amendment, update or supplement to such
Acquisition Proposal); (iv) fail to publicly announce, within five (5)
business days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the
securities of the Company shall have been commenced, a statement disclosing
that the Board of Directors of the Company recommends rejection of such tender
offer or exchange offer and affirms the Company Recommendation; or (v) approve
any transaction under, or any third party becoming, an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL (or similar concepts under any

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may
at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, make a
Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.1(h)_, if (and only if): (i) (A) a written Acquisition Proposal (that
did not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_) is made by a
third party after the date hereof, and such Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn, (B) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer and (C) following
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors of the
Company determines that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Board of Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law; and (ii) (A) the Company provides Parent seventy-two (72)
hours prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice
shall include the information with respect to such Superior Offer that is
specified in _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_, (B) after providing such notice and
prior to making such Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior
Offer or taking any action pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ with respect to
a Superior Offer, the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent
during such seventy-two (72) hour period (to the extent that Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement, such that
the Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Offer, and (C) the
Board of Directors of the Company

 



\- 50 -

    

 shall have considered in good faith any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and following such seventy-two (72)
hour period, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Offer if such changes of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent were to be given effect; _provided_
that, in the event that the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter modified by the
party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written
notice of such modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again comply with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(e) , except_ that the required seventy-two (72) hour
period for notice, negotiation and consideration in clauses (A), (B) and (C)
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_ shall be shortened to a forty-eight (48) hour
period in each instance.

 

(f) Other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall be subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section_ __ _
5.4(f)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of
Directors of the Company from making a Change of Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event to the extent that (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company, or any committee thereof, determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (ii) (A) the Company provides Parent seventy-two (72)
hours prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice
shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) after providing such notice and prior
to making such Change of Recommendation, the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent during such seventy-two (72) hour period (to the extent that
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as to obviate the need for the Board of Directors to make a Change
of Recommendation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(f)_, and (C) the Board
of Directors of the Company, or any committee thereof, shall have considered
in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered in writing by
Parent, and following such seventy-two (72) hour period, shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Board of Directors of the
Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

(g) Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided, however_ ,
that any such disclosure that addresses or relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors
of the Company with respect to this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Board of Directors
of the Company in connection with such communication publicly states that its
recommendation with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to
the prior recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company.

than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking
into account at the time of determination any proposal by Parent to amend or
modify the terms of this Agreement which are committed to in writing and after
taking into account such factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of
the Company, or any committee thereof, including the form of consideration,
timing, likelihood of consummation, required approvals, conditions to
consummation, and other factors that the Board of Directors may consider in
the exercise of its fiduciary duties).

 

Section 5.5 _Filings; Other_ _Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Form S-4, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the Companys stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take
any action required to be taken under any applicable state or provincial
securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of Common
Units in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made
by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the others prior consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and
without providing the other party a

 



\- 53 -

    

 reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or the Company,
as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral or
written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Common Units issuable in connection
with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies
of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent
or the Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to duly give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, to be held as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act, to consider the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders_
__ _Meeting_ "). The Company will, except in the case of a Change of
Recommendation, through its Board of Directors, recommend that its
stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or
applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may, in consultation with Parent, postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) if there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock present to
constitute a quorum to conduct business at such meeting, (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure that the Company has determined after consultation
with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or (iv)
if the Company has delivered any notice contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.4(e)_ and the time periods contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_ have not
expired.

 

Section 5.6 _Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Each award of restricted share units that corresponds to Shares and
vests solely based on the passage of time (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ "),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent
and converted into a restricted unit award with respect to 

 



\- 54 -

    

 Common Units (each an " _Assumed RSU Award_ "). Each Assumed RSU Award shall
be converted into a restricted unit award to receive a number of Common Units
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Shares subject
to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) a
ratio equal to (A)(1) the Per Share Cash Amount divided by (2) the closing
price of one Common Unit on the NYSE on the day prior to the Closing Date
plus (B) the Exchange Ratio (such ratio, the " _Equity Exchange Ratio_ "),
rounded up or down to the nearest whole Common Unit. Each Assumed RSU Award
shall (i) otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including as
to vesting and issuance) as were applicable to the Company RSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) fully accelerate upon a
termination without "cause," for "good reason" or a result of the holders
death or disability (as such terms are defined in Section 5.6(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule).

 

(b) Each award of performance share units that corresponds to Shares (each,
a " _Company PSU Award_ "), that is outstanding and vested as of the
Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled in exchange for
the payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to the number of Shares
equal to the total number of Shares with respect to which such Company PSU
Award has vested prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall
issue to the holders of Company PSU Awards the Merger Consideration in respect
of the applicable number of Shares described in the immediately preceding
sentence, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
the making of such payment, within five business days following the Effective
Time. Each Company PSU Award that is outstanding and unvested as of the
Effective Time shall automatically, and without any required action of the
holder thereof, be cancelled without consideration.

 

(c) Each award of restricted Company Common Stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ,"
together with the Company RSU Awards and the Company PSU Awards, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a
restricted unit award with respect to Common Units (each an " _Assumed
Restricted Stock Award_ "). Each Assumed Restricted Stock Award shall be
converted into a restricted unit award representing a contractual right upon
vesting to receive a number of Common Units equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Shares subject to such Assumed Restricted Stock
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the _Equity Exchange
Ratio_ , rounded up or down to the nearest whole Common Unit. Each Assumed
Restricted Stock Award shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including as to vesting and issuance) as were applicable to the
Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each
Assumed Restricted Stock Award shall (i) otherwise be subject to the same
terms and conditions (including as to vesting and issuance) as were applicable
to the Company Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
have distribution equivalent rights, and (iii) fully accelerate upon a
termination without "cause," for "good reason" or a result of the holders
death or disability (as such terms are defined in Section 5.6(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Restricted Share and
Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is held by a non-employee director of the Board of Directors (a "
_Director Restricted Share Award_ ") shall, 

 



\- 55 -

    

 as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and shall be cancelled in
exchange for the payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to the total
number of Shares subject to such Director Restricted Share Award. The
Surviving Corporation shall issue to the holders of Director Restricted Share
Awards the Merger Consideration in respect of the applicable number of Shares
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within
five (5) business days following the Effective Time.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee thereof, and,
if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that may be necessary or
required under the ESPP and applicable Laws to ensure that (i) no new
offering period under the ESPP shall begin after September 30, 2019; (ii) with
respect to the current offering period set to end on September 30, 2019 any
remaining contributions held in the participant accounts under the ESPP
after the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock at the end of such
offering period shall be returned to the participant (without interest) after
the last business day of the offering, (iii) the ESPP shall terminate in its
entirety immediately prior to the Closing and no further rights shall be
granted or exercised under the ESPP thereafter. Notwithstanding any
restrictions on transfer of stock in the ESPP, all shares of Company Common
Stock purchased under the ESPP shall be treated in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)_.

(f) The Company shall take any and all actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_.

 

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time and until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to,
provide the individuals who are employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time (the " _Current Employees_
") and who continue employment during such time period with (i) annual base
salary or wages (as applicable) that are no less favorable than the annual
base salary or wages (as applicable) provided to such Current Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance benefits in effect for such Current
Employees as immediately prior to the Effective Time, as set forth on Section
5.7(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (iii) other compensation
and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
either, at Parents election, (A) the other compensation and employee benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, or
(B) the other compensation and employee benefits provided to such Current
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding equity
compensation, defined benefit and supplemental pensions and retiree medical
benefits).

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and, solely for
vacation and paid time off policies, severance plans and policies, and
disability plans and policies, determining levels of benefits (but not, for
the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and
its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Current Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New_

 



\- 56 -

    

  _Plans_ "), each Current Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Current
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Current Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (i) each Current Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which
such Current Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Current Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to
entry in the New Plans, was subject to the same such conditions under the
comparable Old Plans, and (iii) credit amounts paid under any Old Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits under any
corresponding New Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and
out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the New Plan with respect to the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Benefit
Plans_ " means any (i) "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ ")), (ii) bonus, incentive or deferred compensation or equity or
equity-based compensation plan, program, policy or arrangement, including
employer stock and incentive plans, (iii) severance, change in
control, employment, consulting, retirement, retention or termination plan,
program, agreement, policy or arrangement or (iv) other compensation or
benefit plan, program, agreement, policy, practice, contract, arrangement or
other obligation, whether or not in writing and whether or not subject to
ERISA, including all bonus, cash or equity-based incentive, deferred
compensation, stock purchase, health, medical, dental, disability, accident,
life insurance, or vacation, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit,
severance, change of control, retention, employment, separation, retirement,
pension, or savings, plans, programs, policies, agreements or arrangements.

 

(c) Each Current Employee who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
is eligible for an annual bonus under a Company Benefit Plan for 2019, is
employed by the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates on December 31, 2019
and is not terminated for cause (as defined in Section 5.7(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) shall receive an annual bonus for 2019 (to the extent
such bonus is not otherwise paid prior to the Effective Time) in an amount
equal to not less than 100% of the target amount of such bonus (the " _2019
Annual Bonuses_ "); provided that if such Current Employee is terminated
without cause (as such term is defined in Section 5.7(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) prior to December 31, 2019, such Current Employee shall
remain entitled to receive a pro-rated portion of his or her 2019 Annual
Bonus based on the number of days such Current Employee was employed during
the 2019 calendar year. The 2019 Annual Bonuses shall be payable no later than
date annual bonuses are paid to Parents other similarly situated employees,
but in any event before March 15, 2020.

 



\- 57 -

    

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior
to the Effective Time, as applicable.

 

(e) If requested by Parent, subject to the terms of any such Company
Benefit Plan and applicable Law, the Company shall both (i) terminate any
Company Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing
a Code Section 401(k) cash or deferred arrangement (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_
") and (ii) fully vest each Current Employee in his or her account balance in
such Company 401(k) Plan, in each case, effective at least one day prior to
the Closing Date (the " _ERISA Effective Date_ "). Prior to the ERISA
Effective Date, the Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of
its or, as applicable, its Subsidiarys Board of Directors authorizing such
termination and amending any such Company 401(k) Plan commensurate with its
termination to the extent necessary to comply with all applicable Laws. The
Company shall also take and/or cause its Subsidiaries to take such other
actions in furtherance of the termination of each Company 401(k) Plan as
Parent may reasonably require, including such actions as Parent may require
prior to the Effective Time to support Parent obtaining a determination
letter with respect to the termination of each Company 401(k) Plan following
the ERISA Effective Date.

 

(f) In the event of the termination, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.7(d)_,
of any Company 401(k) Plan (each such terminated Company 401(k) Plan, a "
_Terminated Company 401(k) Plan_ "), Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall
cause a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, that includes a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code and that is established or maintained by Parent or
its applicable Subsidiary (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to immediately accept
eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to such individuals account balances (including loans) under such
Terminated Company 401(k) Plan, if elected by any such individuals. The
rollovers described herein shall comply with applicable Law, and Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall make all filings and take any actions required of such
party under applicable Law in connection therewith. Current and former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are participants in a
Terminated Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be eligible immediately as of the Effective Time to participate in a Parent
401(k) Plan.

(g) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to amend the Key Employee Severance Plan and the Severance Pay Plan as set
forth on Section 5.7(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(h) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall be construed as an amendment
of, or undertaking to amend, any Benefit Plan or to prevent the amendment or
termination of any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Current Employee at any time, subject to any rights to severance or other
separation benefits accrued as of the applicable termination date under a
Company Benefit Plan. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _
8.13_, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former director, officer,
employee, other service provider or independent contractor or any other
person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this

 



\- 58 -

    

 Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement
(including any Benefit Plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries) for any purpose.

the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use
its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or

after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former,
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a
period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any of its
Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar

Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;  _provided,
however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending
or asserted or any

 



\- 61 -

    

 claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such
Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and
stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in accordance with their respective terms,
each of the covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ without limit
as to time.

the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless
(and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and
former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to the extent required by with the Company
Organizational Documents and the DGCL to repay such amounts if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,

investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission by them in their capacities as such occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions in connection with such Indemnified Party serving
as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event
of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
in effect as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters existing or arising on or before the Effective Time;
_provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums
in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverages (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required
to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. If the Company in its sole
discretion elects, then the Company may, prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or
alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity
as such;  _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such policy exceed
six (6) times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased,
Parent shall have no further obligations under this  _Section_ __ _
5.11(c)_. If a "tail policy" is purchased, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _
5.11_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party shall be in addition to, and not
in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

 

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations of such party set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release,
waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees,
it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such
claims under any such policies.

(g) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any
manner so as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their
successors, heirs and legal representatives) to whom this _Section_ __ _
5.11_ applies without the consent of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly
agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be
to the contrary, (i) the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section_ __ _
5.11_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
5.11_, and (ii) this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their
respective successors, heirs and legal representatives against Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand
and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
partys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 

Section 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any

derivative securities with respect to Common Units) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Section 5.14 _Intended Tax Treatment_. Parent and the Company each
acknowledges and agrees that, for U.S. federal income and applicable state and
local tax purposes and pursuant to the Merger, each holder of Company Common
Stock will be deemed to contribute its Company Common Stock to Parent
in exchange for Merger Consideration and the deemed assumption of each such
holders share of the liabilities of Parent pursuant to Section 752 of the
Code. Parent and Company each acknowledges and agrees that, for U.S. federal
income and applicable state and local tax purposes, such deemed transaction
is intended to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss pursuant to Section
721 of the Code but will be characterized as a disguised sale transaction
described in section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code with respect to any amounts
treated as a transfer of consideration pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.707-3(a)(1) (such treatment, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). Unless
required to do so as a result of a "determination" as defined in Section 1313
of the Code, each of Parent and Company agrees not to make any tax filings or
otherwise take any position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and
to cooperate with the other party to make any filings, statements, or reports
required to effect, disclose or report the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

Section 5.15 _NYSE_ _Listing_. Parent shall cause the Common Units to be
issued in the Merger and such other Common Units to be reserved for issuance

Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent such
reasonable and customary cooperation in connection with any financing by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, in each case
as may be reasonably requested by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, upon
reasonable request, (i) furnish the report of the Companys auditor on the
three most recently available audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
consent of such auditor to the use of such reports, including in documents

and practice and use reasonable best efforts to cause such auditor to provide
customary comfort letters to the arrangers, underwriters, initial purchasers
or placement agents, as applicable, in connection with any such financing;
(ii) furnish any additional financial statements, schedules, business or other
financial data relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be

the Securities Act or as may be customary in connection with any such
financing; (iii) provide direct contact between (x) senior management and
advisors, including auditors, of the Company and (y) the proposed arrangers,
lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as applicable,
and/or Parents auditors, as applicable, in connection with any

 



\- 64 -

Parent or its Subsidiaries to fulfill conditions or obligations under the
financing documents, provided that such agreements shall be conditioned upon,
and shall not take effect until, the Effective Time; (vii) assist in the
preparation of one or more confidential information memoranda, prospectuses,
offering memoranda and other marketing and syndication materials reasonably
requested by Parent; (viii) permit Parent or its Subsidiaries reasonable use
of the Companys and its Subsidiaries logos for syndication and underwriting,
as applicable, in connection with any such financing (subject to advance
review of and consultation with respect to such use), (ix) participate in a
reasonable number of meetings and presentations with arrangers and prospective
lenders and investors, as applicable (including the participation in such
meetings of the Companys senior management), in each case at times and
locations to be mutually agreed, and (x) use commercially reasonable efforts
to assist in procuring any necessary rating agency ratings or approvals.

none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives shall be required
to (x) pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any
other liability in connection with any financing prior to the Effective Time,
(y) enter into any definitive agreement the effectiveness of which is not
conditioned upon the Closing; or (z) give any indemnities that are effective
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (iii) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and against any and all losses or damages actually suffered
or incurred by them directly in connection with the arrangement of any such
financing (other than to the extent related to information provided by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives). In addition,
no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to any
financing will be effective until the Effective Time, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any action pursuant to
any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument that is not
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to
the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ will require the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives to execute,
deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement, document or instrument,
including any definitive financing document, with respect to any financing or
adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and/or instruments
pursuant to which any financing is obtained or pledge any collateral with
respect to any financing prior to the Closing. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
5.16_ shall require (A) any officer or Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or take any other action under
this

 



\- 65 -

    

  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ that could reasonably be expected to result in
personal liability to such officer or Representative; or (B) the Board of
Directors of the Company to approve any financing or contracts related
thereto prior to the Effective Time (it being understood and agreed that all
such certificates, opinions or resolutions shall be delivered by any officer
or board members of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time). The Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives shall not be
required to deliver any legal opinions or solvency certificates.

 

(c) At the request of Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent at least
two business days prior to the Closing Date payoff letters from any third-
party lenders (or agents therefor), trustees, or other holders of indebtedness
of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or representatives therefor), as
applicable, in the customary forms of such lenders, trustees or other holder
of indebtedness or otherwise in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, with
respect to the indebtedness or obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
set forth in Section 5.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. At the sole
cost and expense of Parent, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent in replacing any letters of credit issued pursuant to the facilities
evidencing the above referenced indebtedness or obligations.

 

(d) The Company shall, at the request of Parent, (i) call for prepayment or
redemption, or prepay or redeem, (ii) attempt to renegotiate the terms of,
(iii) commence an offer to purchase and/or consent solicitation or (iv)
satisfy and discharge or defease any then-existing indebtedness for borrowed
money of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to make or cause
to become effective any such action (nor shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to incur any cost or liability in respect thereof)
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any redemption,
prepayment or other payment made to satisfy and discharge or defease such
portion of the Company Indebtedness prior to or at the Closing shall be the
obligation of Parent. Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate
documentation in connection with any action described above, and provide the
Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents. Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or prior to June 30, 2020 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided,
however_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing, other than the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ or 

 



\- 68 -

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_, shall have been satisfied or shall be capable of
being satisfied at such time, the End Date shall automatically be extended to
September 30, 2020, which date shall thereafter be deemed to be the End Date;
_provided, further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to a party if the failure
of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the material breach by
such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of
such party set forth in this Agreement;

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if an injunction or other Law shall
have been entered, enacted or become effective permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such
injunction or other Law has become final and nonappealable; _provided,
however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __
_ 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to a party if such injunction was due to the
failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

if it occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in
a failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ or _Section_
__ _ 6.2(b)_ and (ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date
or, if such breach or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date,
Parent does not diligently attempt or ceases to diligently attempt to cure
such breach or failure after receiving written notice from the Company
describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail (provided that the
Company is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein);

(f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred or was
continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ and
(ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach
or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company does not
diligently attempt, or ceases to diligently attempt, to cure such breach or
failure in such a manner that would make it reasonably likely that such breach
or failure will be cured prior to the End Date, in each case after receiving
written notice from Parent describing such breach or failure in reasonable
detail (provided that Parent is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);

any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,

otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an

by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided, however_ ,
that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or
waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the NYSE require further approval of the stockholders of the
Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the
approval of the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.
