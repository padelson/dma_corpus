                              TRANSFER AGREEMENT


      TRANSFER AGREEMENT dated as of August 13, 2000 (the "Agreement"), among
The News Corporation Limited, a South Australia corporation ("News"), News
Publishing Australia Limited, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of News ("NPAL"), FEG Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of News ("FEGH") and Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("FEG").

      WHEREAS, FEG desires to acquire certain assets (the "Transferred Assets"
of Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Chris-Craft"), BHC
Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("BHC"), and United Television,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("UTV"; collectively the "Acquired Entities");

      WHEREAS, the Acquired Entities have agreed to be acquired, in exchange for
Preferred Limited Voting Ordinary Shares of News and cash;

      WHEREAS, in order to effectuate the foregoing, News, NPAL and Fox
Television Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
FEG, have this day entered into a separate Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as
of August 13, 2000 with each of the Acquired Entities (such agreements, the
"Merger Agreements");

      WHEREAS, FEG has agreed to issue, and FEGH has agreed to accept, in
consideration for the transfer to FEG of the Transferred Assets or Preferred
Limited Voting Ordinary Shares of News to effectuate the acquisition of the
Acquired Entities, as the case may be, shares of FEG's Class A Common Stock, par
value $.01 per share (the "Class A Common Stock").

      NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

      1. Transfer.  At the effective time of the Mergers or as soon as
         --------
practicable thereafter (the "Closing"), FEGH shall, in the case of a Forward
Merger, transfer and assign, or cause the transfer and assignment of, the
Transferred Assets (the "Transfer") to FEG or a subsidiary thereof. The parties
hereto agree that the Transferred Assets shall include all the assets of the
Acquired Entities on the Closing Date (subject to all liabilities of the
Acquired Entities, including, without limitation, liabilities incurred in
connection with the Mergers), except for $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents,
marketable securities and other investments (collectively, "Cash");
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transferred Assets shall not include, and FEG
shall not assume any liability with respect to, the plastics business conducted
by the Acquired Entities (the "Plastics Business"). In the case of a Reverse
Merger, FEG or a subsidiary of FEG shall assume the obligations of NPAL under
the Merger Agreements and shall acquire by merger the Acquired Entities. In the
case of a Reverse Merger, at the Closing or as soon as practicable thereafter,
FEG shall cause the

      2. Consideration.  In consideration for the above transfer, at the
         -------------
Closing, FEG shall issue to FEGH the following number of shares of Class A
Common Stock:

           (1)  in the case of a Forward Merger, FEG shall issue to FEGH
                122,244,272 shares of Class A Common Stock; or

           (2)  in the case of a Reverse Merger, FEG shall issue to FEGH
                114,462,900 shares of Class A Common Stock.

      The parties agree that the foregoing number of shares shall be adjusted as
a result of any adjustment to the consideration required to be paid under the
Merger Agreements.

     3. Representations; Warranties and Agreements.
        ------------------------------------------

        3.1  Each of the parties hereto hereby represents and warrants that is
has all requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to execute and

duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of
each of the parties hereto.

                  and

             (2)  the number of share of Class A Common Stock that FEG will

                  stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations or similar
