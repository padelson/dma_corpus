thereafter represent the right to receive one share of TCM Series A Preferred

Series E Affiliated Stockholder) and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished and thereafter represent
the right receive $1,000; and   (v) each share of Series F Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished and thereafter represent the right to receive 22.56 shares of

shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to

to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of TCM Capital Stock upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.07, without interest. The right of any Company
Stockholder to receive its portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Section 2.06(c) shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of
any withholding that is required under applicable tax law.   (d) Stock
Options. All options to purchase Company Common Stock granted pursuant to the
Company\'s 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the "1994 Plan"), or

dividing the accrued and unpaid dividends due on such shares by 1,000;
provided that no fractional shares of TCM Series A Preferred Stock shall be
issued upon conversion and, upon such conversion, the actual number of shares
of TCM Series A Preferred Stock ultimately issued to any holder shall have

ultimately issued to any holder shall have been rounded down to the nearest

procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock for the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:  
(a) Exchange Agent. At or promptly following the Effective Time, TCM
shall deposit with Mellon Investor Services, LLC (the "Exchange Agent"), for
the benefit of the Company Stockholders, for exchange in accordance with
this Section 2.07, through the Exchange Agent, (i)    12    the
certificates representing shares of TCM Common Stock issuable pursuant
to Section 2.06(c)(i) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, (ii) the certificates representing shares of TCM Series A Preferred
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.06(c)(ii), Section 2.06(c)(iii) and
2.06(e)(ii), (iii) the cash payable pursuant to Section 2.06(c)(iv), (iv) the
TCM Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.06(c)(v) and Section
2.06(e)(iii), and (v) the TCM Series B Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.06(f).   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no later than five (5)
business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record (as of the Effective Time) of a Certificate whose shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.06(c) into the applicable Merger
Consideration (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of TCM Common
Stock as provided in Section 2.07(e)) (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as TCM may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
applicable Merger Consideration (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, of TCM Common Stock as provided in Section 2.07(e)). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by TCM, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, pursuant to
Section 2.07(e), and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Capital Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable
Merger Consideration issued (and if applicable, paid) in exchange therefor
plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, pursuant to Section 2.07(e)
may be issued and paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
with respect to such transfer have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.07(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, pursuant to Section 2.07(e).   (c) Distributions
with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of TCM
Capital Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of
TCM Capital Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such
Certificate surrenders such Certificate. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the
record holder of the Certificate, (i) the applicable Merger Consideration,
(ii) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of TCM
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07(e),
without interest and (iii) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time payable with respect to such
whole shares of TCM Capital Stock, without interest.    13     (d) No
Registration of Transfers. From and after the Effective Time there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of any Company Capital Stock that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.   (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of TCM Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of TCM. Fractional shares of TCM Common Stock will be aggregated
and sold in the market by the Exchange Agent at the then prevailing prices.
The aggregated net cash proceeds of those sales will be distributed ratably
to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of TCM Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder). No interest will be payable upon any such cash
payment. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in
lieu of issuing fractional shares of TCM Common Stock was not separately
bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting problems that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of TCM Common
Stock.   (f) Return of Merger Consideration. Subject to Section 2.07(g), any
portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to the
Company Stockholders for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to TCM, upon demand, and any Company Stockholder who has not exchanged such
Company Stockholder\'s shares of Company Capital Stock for such Company
Stockholder\'s portion of the applicable Merger Consideration shall
thereafter look only to TCM, as an unsecured creditor for payment of its
claim for the applicable Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto.   (g) No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none
of TCM, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person for any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable at Closing (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (h) Withholding
Rights. Each of TCM, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.   (i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such portion of the   
14    applicable Merger Consideration; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation may, in its sole discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance and delivery thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.   SECTION 2.08 Dissenters\' Rights.
Notwithstanding Section 2.06(c), if any Dissenting Stockholder that is
entitled to dissenters\' rights demands to be paid the "fair value" of such
holder\'s shares of Company Capital Stock (as provided in Section 14-2-1323
of Georgia Law) and complies with all conditions and obligations necessary to
perfect dissenters\' rights in accordance with Article 13 of Georgia Law,
such shares of Company Capital Stock shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration except as provided in this Section 2.08, and
the Company shall give TCM prompt (and in any event no later than the second
business day after receipt thereof) notice thereof and TCM shall have the
right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands and to receive any related notices. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
no later than the second business day after receipt thereof) deliver to TCM a
copy of all notices of intent to demand payment delivered to the Company
in compliance with Section 14-2-1321 of Georgia Law. Neither the Company nor
the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior written consent of
TCM, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent,
the shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall
thereupon be treated as though such shares had been converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.06.   ARTICLE III.  REPRESENTATIONS

Financial Statements.   (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and
documents required to be filed by it pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since
August 31, 2003 (collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"). The Company SEC
Reports (i) were prepared in compliance in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of the Company\'s subsidiaries is required to file
any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.   (b) The consolidated
financial statements (including, in each case, the related notes thereto)
contained in the Company SEC Reports were prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of its operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the
unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be,
material in amount and such statements do not contain notes required
by GAAP.   (c) Since the date of the latest Company SEC Report that
included the certifications required by Rule 13a-14(a) of the Exchange Act,
the Company has not materially and adversely amended its disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) or its
internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act), as previously described in its Company SEC Reports. The
Company has made available to TCM, complete and correct copies of, all formal
written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other documents
promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures.   (d) Since the date
of the latest Company SEC Report that included the certifications required by
Rule 13a-14(a) of the Exchange Act, neither the Company nor any subsidiary
nor, to the Company\'s knowledge, any member of the audit committee or

Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

compensation or benefits due to any employee, director or stockholder of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or

labor disputes, including, without limitation, charges of unfair labor

subsidiaries at any time during the past three years, except where any such
action would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.14

extensions), and have timely paid and discharged    24    all material
Taxes required to be paid (whether or not shown on such Tax Returns), other
than Taxes the payment of which is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings. The most recent financial statements contained
in the Company SEC Reports reflect, with respect to any liability for Taxes
of the Company and its subsidiaries for any years ended on or before the date
of such Company SEC Reports and either not finally determined or with respect
to which the applicable statute of limitations has not expired, an adequate
reserve to satisfy any assessment for such Taxes for such years. All federal
income Tax Returns and all other Tax Returns filed by each of the Company and
its subsidiaries with respect to Taxes are true and correct in all
material respects. Copies of all federal, state and foreign income Tax
Returns for the three years preceding the Closing Date that are true,
complete and correct in all material respects have been previously provided
or made available to TCM. Neither the IRS nor any other taxing authority or
agency is now asserting or, to the Company\'s knowledge, threatening to
assert against the Company or any of its subsidiaries any deficiency or claim

or any of its subsidiaries that would affect its or any of their liability
for Taxes for any period after the Effective Time; and (iv) neither the

(other than the Company and its subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any similar state, local or foreign provision.   (c)

Law, including , without limitation, withholding Taxes on Options exercised
prior to the Closing.   (e) The Company is not, nor was it any time during
the five-year period ending on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, a
"United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of

managed or operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Company
Real Property"), comply and have at all times during the Company\'s
ownership, use or operation thereof complied in all material respects with
all applicable Environmental Laws. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other person,
has engaged in, authorized, allowed or suffered any operations or activities
upon any of the Company Real Property for the purpose of or in any way
involving the handling, manufacture, treatment, processing, storage, use,
generation, release, discharge, emission, dumping or disposal of any
Hazardous Substances at, on or under the Company Real Property, except in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.   (b) Neither the Assets
nor the Company Real Property contain any Hazardous Substances in, on, over,
under or at it in concentrations which would presently violate Environmental
Laws or impose liability or obligations on the present or former owner,
manager, or operator of the Company Real Property under the Environmental
Laws for any investigation, corrective action, remediation or monitoring of
Hazardous Substances in, on, over, under or at the Company Real Property.
None of the Company Real Property is listed or proposed for listing on the

Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (c) There are no underground storage
tanks, asbestos or asbestos containing materials, polychlorinated biphenyls,

presently owned, managed or operated Company Real Property.   (d) To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no conditions existing at any Company
Real Property or with respect to the Assets, that require, or which with the
giving of notice or the passage of time or both may require remedial
or corrective action, removal or closure pursuant to the Environmental
Laws.   (e) The Company has provided or made available to TCM all
material environmental reports, assessments, audits, studies, investigations,
data and other material written    26    environmental information in
its custody, possession or control concerning the Company, its subsidiaries,
the Assets or the Company Real Property.   (f) Neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries has contractually, or to the knowledge of the Company, by
operation of law, by the Environmental Laws, by common law or otherwise
assumed or succeeded to any Environmental Liabilities of any predecessors or
any other person.   SECTION 3.16 Brokers. Except for those fees and expenses
payable to the Company Financial Advisor, no broker, finder or investment

furnished to TCM a complete and correct copy of all agreements between the
Company and the Company Financial Advisor, pursuant to which such firm would
be entitled to any payment relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 3.17 Material Contracts. All of the material contracts
that are required to be described in the Company SEC Reports or required to

violations or defaults that individually or in the aggregate have not and
could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 3.18 Title to Properties; Absence of Encumbrances. The
Company has title to, or leasehold interests in, its properties sufficient to

except (i) for those securing Taxes, assessments and other governmental
charges or levies not yet due and payable (excluding any imposed pursuant to
any of the provisions of ERISA), (ii) as listed in Section 3.18 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, (iii) such imperfections in title, liens and
easements as do not materially detract from or interfere with the use of the
properties subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair
business operations involving such properties, and (iv) Encumbrances securing
debt that is reflected in the most recent financial statements contained in
the Company SEC Reports (each of the Encumbrances set forth in (i) through
(iv), a "Permitted Encumbrance") that individually or in the aggregate have
not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and its subsidiaries have all patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, know-how, processes and
all agreements and other rights necessary to carry on their business in
substantially the same manner as now conducted. The patents, trademarks and
copyrights owned by the Company are valid and enforceable and to the
knowledge of the Company do not infringe on the rights of any persons.  
SECTION 3.19 Insurance. The Company and its subsidiaries maintain policies of
fire and casualty, liability and other forms of insurance in such
amounts, with such deductibles and against such risks and losses as are, in
the Company\'s judgment, reasonable for the assets and properties of the
Company and its subsidiaries and customary in the Company\'s industry,

Material Adverse Effect and except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the

of cancellation or termination has been received by the Company with respect
to any such policy.   SECTION 3.20 Tax Matters. None of the Company, any of
its subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers,
employees or agents has taken, or agreed or failed to take, any action that
to their knowledge would prevent the Merger from constituting a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of
their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents is
aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the
Merger from constituting a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.   SECTION 3.21 Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the
holders of (x) a majority of each class of the then outstanding shares of
Company Preferred Stock, each voting separately as a single class, and (y) a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote
on the Merger is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Company Capital Stock necessary to approve or adopt this Agreement, the
Merger or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Company Stockholders\' Vote Condition"). For purposes of the Company
Stockholders\' Vote Condition, each outstanding share of Company Common Stock
and each outstanding share of Company Preferred Stock is entitled to one

Agreement, the Merger and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby by the Company Board referred to in Section
3.04(b) constitutes approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for purposes
of Section 14-2-1132 of Georgia Law and represents the only action necessary
to ensure that Section 14-2-1132 of Georgia Law does not and will not apply
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements
or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby (other than the Spin-off) or thereby. No other state takeover or
similar statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has no
shareholder rights or "poison pill" that would be applicable to the Merger,
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.   SECTION 3.23 Fairness Opinion. The Company has received
the written opinion of the Company Financial Advisor, in customary form and
based on customary assumptions, to the effect that the Common Stock Exchange
Ratio is fair to the holders of the Company Common Stock (other than J. Mack
Robinson and other affiliated stockholders of the Company). The Company has
delivered to TCM a true, correct and complete copy of such opinion. The
Company has been authorized by the Company Financial Advisor to permit the
inclusion of such    28    opinion (and, subject to prior review and
consent by the Company Financial Advisor, a reference thereto) in the Company
Proxy Statement.   SECTION 3.24 No Other Representations and Warranties.

uncertainties, that the Company is taking full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, and that the Company, in the
absence of fraud, or except as provided in the next sentence, shall have no
claim against TCM or any of its subsidiaries or any other person acting on
their behalf with respect thereto whether before or after the execution and

its subsidiaries make any representation or warranty with respect to such
estimates, projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and
plans, except that TCM and its subsidiaries had a reasonable basis to make
such estimates, projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts
and plans. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this Section
3.24(b) shall be construed to limit the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Sections 3.06, 3.07, 3.09, 3.10 and 3.18.   ARTICLE

each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing that would not result in a material adverse
effect on the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise),
assets, properties (including intangible properties) or liabilities of TCM
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Other than Merger Sub and TCM\'s
subsidiaries listed in Section 4.01 of the TCM Disclosure Letter, neither

has heretofore furnished to the Company complete and correct copies of (i)
the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of TCM as of June 30, 2005 and the

GAAP, and (ii) the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 and the related consolidated
statements of income and cash flows for three years ended December 31, 2004,

Financial Statements (including, in each case, the related notes thereto) was
prepared in accordance with the books and records of TCM and its subsidiaries
and in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes
thereto), and each fairly presents the consolidated financial position of TCM
and its subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
results of its operations and cash flows for the    32    periods
indicated consistent with the books and records of TCM, except that the TCM
Interim Financial Statements are subject to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments which will not be material in amount and such TCM Interim
Financial Statements may not contain all notes required by GAAP. The books
and records of TCM are complete and correct in all material respects.  
SECTION 4.08 Registration Statement. The registration statement on Form
S-4 pursuant to which the TCM Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will
be registered with the SEC (including any amendment or supplement thereto)
will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act. The Form S-4
shall not, at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however,
that TCM makes no representation or warranty as to any of the information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion in the
Form S-4.   SECTION 4.09 Compliance, Permits.   (a) Each of TCM and its
subsidiaries, and each of its and its subsidiaries\' properties and
operations, are in compliance with all Laws, applicable to TCM or any of its
subsidiaries or by which any of its or any of its subsidiaries\' properties

would not have a TCM Material Adverse Effect. Neither TCM nor any of its
subsidiaries has received any notice or other communication (whether written

or potential violation of, or any failure to comply with, any Law, except
where any such violation or failure to comply would not have a TCM Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Each of TCM and its subsidiaries possesses all
permits, licenses, consents, franchises, orders, approvals, certifications,
registrations and authorizations from Governmental Entities necessary to

permits, licenses, consents, franchises, orders, approvals, certifications,
registrations and authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws
(collectively, the "TCM Permits"), except where the failure to possess any of
the foregoing would not have a TCM Material Adverse Effect. All of the TCM
Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where any such
invalidity would not have a TCM Material Adverse Effect, and there is no
proceeding pending to revoke, cancel, rescind, refuse to renew in the
ordinary course or modify any of the TCM Permits. Each of TCM and
its subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the TCM
Permits and with all material requirements, standards and procedures of the
Governmental Entities that issued them, and with any limitation or, to the
knowledge of TCM, proposed limitation on any TCM Permit, except where such
non-compliance would not have a TCM Material Adverse Effect, and TCM has no
reasonable basis to believe that the business will not remain capable of
continued operation consistent with past practice and in compliance with the
terms and conditions of the TCM Permits following consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    33     SECTION 4.10
Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in Section 4.10 of

TCM and each of its subsidiaries did not have any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (whether absolute, contingent or otherwise) other than those

in accordance with GAAP or for which adequate reserves are reflected in
TCM\'s financial statements. Since June 30, 2005, except (i) as and to the
extent accrued on the June 30, 2005 balance sheet, (ii) as set forth in
Section 4.11 of the TCM Disclosure Letter, (iii) for liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business and otherwise not in contravention of this
Agreement and (iv) where any liability, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a TCM Material Adverse Effect, TCM and each of its
subsidiaries does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether absolute, contingent or otherwise) other than liabilities and
obligations under this Agreement or incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 4.12 Litigation.
Except as disclosed in Section 4.12 of the TCM Disclosure Letter, there is no
claim, suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of TCM,
threatened against TCM or any of its subsidiaries that individually or in the

Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
action taken or to be taken by TCM or which attempts to restrain, enjoin or
prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as disclosed
in the TCM Disclosure Letter, there is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule
or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against TCM or
any of its subsidiaries which individually or in the aggregate has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a TCM Material Adverse Effect.  
SECTION 4.13 Employees; Labor Matters.   (a) No employee or former employee
of TCM or any of its subsidiaries is owed any wages, benefits or other
compensation for past services (other than wages, benefits and compensation
accrued in the ordinary course of business during the current pay period and
accrued vacation).   (b) There are no labor disputes, including, without
limitation, charges of unfair labor practices within the meaning of the

engaged in any    34    unfair labor practices within the meaning of
the National Labor Relations Act, except where such actions would not have a
TCM Material Adverse Effect. Neither TCM nor any of its subsidiaries is
presently a party to, or is bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or
union contract with respect to any persons employed by TCM or any of its
subsidiaries, and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by
TCM or any of its subsidiaries. To the knowledge of TCM, no organizing
activities are presently being made or are threatened by or on behalf of any
labor union with respect to any employees of TCM or any of its subsidiaries.
TCM has no knowledge of any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages or lockouts,
or threats thereof, by or with respect to any employees of TCM or any of its
subsidiaries, and there have been no such strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages
or lockouts within the past three years. Each of TCM and its subsidiaries is
in compliance with all applicable Laws relating to employment and employment
practices, workers\' compensation, terms and conditions of employment, worker
safety, wages and hours and the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act, except where such non-compliance would not have a TCM Material Adverse
Effect. There has been no harassment, discrimination, retaliatory act or
similar claim against any officer, director or employee of TCM or any of its
subsidiaries at any time during the past three years, except where any such
action would not have a TCM Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.14
Taxes.   (a) Each of TCM and its subsidiaries, and any consolidated,
combined, unitary or aggregate group for Tax purposes of which TCM or any of
its subsidiaries is a member, have timely filed all United States federal

any of them (taking into account applicable extensions), and have timely paid
and discharged all material Taxes required to be paid (whether or not shown
on such Tax Returns), other than Taxes the payment of which is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. The most recent TCM
Financial Statements reflect, with respect to any liability for Taxes of TCM
and its subsidiaries for any years ended on or before the date of such TCM
Financial Statements and either not finally determined or with respect to
which the applicable statute of limitations has not expired, an adequate
reserve to satisfy any assessment for such Taxes for such years. All federal
income Tax Returns and all other Tax Returns filed by or with respect to each

material respects. Copies of all federal, state and foreign income Tax
Returns of or with respect to TCM and its subsidiaries for the three years
preceding the Closing Date that are true, complete and correct in all
material respects have been previously provided or made available to the
Company. Neither the IRS nor any other taxing authority or agency is now
asserting or, to TCM\'s knowledge, threatening to assert against TCM or any
of its subsidiaries any deficiency or claim for material additional Taxes
which have not been paid. There are no requests for information from the IRS
or any other taxing authority or agency currently outstanding with respect to
Taxes of or with respect to TCM or any of its subsidiaries. There are
no pending audits of TCM or any of its subsidiaries by any taxing authority

subsidiaries that would affect its or any of their liability for Taxes for
any period after the Effective Time; and (iv) neither TCM nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liability for Taxes of any person (other than TCM and
its subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
state, local or foreign provision.   (c) Neither TCM nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any agreement (written or oral), except for the

was it any time during the five-year period ending on the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, a "United States real property holding corporation"
within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code.   (f) Neither TCM nor any
of its subsidiaries has any excess loss accounts or deferred intercompany

occupied, managed or operated by TCM or any of its subsidiaries (the "TCM
Real Property"), comply and have at all times during TCM\'s ownership, use or
operation thereof complied in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws. Neither TCM nor any of its subsidiaries, or,
to the knowledge of TCM, any other person, has engaged in, authorized,
allowed or suffered any operations or activities upon any of TCM Real
Property for the purpose of or in any way involving the handling,
manufacture, treatment, processing, storage, use, generation, release,
discharge, emission, dumping or disposal of any Hazardous Substances at, on
or under TCM Real Property, except in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws.   (b) Neither the Assets nor TCM Real Property contain
any Hazardous Substances in, on, over, under or at it in concentrations which
would presently violate Environmental Laws or impose liability or obligations
on the present or former owner, manager, or operator of TCM Real Property
under the Environmental Laws for any investigation, corrective action,
remediation or monitoring of Hazardous Substances in, on, over, under or at
TCM Real Property. None of TCM Real Property is listed or proposed for
listing on the National Priorities List pursuant to    36    CERCLA,
or any similar inventory of sites requiring investigation or
remediation maintained by any state. Neither TCM nor any of its subsidiaries

or corrective action, removal or closure pursuant to the Environmental
Laws.   (e) TCM has provided to the Company all material environmental
reports, assessments, audits, studies, investigations, data and other
material written environmental information in its custody, possession or
control concerning TCM, its subsidiaries, the Assets or TCM Real
Property.   (f) Neither TCM nor any of its subsidiaries has contractually,
or to the knowledge of TCM, by operation of law, by the Environmental Laws,
by common law or otherwise assumed or succeeded to any Environmental
Liabilities of any predecessors or any other person.   SECTION 4.16

parties thereto in accordance with its terms. Neither TCM nor any of its
subsidiaries is in default (and no condition exists that, with notice or

subsidiary) under any Material Contract, which default would give the other
party the right to terminate or modify such Material Contract or would

condition exist that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
a default by any such party). None of the TCM Material Contracts is currently
being renegotiated, and the validity, effectiveness and continuation of each

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as otherwise listed
on Section 4.17 of the TCM Disclosure Letter. To the knowledge of TCM, no
party to any of the TCM Material Contracts has made, asserted or has any
defense, setoff or counterclaim under its Material Contract or has exercised
any option granted to it to cancel, terminate or shorten the term of its
Material Contract.   SECTION 4.18 Title to Properties; Absence of
Encumbrances. TCM has, or at the Effective Time, TCM will have title to, or
leasehold interests in, its properties sufficient to operate such properties
and to conduct its business in the ordinary course, except (i) for those

ERISA), (ii) as listed in Section 4.18 of the TCM Disclosure Letter, (iii)
such imperfections in title, liens and easements as do not materially detract

meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   SECTION 4.21 Employee Benefits.
Each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA

this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 4.20 Tax
Matters. None of TCM, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents has taken, or agreed or
failed to take, any action that to their knowledge would prevent the Merger
from constituting a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of

any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents
is aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent the
Merger from constituting a reorganization with the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.   SECTION 4.21 Employee Benefits. Each "employee

in form and operation with the requirements of applicable Laws and TCM will
take all corporate actions necessary to adopt such plans and comply with

benefit plan" shall be subject to Title IV of ERISA and no such "employee
benefit plan" shall provide for medical or other welfare benefits for former
employees (other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6
of Title I of ERISA). Each such "employee benefit plan" has received or will
apply for a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(which may be the favorable opinion letter of the master and prototype or

Opinions. The special committee of the Board of Directors of TCM and the
Board of Directors of TCM have received the opinion of Houlihan Lokey Howard
and Zukin Capital, Inc. to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and
based upon and subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth in such
opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the Company\'s shareholders
is fair, from a financial point of view, to TCM. TCM has delivered to the
Company true, correct and complete copies of such opinion. TCM has
been authorized by Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Capital, Inc. to permit

(i) the representations and warranties contained in Article III and (ii) in
connection with any information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the

makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the

TCM\'s investigation of the Assets and the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries, TCM may have received or may receive from or on behalf of the

attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that TCM is familiar with such uncertainties, that TCM is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so
furnished to it, and that TCM, in the absence of fraud, or except as provided
in the next sentence, shall have no claim against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any other person acting on their behalf with respect thereto
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing Date. Accordingly, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries make any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forward-looking statements and other forecasts and plans, except that the
Company and its subsidiaries had a reasonable basis to make such estimates,
projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and plans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.23(b) shall be
construed to limit the representations and warranties of TCM contained in
Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.18.   ARTICLE V.  COVENANTS

the TCM Common Stock in the Spin-off and the Company Proxy Statement with
respect to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting. Each of TCM and the Company

shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other
party copies of any written comments, and advise the other party of any oral
comments or communications regarding the Form S-4 received from the SEC. TCM
and the Company shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Form
S-4 prior to filing the same with the SEC, and such parties will provide

in all material respects as to form with the provisions of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of TCM
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning itself, its
subsidiaries, management, financial statements, business and the holders of
its capital stock and shall take all such other action as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, either party determines that the Form S-4 contains or is
informed by the other party that the information supplied by it for inclusion
in the Form S-4 contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the
statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made
not misleading, TCM and the Company shall promptly prepare and TCM shall file
an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 to correct the untrue statement or
omission and take all other appropriate action in respect thereof. Each party
will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the TCM Common Stock issuable

execution of this Agreement, to consider and vote upon the approval
and adoption of the Company Stockholder\'s Action. Subject to Section
5.03(c), the Company Special Committee and the Company Board shall recommend
the approval and adoption of the Company Stockholders\' Action by the
stockholders of the Company and shall include such recommendation in the
Company Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.03(c), the Company shall take
all lawful action to solicit from the stockholders of the Company proxies (in

of the Company Stockholders\' Action and to secure the vote of the
stockholders of the Company required by Georgia Law and the Company Articles
of Incorporation and Company By-Laws to approve and adopt the Company
Stockholders\' Action in accordance with the Company Stockholders\' Vote
Condition. As promptly as practicable after the Company Proxy
Statement contained in the Form S-4 has been cleared by the SEC, the Company
shall mail the proxy statement/prospectus/information statement contained in
the Form S-4 to the Company Stockholders as of the record date for the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting.   (d) Each party shall advise the other
parties hereto promptly of the happening of any event which makes untrue any
statement of a material fact contained in the Form S-4 or the Company Proxy
Statement, as applicable.   (e) The Company shall take all actions necessary
to comply with Article 13 of Georgia Law.   SECTION 5.03 Exclusivity;

5.03(c), enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or any other agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal;
provided, however, that the Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona

determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) the Company Special Committee

obligations undertaken in this Section 5.03. From the date hereof until the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and
the Effective Time, the Company shall notify TCM as promptly as practicable,
and in any event not later than the next business day, of any inquiries,

expressions of interest, requests, proposals or offers and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers, and thereafter shall keep TCM
informed, on a current basis, of any changes in the status and content of any
such proposals or offers. The Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries
and the officers, directors, employees and other agents of the Company and
its subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all

Company Special Committee determines in good faith (taking into account all
of the terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal, including any
conditions to consummation, break-up fees and expense reimbursement
provisions) to be more favorable and the value of which exceeds the value of
the Merger Consideration (it being agreed that the Merger Consideration shall
be deemed to include such number of shares of TCM Common Stock as it would
have included pursuant to this Agreement had the transactions consummated by
this Agreement been consummated on the date on which the Company Special
Committee evaluates such Takeover Proposal).    46     (c) From the
date hereof until the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII,

to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders
under applicable Law, (D) the Company Stockholders Action has not been
adopted and approved in satisfaction of the Company Stockholders\' Vote
Condition, (E) the Company Special Committee provides TCM with at least five
business days\' prior notice of its proposal to take any of the actions

Superior Proposal, and the Company shall and shall cause its legal advisors
to, negotiate with TCM with respect to the terms and conditions of any such
counterproposal, and (F) the Superior Proposal does not impose any "break-up"

options or rights to acquire assets or securities, or any other obligations
that would survive the Effective Time, on the Company or any subsidiary
unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with

Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made
by the Company or TCM or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the

U.S. federal or state securities Laws, (B) the rules and regulations of the

any other applicable Law. The Company and TCM shall cooperate with each other

Options.   (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Option, whether
vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any
further action of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, TCM or the holder
of any Option, be converted into a stock option to purchase TCM Common Stock
in a manner consistent with Section 424 of the Code and as provided by   
49    subsection (b) below, and, after the Effective Time, all references
to the Company in the Company Option Plan and the applicable stock option
agreements shall be deemed to refer to the Surviving Corporation, which shall
have retained the Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time by virtue of
this Agreement and the Merger and without any further action, except that
references to shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to be to TCM
Common Stock in accordance with subsection (b) below.   (b) Each Option so
retained by the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
Company Option Plan and the applicable stock option agreements as in effect

exercisable for that number of shares of TCM Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable
under such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the

of shares of TCM Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
TCM Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Option shall be equal
to the quotient of (x) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by (y) the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the next whole cent. It is the intention of the parties
that the Options remaining outstanding following the Effective Time will
qualify, to the maximum extent permissible following the Effective Time, as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code solely to the
extent such Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the
Effective Time.   (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, the Company will deliver to Option holders appropriate notices setting
forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the Company Option Plan and the
applicable stock option agreements evidencing the Options and confirming that
the Company Option Plan and the Options have been converted in accordance
with the terms and conditions required by this Section 5.06. TCM hereby
agrees to register the TCM Common Stock underlying such Options with the SEC
on Form S-8 within ten (10) business days subsequent to the Effective
Time.   SECTION 5.07 Notification of Certain Matters.   (a) The Company

Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect and (ii)
any failure of the Company to materially comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.07 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to TCM or Merger Sub.   (b) TCM shall give prompt notice to the
Company of (i) the occurrence, or non- occurrence, of any event the

with or satisfy any covenant,    50    condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the

otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Company.   SECTION

public statement without the prior written consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however,
that TCM or the Company may, without the prior written consent of the other
party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may upon the
advice of counsel be required by applicable Law or applicable regulation of

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for all persons who are directors
and officers of the Company on the date of this Agreement (or were prior to
the date of this Agreement), so long as the annual premium after the date of
this Agreement for such DandO; Insurance during such six-year period would not
exceed 300% of the annual premium as of the date of this Agreement. If,

services of such person at or prior to the Effective Time in the capacity of
such person as a director or officer of the Company (and such director or
officer promptly shall have given the Surviving Corporation written notice of
such claim or claims within such six-year period), the provisions of Sections
5.11(a) and (b) respecting the rights to indemnify the current or former
directors or officers under the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company
By-Laws shall continue in effect until the final disposition of all such
claims.   (d) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and representative and may not be amended, altered or repealed without
the prior written consent of the affected indemnified party.   SECTION 5.12
Certain Tax Matters.(a) Each of the parties hereto covenants and agrees to
report the Merger for United States federal and applicable state income tax
purposes in a manner consistent with the characterization of the Merger as a
tax-free reorganization under    52    Section 368 of the Code,

by Treasury Regulation section 1.368-3.   (b) Prior to the Closing (or at
such other times as requested by counsel), TCM, Merger Sub and the Company

this Agreement); or   (e) by either the Company Special Committee or the TCM
Special Committee, if the Merger has not been consummated by the 12-month
anniversary of the execution of this Agreement (provided that the failure to
consummate the Merger by such date was not the result of any act or failure
to act by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.01(e)); or   (f) by TCM, if the Company Board and the Company
Special Committee shall have failed to recommend or shall be withdrawn, or
modified or changed in a manner adverse to TCM its approval or recommendation

and the Company Special Committee authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with Section 5.03 of this Agreement, to enter into a binding

the Stockholder Vote Condition shall not have been satisfied by reason of
the failure to obtain the required vote at the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting;   (i) by either TCM or the Company, if the Separation and
Distribution Agreement is terminated; or    58     (j) by the Company,
if any material amendment or modification of the Separation and Distribution
Agreement to the disadvantage of TCM had been made or if the Separation and
Distribution Agreement is breached in any material respect.   SECTION 7.02
Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
7.01, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement will
terminate, except that the obligations in Section 5.09 will survive;
provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a party because of
the breach of this Agreement by the other party, or because one or more of
the conditions to the terminating party\'s obligations under this Agreement
is not satisfied as a result of the other party\'s failure to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, the terminating party\'s right to pursue
all legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired. Without limiting
the foregoing, if the Merger is not consummated and (x) if the Company shall
have breached any of its obligations under Section 5.03 hereof, the
actual Transaction Expenses of TCM and Merger Sub shall be paid by the
Company to TCM or (y) if TCM shall have breached any of its obligations under
Section 5.03 hereof, the actual Transaction Expenses of the Company shall be
paid by TCM to the Company.   ARTICLE VIII.  GENERAL PROVISIONS

or other acts, (b) waive any inaccuracies in its representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(c) waive compliance with any of its agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an

SECTION 8.04 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.    60     SECTION 8.05 Limited
Liability. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in the
absence of fraud, no stockholder, director, officer, affiliate, agent,
representative or counsel of the Company, TCM or Merger Sub, in its capacity
as such, shall have any liability in respect of or relating to the covenants,
obligations, representations or warranties of such party under this Agreement
or in respect of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto
and, to the fullest extent legally permissible, each of the Company, TCM and
Merger Sub, for itself and its stockholders, directors, officers
and affiliates, waives and agrees not to seek to assert or enforce any
such liability that any such person otherwise might have pursuant to
applicable law.   SECTION 8.06 Severability. If any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement nevertheless shall remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the TCM Special Committee and the Company Special Committee shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.  
SECTION 8.07 Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement (including
any exhibits and schedules hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the
TCM Disclosure Letter and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement may be amended prior to the Company Stockholders\' Action being
adopted only by an instrument in writing approved by the TCM Special
Committee and the Company Special Committee and signed by TCM, Merger Sub and
the Company stating that it constitutes an amendment to this Agreement,
except that the provisions of Section 5.11 shall not be amended except as
provided therein.   SECTION 8.08 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned
or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written approval of the TCM Special
Committee or the Company Special Committee, as applicable, and any such
assignment without such prior written approval shall be null and void, except
that TCM and/or Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TCM without consent of the Company;
provided that (1) TCM shall remain liable for all of its obligations under
this Agreement, including the obligation to issue shares of TCM Common Stock
as contemplated herein and (2) such assignment does not cause the Merger to
fail to be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code.   SECTION 8.09 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its
successors, and except as provided in Section 5.11, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon   
61    any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.   SECTION 8.10 Failure or
Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part
of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof
or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement
are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.   SECTION 8.11 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY, CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.   SECTION 8.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.   SECTION 8.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED
UPON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.   SECTION 8.14

to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in
the City of New York in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or

other request for leave from any such court.   SECTION 8.15 General
Interpretative Provisions; Definition of Knowledge.   (a) Terms for which
meanings are defined in this Agreement shall apply equally to the singular
and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine and feminine forms. Words

SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT   This Separation and Distribution
Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of August 2, 2005, by and
between Gray Television, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("Gray"), and Triple
Crown Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("TCM"). Capitalized terms used in
this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in Section 9.18.   RECITALS   A. Gray owns all of the
membership interests of Gray Publishing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Gray Publishing").   B. Gray through Gray Publishing operates six
regional publications comprising five daily newspapers and an advertising
shopper (the "Newspaper Publishing Business").   C. Gray Publishing owns
all of the membership interests of Graylink, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Graylink").   D. Graylink is a provider of wireless
services, primarily paging services, in non-major metropolitan areas in
Alabama, Florida, and Georgia and also owns and operates 14 retail locations
in Alabama, Florida and Georgia (the "Graylink Wireless Business").   E.
The Board of Directors of Gray has determined that it would be advisable and
in the best interests of Gray and its shareholders for Gray to transfer to
TCM all of the membership interests of Gray Publishing.   F. Gray has agreed
to convey, assign and transfer to TCM all of the membership interests of Gray
Publishing (collectively, the "Separation").   G. The Board of Directors of
Gray has determined that it would be advisable and in the best interests of
Gray and its shareholders for Gray to distribute on a pro-rata basis to the
holders of record of Gray Class A common stock, no par value ("Gray Class A
Common Stock"), and Gray common stock, no par value ("Gray Common Stock" and
with the Gray Class A Common Stock, the "Gray Stock"), without any
consideration being paid by such holders, all of the outstanding shares of
TCM common stock, par value $.001 per share (the "TCM Common Stock") owned by
Gray (the "Distribution"), and this Agreement has been approved by the Board
of Directors of Gray.   H. In reaching its decision to approve the
Separation and Distribution, the Board of Directors of Gray considered a
variety of factors including the following:   - as a result of the
Separation and Distribution, Gray and TCM will  be better able to focus
financial and operational resources on  its own business and executing its
own strategic plan;    1     - as a result of the Separation and
Distribution, Gray and TCM are  expected to have greater strategic and
financial flexibility to  support future growth opportunities;   - each
business is in a different stage of development and  therefore attracts
different types of investors;   - two separate public companies will enable
financial markets to  evaluate Gray and TCM more effectively, which is
expected to  maximize shareholder value over the long term for both Gray
and  TCM;   - the Separation and Distribution will allow Gray and TCM to 
develop incentive programs for management and other professionals  that are
tailored to its own business and are tied to the market  performance of its
own common stock;   - after the Separation and Distribution, Gray and TCM
should have  greater capital planning flexibility and the Newspaper
Publishing  Business and Graylink Wireless Business will no longer have to 
compete with Gray\'s television broadcasting business to secure  funding for
investments; and   - that TCM would possess sufficient scale and business
fundamentals  to operate as a stand-alone entity.   I. This Agreement and
the Separation and Distribution have been approved by the special committee
of the Board of Directors of TCM.   J. This Agreement and the Separation and
Distribution have been approved by the Board of Directors of TCM, consistent
with the approval and recommendation of the special committee of the Board of
Directors of TCM.   K. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Separation
and Distribution are intended to qualify as a divisive reorganization
described in Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.   L. The Board of
Directors has determined that conversion price relating to the Series C
preferred stock of Gray should be adjusted upon the consummation of the
Distribution.   M. The parties desire to set forth the principal
corporate transactions required to effect the Separation and the Distribution
and certain other agreements that will govern the relationship of Gray and
TCM following the Distribution.   AGREEMENT   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth below, the parties agree as follows:    2     SECTION 1

SECTION 3  THE DISTRIBUTION   3.1. Share Distribution.   (a) Delivery of
Shares for Distribution. Prior to the Distribution Date, Gray shall deliver
to TCM the certificate for 100 shares of TCM Common Stock held by Gray and
representing all of the outstanding TCM Common Stock, and TCM shall cancel
such certificate and issue and deliver to Gray in exchange therefor an
omnibus stock certificate    5    representing that number of shares of
TCM Common Stock equal to the total number of shares distributable pursuant
to Section 3.1(b). Gray shall then deliver such omnibus certificate to the
Distribution Agent.   (b) Distribution of Shares. Gray shall instruct the
Distribution Agent to distribute, beginning on the Distribution Date, to
holders of Gray Stock on the Record Date, the number of shares of TCM Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Gray Stock owned by such holder on the
Distribution Date, multiplied by 0.10, and as soon thereafter as reasonably
practicable, cash, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares of TCM Common
Stock obtained in the manner provided in Section 3.1(c) hereof. TCM agrees to
provide to the Distribution Agent sufficient certificates in such
denominations as the Distribution Agent may request in order to effect the
Distribution. All of the shares of TCM Common Stock issued in the
Distribution shall be fully paid, nonassessable, and free of preemptive
rights. Gray shareholders shall not be required to pay cash or other
consideration for the TCM Common Stock received in the Distribution.   (c)

TCM Common Stock shall be issued as part of the Distribution. In lieu of
receiving fractional shares, each holder of Gray Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fractional share of TCM Common Stock pursuant to the
Distribution will receive cash for such fractional share. Gray shall instruct
the Distribution Agent to determine the number of whole shares and fractional
shares of TCM Common Stock allocable to each holder of record or beneficial
owner of Gray Stock on the Distribution Date, to aggregate all such
fractional shares into whole shares, to sell the whole shares
obtained thereby in the open market at then prevailing prices on behalf of
holders of record or beneficial owners who otherwise would be entitled to
receive fractional shares of TCM Common Stock, and to distribute to each such
holder or for the benefit of each such beneficial owner such holder\'s or
owner\'s ratable share of the total proceeds (net of total selling expenses)
of such sale; provided, however, that the Distribution Agent shall have sole
discretion to determine when, how, through which broker-dealer, and at what
price to make its sales; provided, further, that the broker-dealer shall not
be an affiliate of Gray or TCM.   (d) Obligation to Provide Information.
Gray and TCM, as the case may be, will provide to the Distribution Agent all
share certificates and any information required in order to complete the
Distribution on the basis specified in Section 3.1.   3.2. Actions Prior to
the Distribution. On or before the Distribution Date, Gray and TCM shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to do and accomplish the following:

the Distribution Date, to the holders of Gray Common Stock, a
proxy statement/prospectus/information statement containing such
information concerning TCM, the Newspaper Publishing Business and Graylink
Wireless Business and the Separation and the Distribution and such other
matters as Gray and TCM shall reasonably determine are necessary and as may
be required by law. Gray and TCM shall prepare, and TCM shall file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on
Form S-4 to register the shares of TCM Common Stock to be issued in the
Distribution under the Securities    6    Act. Gray and TCM shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC and
to cause such registration statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such registration statement
is filed with the SEC. TCM shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form 8-A to register the shares of TCM Common Stock under the
Exchange Act.   (b) Blue Sky. Gray and TCM shall take and shall cause any
of their Subsidiaries to take all such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate under the securities or blue sky laws of any applicable states in
connection with the Distribution.   (c) Nasdaq National Market. TCM shall
prepare and file, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have
approved, an application for listing of the TCM Common Stock to be issued in
the Distribution on the Nasdaq National Market, subject to official notice of
issuance.   (d) Advisors. Gray and TCM shall participate in the

MATTERS   4.1. Employees. Immediately prior to, and subject to the
Separation, Gray shall transfer to TCM each employee of the Newspaper
Publishing Business and Graylink Wireless Business (the "Transferred
Employees") so that no such employee who becomes employed by TCM experiences
any termination or other interruption in employment and Gray shall cause all
such Transferred Employees to resign from all positions as officers or
employees of Gray and its Subsidiaries. Except as otherwise provided herein,
TCM shall be liable for all obligations relating to all Transferred Employees
for all periods, whether arising prior to, on or after the Separation Date.
All employees of Gray and its Subsidiaries as of the Separation Date who are
not Transferred Employees shall be retained by Gray and its Subsidiaries (the
"Retained Employees") and Gray shall be liable for all obligations relating
to all Retained Employees for all periods, whether arising prior to, on or
after the Separation Date. TCM and Gray (and their respective Subsidiaries)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish any transfers of
employment required by this Section 4.1 in a timely manner.    10    
4.2. Prior Service Credit. TCM shall give each Transferred Employee credit
for years of service with Gray or its Subsidiaries as if they were years of
service with TCM. TCM shall recognize such service for purposes of
satisfying any waiting period, evidence of insurability requirements or the
application of any preexisting condition limitation. TCM shall also give
Transferred Employees credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Gray plan
during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and
out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the benefit plan sponsored or maintained by
TCM.   4.3. 401(k) Plan. Immediately prior to, and subject to,
the Separation, Gray shall cause a "spin off" of the assets and liabilities
of the Gray Television, Inc. Capital Accumulation Plan (the "Gray 401(k)

identical, component plans and trusts, in accordance with applicable law
(including, without limitation, Section 414(l) of the Code), covering,
respectively, (i) the Transferred Employees (and their beneficiaries) (the
"TCM 401(k) Plan") and (ii) all other Gray 401(k) Plan participants (and
their beneficiaries). Immediately prior to, and subject to, the Separation,
Gray shall cause the TCM 401(k) Plan to be transferred to TCM but shall
retain the Gray 401(k) Plan. Prior to the Separation, Gray shall draft the
appropriate documents and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all
actions necessary, to the extent possible, to effectuate the intent of this
Section 4.3.   4.4. Pension Plan. Gray shall retain all liabilities and
obligations in respect of benefits accrued by Transferred Employees who
participate in the Gray Communications Systems, Inc. Retirement Plan (the
"Retirement Plan"). Benefit accruals in respect of Transferred Employees
shall cease as of the Separation Date and the Transferred Employees
participating therein shall be considered to have terminated employment for
purposes of such plan. Gray shall fully vest the accrued benefits of the
Transferred Employees under the Retirement Plan as of the Separation Date. No
assets under the Retirement Plan shall be transferred to TCM or to any plan
of TCM.   4.5. Welfare Plans   (a) Except as otherwise provided herein,
immediately prior to, and subject to, the Separation, Gray shall cause all of
Gray\'s employee welfare benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
(the "Gray Welfare Plans"), to be divided into separate, identical component
plans covering, respectively, (i) the Transferred Employees (and their
beneficiaries) (the "TCM Welfare Plans") and (ii) all other Gray Welfare Plan
participants (and their beneficiaries), including without limitation,
participants (and their beneficiaries) who experienced a "qualifying event"
for purposes of the group health plan continuation coverage requirements of
Section 4980 of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B of ERISA prior to the
Separation Date regardless of when an election for continuation coverage is
made by the participant. Immediately prior to and subject to, the Separation,
Gray shall cause the TCM Welfare Plans to be transferred to TCM but shall
retain the Gray Welfare Plans. Prior to the Separation, Gray shall draft the
appropriate documents and use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary, to the extent possible, to effectuate the intent of this Section
4.5(a).    11     (b) On and after the Separation Date, TCM shall pay,
or cause to be paid, all claims for health care benefits by the Transferred
Employees (and their beneficiaries), made after the Separation Date for post-
Separation periods, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all claims for health
care benefits by the Transferred Employees (and their beneficiaries), made
after the Separation for all periods prior to the Separation Date.   (c)
TCM shall be responsible for any liabilities or obligations for severance
obligations relating to employees of the Newspaper Publishing Business and
Graylink Wireless Business whose employment terminates prior to, or on or
after the Separation Date.   (d) Any Transferred Employee on short-term
disability as of the Closing Date that would have become eligible for long-
term disability benefits under the Gray Welfare Plans but for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
covered by the Gray Welfare Plan that provides long-term disability benefits
and TCM shall have no obligation to provide such coverage.   4.6. Section
125 Plan. Without limiting the generality of Section 4.5, immediately prior
to, and subject to, the Separation, Gray shall cause a "spin off" of the
assets and liabilities of the Gray Section 125 Plan (the "Gray Flex Plan")
(which contains premium, dependent care and medical health
reimbursement component parts) resulting in the division of the Gray Flex
Plan into two, separate, identical, component plans, in accordance with
applicable law, covering, respectively, (i) the Transferred Employees (and
their beneficiaries) (the "TCM Flex Plan") and (ii) all other Gray Flex Plan
participants (and their beneficiaries). Immediately prior to and subject to,
the Separation, Gray shall cause the TCM Flex Plan to be transferred to TCM
but shall retain the Gray Flex Plan. Prior to the Separation, Gray shall
draft the appropriate documents and use its reasonable best efforts to take
all actions necessary, to the extent possible, to effectuate the intent of
this Section 4.6.   4.7. Accrued Vacation. Gray and TCM agree that all
accrued vacation for Transferred Employees as of the Separation Date shall be
TCM\'s obligation.   4.8. Stock Option Plan. Immediately prior to, and
subject to, the Distribution, Gray shall cause each outstanding nonqualified
option to purchase shares of Gray Common Stock that was granted under the
Gray 2002 Long Term Incentive Plan on or before the Distribution Date to a
Transferred Employee to be become fully vested on the Distribution Date, and
to continue to be exercisable until the original expiration date. Prior to
the Separation, Gray shall prepare the appropriate documents and use its
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary, to the extent
possible, to effectuate the intent of this Section 4.8.   4.9. Workers\'
Compensation. TCM shall assume the liability for any workers\' compensation
or similar workers\' protection claims with respect to any employee of the
Newspaper Publishing Business and Graylink Wireless Business, whether
incurred prior to, on, or after the Distribution Date, which are the result
of an injury or illness originating prior to or on the Distribution
Date.    12     4.10. WARN Act. TCM and its Subsidiaries agree that
they shall not, at any time during the 90-day period following the
Distribution Date, (i) effectuate a "plant closing" as defined in the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the "WARN Act") affecting
any site of employment or operating units within any site of employment of
the Newspaper Publishing Business and Graylink Wireless Business, or (ii)
take any action to precipitate a "mass layoff" as defined in the WARN Act
affecting any site of employment of the Newspaper Publishing Business and
Graylink Wireless Business, except, in either case, after complying fully
with the notice and other requirements of the WARN Act. TCM agrees to
indemnify Gray and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and
directors and to defend and hold harmless Gray and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and directors from and against any and all
claims, losses, damages, expenses, obligations and liabilities (including
attorney\'s fees and other costs of defense) that Gray and its Subsidiaries
and their respective officers and directors may incur in connection with any
suit or claim of violation brought against Gray under the WARN Act, which
relates in whole or in part to actions taken by TCM or its Subsidiaries with
regard to any site of employment of TCM or operating units within any site of
employment of the Newspaper Publishing Business and Graylink Wireless
Business.   4.11. Information to be Provided. Each party and its
Subsidiaries shall provide any information that the other party may
reasonably request, including, but not limited to, information relating to
dates of termination of employment, in order to provide benefits to any
eligible employee of TCM or any of its Subsidiaries under the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or under the applicable Gray Plans.   4.12. No
Right to Employment. Nothing contained in this Agreement will confer upon any
Transferred Employees any rights or remedies, including, without limitation,
any right to employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, any employee benefit plan
or program for the Transferred Employees established by TCM may be amended
or terminated by TCM in accordance with its terms and applicable law.  
SECTION 5  INSURANCE MATTERS   5.1. Insurance Prior to the Distribution
Date. Gray shall not have any liability whatsoever to TCM as a result of the
insurance policies and practices of Gray in effect at any time at or prior to
the Distribution Date, including as a result of the level or scope of any
such insurance, the creditworthiness of any insurance carrier, the terms and
conditions of any policy, and the adequacy or timeliness of any notice to any
insurance carrier with respect to any claim or potential claim or
otherwise.   5.2. Ownership of Existing Policies and Programs. Gray or one
or more of its Subsidiaries shall continue to own all property, casualty and
liability insurance policies and programs, including, without limitation,
primary and excess general liability, errors and omissions, automobile,
workers\' compensation, property, fire, crime and surety insurance policies,
in effect on or before the Distribution Date (collectively, the "Gray
Policies" and individually, a "Gray Policy"). Gray shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the Gray Policies in full force and effect up
to and including the Distribution Date, and, subject to    13    the
provisions of this Agreement, Gray and its Subsidiaries shall retain all
of their respective rights, benefits and privileges, if any, under the
Gray Policies. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to be
an attempted assignment, or to change the ownership, of the Gray
Policies.   5.3. Naming of TCM as Additional Insured. To the extent not
already provided for by the terms of a Gray Policy, Gray shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause TCM to be named as an additional
insured under the Gray Policies whose effective policy periods include the
Distribution Date, in respect of claims arising out of or relating to periods
prior to the Distribution Date.   5.4. TCM Insurance Policies. Commencing
on and as of the Distribution Date, TCM shall be responsible for establishing
and maintaining separate property, casualty and liability insurance policies
and programs for activities and claims involving TCM or any of its
Subsidiaries. TCM will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to secure
liability insurance to avoid potential gaps in coverage. TCM and each of its
Subsidiaries, as appropriate, shall be responsible for all administrative and
financial matters relating to insurance policies established and maintained
by TCM and its Subsidiaries for claims relating to any period on or after the
Distribution Date involving TCM or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
any other agreement or understanding to the contrary, except as set forth in
Section 5.6 with respect to claims administration and financial
administration of the Gray Policies, neither Gray nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall have any responsibility for or obligation to TCM or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to property and casualty insurance matters for any
period, whether prior to, on, or after the Distribution Date.   5.5. TCM
Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. Gray shall cause to be maintained for a
period of six years from the Distribution Date, Gray\'s current directors\'
and officers\' insurance and indemnification policies and fiduciary liability
policies ("DandO; Insurance"), provided that, Gray may substitute therefor, at
is election, policies or financial guarantees with the same carriers or other
reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous that
the existing DandO; Insurance, to the extent that such insurance policies
provide coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Distribution Date
for all persons who are directors and officers of TCM on the date of
this Agreement (or were such prior to the date of this Agreement), so long as
the annual premium after the date of this Agreement for such DandO; Insurance
during such six-year period would not exceed 300% of the annual premium as of
the date of this Agreement. If, during such six-year period, such insurance
coverage can only be obtained for an amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premium therefor as of the date of this Agreement, Gray shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause insurance coverage at a reduced face
amount to be obtained for an amount equal to 300% of the current annual
premium therefore, on terms and conditions substantially similar to the
existing DandO; Insurance. Set forth in Schedule 5.5 is the amount of the
annual premium currently paid by Gray for its DandO; Insurance. In the event
Gray or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Gray assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.5. The provisions of this    14    Section 5.5 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each officer
and director of TCM on the date of this Agreement (or prior to the date of
this Agreement) and his or her heirs and representatives.   5.6. Post-
Distribution Insurance Claims Administration. Upon notification by TCM or one
of its Subsidiaries of a claim relating to TCM or one of its Subsidiaries
under one or more of the Gray Policies, Gray shall cooperate with TCM in
asserting and pursuing coverage and payment for such claim by the appropriate
insurance carrier(s). In asserting and pursuing such coverage and payment,
Gray and TCM shall jointly make all decisions, determinations, commitments
and stipulations concerning any such claims on its own behalf and on behalf
of TCM and its Subsidiaries, which decisions, determinations, commitments and
stipulations shall be final and conclusive if reasonably made to maximize the
overall economic benefit of the Gray Policies. TCM and its Subsidiaries shall
assume responsibility for, and shall pay to the appropriate
insurance carriers or otherwise, any premiums, defense costs, indemnity
payments, deductibles, retentions or other charges (collectively, "Insurance
Charges") whenever arising, which shall become due and payable under the
terms and conditions of any applicable Gray Policy in respect of any claims
made by TCM or one of its Subsidiaries under the Gray Policies, whether the
same relate to the period prior to, on, or after the Distribution Date. To
the extent that the terms of any applicable Gray Policy provide that Gray or
any of its Subsidiaries shall have an obligation to pay or guarantee the
payment of any Insurance Charges relating to TCM or any of its Subsidiaries,
Gray shall be entitled to demand that TCM make such payment directly to the
Person or entity entitled thereto. In connection with any such demand, Gray
shall submit to TCM a copy of any invoice received by Gray pertaining to such
Insurance Charges together with appropriate supporting documentation, to the
extent available. In the event that TCM fails to pay any such Insurance
Charges when due and payable, whether at the request of the Person entitled
to payment or upon demand by Gray, Gray and its Subsidiaries may (but shall
not be required to) pay such Insurance Charges for and on behalf of TCM and,
thereafter, TCM shall forthwith reimburse Gray for such payment. Subject to
the other provisions of this Section 5, the retention by Gray of the Gray
Policies and the responsibility for claims administration and financial
administration of such policies are in no way intended to limit, inhibit or
preclude any right of TCM, Gray or any other insured to insurance coverage
for any insured claims under the Gray Policies.   5.7. Non-Waiver of Rights
to Coverage. An insurance carrier that would otherwise be obligated to pay
any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto,
or, solely by virtue of the provisions of this Section 5, have any
subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and
agreed that no insurance carrier nor any third party shall be entitled to a
benefit that they would not be entitled to receive had no Distribution
occurred or in the absence of the provisions of this Section 5.   5.8. Scope
of Affected Policies of Insurance. The provisions of this Section 5 relate
solely to matters involving liability, casualty and workers\' compensation
insurance and shall not be construed to affect any obligation of or impose
any obligation on the parties with respect to any life, health and accident,
dental or medical insurance policies applicable to any of the officers,
directors, employees or other representatives of the parties or
their Subsidiaries.    15     SECTION 6  CERTAIN COVENANTS   6.1.
Further Instruments; Consents.   (a) In addition to the specific agreements,
documents, and instruments attached to this Agreement, Gray and TCM shall
execute or cause to be executed by the appropriate parties and deliver, as
appropriate, such other agreements, instruments and documents as may be
necessary or desirable in order to effect the purposes of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements. Neither Gray nor TCM shall be obligated, in
connection with the foregoing, to expend money other than reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses, attorneys\' fees, and recording or similar fees.
Furthermore, each party, at the request of the other party hereto, shall do
and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for
effecting completely the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (b) Gray shall use reasonable efforts (but Gray shall not
be required to make any payment), to obtain at the earliest practicable date
all consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.3(e)(ii). If, with
respect to any Assigned Contract or any agreement, lease or commitment of
Gray Publishing and its Subsidiaries, a required consent to the transfer of
the membership interests of Gray Publishing is not obtained (and,
accordingly, pursuant to section 1.2(d), the agreement, lease or commitment
is excluded from the contribution to TCM), Gray shall use reasonable efforts
(but Gray shall not be required to make any payment), to keep it in effect
and give TCM the benefit of it to the same extent as if it had been assigned,
without any additional cost to TCM in excess of the amount for which it would
have been responsible had such contract been assigned. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as an attempt to assign any agreement or other
instrument that is by its terms nonassignable without the consent of the
other party.   6.2. Exchange of Information.   (a) General. Each of Gray
and TCM, for itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, agrees to provide, or
cause to be provided, to the other, at any time before or after the
Distribution Date, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request
therefor, any Information in the possession or under the control of such
party that the requesting party reasonably needs (i) to comply with
reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the requesting
party (including under applicable securities laws) by any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the requesting party, (ii) for use in any
other judicial, regulatory, administrative or other proceeding or in order to
satisfy audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or other similar
requirements, (iii) to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement or (iv) in connection with the ongoing businesses
of Gray or TCM, as the case may be; provided, however, that in the event that
any party determines that any such provision of Information could be
commercially detrimental, violate any law or agreement, or waive any
attorney-client privilege, the parties shall take all reasonable measures to
permit the compliance with such obligations in a manner that avoids any such
harm or consequence.    16     (b) Internal Accounting Controls;
Financial Information. After the Separation Date, (i) each party shall
maintain in effect at its own cost and expense adequate systems and controls
for its business to the extent necessary to enable the other party to satisfy
its reporting, accounting, audit and other obligations, and (ii) each party
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the other party and its
Subsidiaries in such form as such requesting party shall request, at no
charge to the requesting party, all financial and other data and Information
as the requesting party determines necessary or advisable in order to prepare
its financial statements and reports or filings with any
Governmental Authority.   (c) Ownership of Information. Any Information
owned by a party that is provided to a requesting party pursuant to this
Section 6.2 shall be deemed to remain the property of the providing party.
Unless specifically set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring rights of license or
otherwise in any such Information.   (d) Record Retention. To facilitate
the possible exchange of Information pursuant to this Section 6.2 and other
provisions of this Agreement after the Distribution Date, the parties agree
to use commercially reasonable efforts to retain all Information in their
respective possession or control on the Distribution Date in accordance with
the policies of Gray as in effect on the Distribution Date or such other
policies as may be reasonably adopted by the applicable party after the
Distribution Date. No party will destroy, or permit any of its affiliates to
destroy, any Information which the other party may have the right to obtain
pursuant to this Agreement prior to the third anniversary of the date of this
Agreement without first using its commercially reasonable efforts to notify
the other party of the proposed destruction and giving the other party the
opportunity to take possession of such Information prior to such destruction;
provided, however, that in the case of any Information relating to taxes,
employee benefits or environmental liabilities, such period shall be extended
to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (giving effect to
any extensions thereof); provided further, however, that in the event that
any such Information is also subject to a retention requirement contained in
any Ancillary Agreement that is longer than the requirement set forth in
this Section 6.2, then the requirement in such Ancillary Agreement shall
control.   (e) Limitation of Liability. No party shall have any liability
to any other party in the event that any Information exchanged or provided
pursuant to this Section 6.2 is found to be inaccurate, in the absence of
willful misconduct by the party providing such Information. No party shall
have any liability to any other party if any Information is destroyed or lost
after commercially reasonable efforts by such party to comply with the
provisions of Section 6.2(d).   (f) Other Agreements Providing for Exchange
of Information. The rights and obligations granted under this Section 6.2 are
subject to any specific limitations, qualifications, or additional provisions
on the sharing, exchange, or confidential treatment of Information set forth
in this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement.   (g) Production of
Witnesses; Records; Cooperation. After the Distribution Date, except in the
case of a legal or other proceeding by one party against another party (which
shall be governed by such discovery rules as may be applicable under Section
8 or    17    otherwise), each party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make available to the other party, upon written
request, the former, current, and future directors, officers, employees,
other personnel, and agents of such party as witnesses and any books,
records, or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the
ability to make available, to the extent that any such person (giving
consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees,
other personnel, and agents) or books, records, or other documents may
reasonably be required in connection with any legal, administrative, or other
proceeding in which the requesting party may from time to time be involved,
regardless of whether such legal, administrative, or other proceeding is a
matter with respect to which indemnification may be sought. The requesting
party shall bear all costs and expenses in connection therewith.   6.3.
Privileged Matters.   (a) Preservation of Privileges. The parties each agree
that they will maintain, preserve, and assert all privileges, including,
without limitation, privileges arising under or relating to the attorney-
client relationship (which shall include, without limitation, the attorney-
client and work product privileges), that relate directly or indirectly to
such party for any period prior to the Distribution Date ("Privilege" or
"Privileges"). Neither party shall waive any Privilege that could be asserted
under applicable law without the prior written consent of the other party.
The rights and obligations created by this Section 6.3 shall apply to all
Information as to which, but for the Distribution, a party would have been
entitled to assert or did assert the protection of a Privilege ("Privileged
Information"), including, but not limited to, (i) any and all Information
generated prior to the Distribution Date but which, after the Distribution,
is in the possession of the other party; (ii) all communications subject to a
Privilege occurring prior to the Distribution Date between counsel for such
party and any person who, at the time of the communication, was an employee
of such party, regardless of whether such employee is or becomes an employee
of the other party; and (iii) all Information generated, received, or arising
after the Distribution Date that refers or relates to Privileged Information
generated, received, or arising prior to the Distribution Date.   (b)
Notices. Upon receipt by a party or any of its Subsidiaries of any subpoena,
discovery, or other request that arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of Privileged Information or if such party or any of its
Subsidiaries obtains knowledge that any current or former employee of
such party or any of its Subsidiaries has received any subpoena, discovery,
or other request that arguably calls for the production or disclosure of
Privileged Information, such party shall promptly notify the other party of
the existence of the request and shall provide the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review the Information and to assert any rights it may have
under this Section 6.3 or otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure
of Privileged Information. Neither party will produce or disclose any
Information arguably covered by a Privilege under this Section 6.3 unless (i)
the other party has provided its express written consent to such production
or disclosure, or (ii) unless compelled to disclose by judicial or
administrative process or, in the opinion of its independent legal counsel,
by other requirements of law.   (c) Access Not a Waiver. The access to
Information being granted pursuant to Section    18    6.2, the
agreement to provide witnesses and individuals pursuant to Section 6.2, and
the transfer of Privileged Information pursuant to this Agreement shall
not be deemed a waiver of any Privilege that has been or may be asserted
under this Section 6.3 or otherwise.   6.4. Certain Business Matters. No
party shall have any duty to refrain from (i) engaging in the same or similar
activities or lines of business as the other party, (ii) doing business with
any potential or actual supplier or customer of the other party or (iii)
engaging in, or refraining from, any other activities whatsoever relating to
any potential or actual suppliers or customers of the other party.   6.5.
Payment Obligations. On the Separation Date, TCM shall pay, or shall cause
Gray Publishing to pay, the balance due as of the Separation Date under that
certain promissory note dated as of December 31, 2004, by and between Gray
Publishing and Gray Television Group, Inc. (the "Promissory Note") to
Gray Television Group, Inc., which payment shall be in complete satisfaction
of Gray Publishing\'s obligations under the Promissory Note. In addition, on
the Separation Date, in partial consideration of the transfer of the
membership interests and other assets to TCM under Section 1.1, TCM shall
distribute to Gray an amount equal to the difference between (i) $40.0
million and (ii) the amount paid to Gray Television Group, Inc. pursuant to
the Promissory Note.   6.6. Reimbursement Obligations. Following the
Distribution, TCM shall promptly reimburse Gray for any amounts paid, from
time to time, by Gray pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee and
Acknowledgment dated June 9, 2005 made by Gray and the special committee of
the Board of Directors of Gray in favor of Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin
Capital, Inc. and its affiliates.   SECTION 7  INDEMNIFICATION   7.1.
Indemnification by Gray. Gray shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TCM
and its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, counsel, and agents (the "TCM Indemnitees") from and against any
and all Indemnifiable Losses incurred or suffered by any TCM Indemnitee in
connection with any Action or threatened Action and arising out of or due to,
directly or indirectly, (i) any of the Retained Assets, (ii) any of the
Assumed Liabilities or (iii) any failure to perform, or violation of,
any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that is to be
performed or complied with by Gray or its Subsidiaries (other than TCM and
its Subsidiaries).   7.2. Indemnification by TCM. TCM shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless Gray and its Subsidiaries, and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, counsel, and agents (the "Gray
Indemnitees") from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses incurred or
suffered by any Gray Indemnitee in connection with any Action or threatened
Action and arising out of or due to, directly or indirectly, (i) the
Newspaper Publishing Business, (ii) Graylink Wireless Business, (iii) the
Assigned Contracts, (iv) the Assigned Real Property, or (v) any failure to
perform, or violation of, any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement that is to be performed or complied with by TCM or its
Subsidiaries.   7.3. Procedure for Indemnification.    19     (a)
General. The following procedures shall apply to any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 and pursuant
to any indemnities provided in any Ancillary Agreement.   (b) Notices. If a
Gray Indemnitee or TCM Indemnitee shall receive notice of any Action by any
third party, or any fact or allegation upon which such Action could be based
(hereinafter a "Third Party Claim"), with respect to which an Indemnifying
Party is or may be obligated to make an Indemnity Payment, it shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof (including any pleadings relating
thereto), specifying in reasonable detail the nature of such Third Party
Claim and the amount or estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Indemnity
Payment); provided, however, that the failure of an Indemnitee to give notice
as provided in this Section 7.3 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations under this Section 7, except to the
extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to
give notice.   (c) Defense. For any Third Party Claim upon which notice
is required to be given under Section 7.3(b), the Indemnifying Party shall
defend such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense and through
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee. Within 30 days of receipt of the notice of the Third Party Claim
received under Section 7.3(b), the Indemnifying Party shall give notice of
its intent to defend or objection to the claim of indemnification specifying
in reasonable detail the grounds therefor. Failure to provide such notice
within such 30-day period shall be deemed an acknowledgment by the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnity obligation for the Third Party Claim.  
(d) Settlement. The Indemnifying Party\'s right to defend any Third Party
Claim includes the right to control, manage, and direct the defense of the
Third Party Claim and to compromise, settle, or consent to the entry of any
judgment or determination of liability concerning such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise,
settle, or consent to the entry of judgment or determination of liability
against the Indemnitee without prior written approval by the Indemnitee,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that if the Indemnifying Party shall seek the approval of the
Indemnitee to a settlement for monetary damages for which the Indemnifying
Party accepts responsibility and if the Indemnitee shall withhold or
unreasonably delay approval of such settlement, then the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party shall be limited to the amount of the proposed and
unapproved settlement, plus attorney\'s fees and costs to the date of the
proposed settlement, and the Indemnitee shall be solely responsible for any
additional amount.   (e) Participation. The Indemnitee may participate in
the Indemnifying Party\'s defense of any Third Party Claim in which the
Indemnitee has an interest and be represented by counsel of its own choosing
at the Indemnitee\'s sole cost and expense.   (f) Failure to Defend. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to defend a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may
defend and may compromise and settle or consent to an entry of judgment or a
determination of liability concerning such Third Party Claim at the
sole    20    cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnitee shall not compromise, settle, or consent to the
entry of judgment or determination of liability against the Indemnitee
without prior written approval by the Indemnifying Party, unless such
approval is unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (g) Access to Information.
Regardless of the party that defends a Third Party Claim, the other shall
make available to the Indemnifying Party all employees, Information, books
and records, communications, and documents, within its possession or control,
that are necessary, appropriate or reasonably deemed relevant with respect to
such defense, and otherwise shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim.   (h) Release of Liability. With respect to any Third
Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party or Indemnitee shall enter into any
compromise, settlement, or consent to the entry of any judgment that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the third party of a
release of the Indemnitee from all further liability concerning such Third
Party Claim.   (i) Payment. Upon final judgment after exhaustion of all
appeals, settlement, compromise, or other final resolution of any Third Party
Claim, and unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay promptly on behalf of the Indemnitee, or to the
Indemnitee in reimbursement of any amount theretofore required to be paid by
it, the amount so determined by final judgment after exhaustion of all
appeals, settlement, compromise, or final resolution. Upon the payment in
full by the Indemnifying Party of such amount, the Indemnifying Party shall
succeed to the rights of such Indemnitee, to the extent not waived in
settlement, against any third party.   7.4. Direct Claims. Any claim for
indemnity pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 on account of an
Indemnifiable Loss made directly by the Indemnitee against the Indemnifying
Party that does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by
written notice from the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Such
Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 90 days (or such shorter time
period as may be required by law as indicated by the Indemnitee in
the written notice) within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying
Party does not respond within such 90-day (or lesser) period, such
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted responsibility to make
payment and shall have no further right to contest the validity of such
claim. If such Indemnifying Party does respond within such 90-day (or lesser)
period and rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be
free to pursue resolution as provided in Section 8.   7.5. Adjustment of
Indemnifiable Losses. The amount that an Indemnifying Party is required to
pay to an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 shall be reduced
(including, without limitation, retroactively) by any insurance proceeds and
other amounts actually recovered by such Indemnitee in reduction of the
related Indemnifiable Loss. If an Indemnitee shall have received an Indemnity
Payment in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss and shall subsequently actually
receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Indemnifiable
Loss, then such Indemnitee shall pay to such Indemnifying Party a sum equal
to the lesser of the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually received or the net amount of Indemnity Payments actually received
previously.    21     7.6. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except to the
extent expressly provided otherwise in this Section 7, the indemnification
provided for by this Section 7 shall not inure to the benefit of any third
party or parties and shall not relieve any insurer or other third party that
would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim of the responsibility with
respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions
hereof, provide any subrogation rights with respect thereto, and each party
agrees to waive such rights against the other to the fullest extent
permitted.   SECTION 8  DISPUTE RESOLUTION   8.1. General. The resolution
of any and all disputes arising from or in connection with this Agreement,
whether based on contract, tort or otherwise (collectively, "Disputes"),
shall be exclusively governed by and settled in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 8.   8.2. Negotiation. The parties shall make a
good faith attempt to resolve any Dispute through negotiation. Within 30 days
after notice of a Dispute is given by either party to the other party, each
party shall select a negotiating team comprised of two or more vice
president-level employees of such party and shall meet within 30 days after
the end of the first 30-day negotiating period to attempt to resolve the
matter. During the course of negotiations under this Section 8.2, all
reasonable requests made by one party to the other for Information, including
requests for copies of relevant documents, will be honored. The specific
format for such negotiations will be left to the discretion of the designated
negotiating teams but may include the preparation of agreed-upon statements
of fact or written statements of position furnished to the other party.  
8.3. Non-Binding Mediation. In the event that any Dispute is not settled by
the parties within 30 days after the first meeting of the negotiating teams
under Section 8.2, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve
such Dispute by non-binding mediation in accordance with the American
Arbitration Association Commercial Mediation Rules. The mediation shall be
held within 60 days of the end of such 30-day negotiation period of the
negotiating teams. Except as provided below in Section 8.4, no litigation for
the resolution of such dispute may be commenced until the parties attempt in
good faith to settle the dispute by such mediation in accordance with such
rules and either party has concluded in good faith that amicable resolution
through continued mediation of the matter does not appear likely. The costs
of mediation shall be shared equally by the parties to the mediation. Any
settlement reached by mediation shall be recorded in writing, signed by the
parties, and shall be binding on them.   8.4. Proceedings. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prohibit either party from initiating litigation or other
judicial or administrative proceedings if such party would be substantially
harmed by a failure to act during the time that such good faith efforts are
being made to resolve the Dispute through negotiation or mediation. In the
event that litigation is commenced under this Section 8.4, the parties agree
to continue to attempt to resolve any Dispute according to the terms of
Section 8.2 and Section 8.3 during the course of such litigation proceedings
under this Section 8.4.    22     8.5. Pay and Dispute. Except as
provided in this Agreement, in the event of any dispute regarding payment of
a third-party invoice (subject to standard verification of receipt of
products or services), the party named in a third party\'s invoice must make
timely payment to such third party, even if the party named in the invoice
desires to pursue the dispute resolution procedures outlined in this Section
8. If the party that paid the invoice is found pursuant to this Section 8 to
not be responsible for such payment, such paying party shall be entitled to
reimbursement, with interest accrued at a compound annual rate of the Prime
Rate, from the party found responsible for such payment.   SECTION 9

substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to either party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being

indemnify and hold harmless TCM and any member of the TCM Group from and
against, on a net after Tax basis, any Restructuring Taxes and any reasonable
expenses (including, but not limited to, attorney\'s fees) incurred
in defending any audit or examination with respect to Restructuring
Taxes.   (b) INDEMNIFICATION FOR TCM TAINTING ACTS. TCM covenants that
neither TCM nor any member of the TCM Group shall commit or be party to or
the subject of any TCM Tainting Act. To the extent that any member of the
Gray Group would not have been liable for the following amounts but for a TCM
Tainting Act, TCM shall pay, and shall    -5-    indemnify and hold
harmless the Gray Group from and against, on a net after Tax basis, any
liability of any member of the Gray Group attributable to Taxes imposed upon
any member of the Gray Group or any other Person (together with
any reasonable expenses (including, but not limited to, attorney\'s fees)
incurred in defending against any such liability) resulting from a Final
Determination that (i) the Reorganization failed to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, (ii) the Distribution
failed to qualify as a transaction described in Section 355 of the Code or
(iii) the stock of TCM distributed to Gray\'s shareholders failed to
constitute "qualified property" within the meaning of Sections 355(c)(2) and
361(c)(2) of the Code, including by reason of the application of Section
355(e) of the Code.   (c) INDEMNIFICATION FOR GRAY TAINTING ACTS. Gray
covenants that neither Gray nor any member of the Gray Group shall commit or
be party to or the subject of any Gray Tainting Act. To the extent that any
member of the TCM Group would not have been liable for the following amounts
but for a Gray Tainting Act, Gray shall pay, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the TCM Group from and against, on a net after Tax basis, any
liability of any member of the Gray Group or the TCM Group attributable to
Taxes imposed upon any member of the Gray Group, any member of the TCM Group,
or any other Person (together with any reasonable expenses (including, but
not limited to, attorney\'s fees) incurred in defending against any such
liability) resulting from a Final Determination that (i) the Reorganization
failed to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code,
(ii) the Distribution failed to qualify as a transaction described in Section
355 of the Code or (iii) the stock of TCM distributed to Gray\'s shareholders
failed to constitute "qualified property" within the meaning of Sections
355(c)(2) and 361(c)(2) of the Code, including by reason of the application
of Section 355(e) of the Code.   2.05 PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE DISTRIBUTION
DATE.   (a) To the extent permitted by law or administrative practice,
the taxable year of each member of the TCM Group shall be treated as closing
at the close of the Distribution Date.   (b) If it is necessary for
purposes of this Agreement to determine the Tax liability of any member of
the TCM Group for a taxable year or period that begins on or before and ends
after the Distribution Date and is not treated under Section 2.05(a) as
closing at the close of the Distribution Date, the determination shall be
made, in the case of Taxes that are based upon income or receipts, by
assuming that the relevant taxable period ended at the close of
the Distribution Date, except that any exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a time basis.
In the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis, are payable for a
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Distribution Date, and
are not based upon or related to income or receipts, the portion of such Tax
that relates to the Pre-Distribution Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Distribution Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire taxable period.    -6-     ARTICLE III.  
CARRYBACKS  Without the consent of Gray, which shall not be withheld or
delayed unreasonably, no member of the TCM Group shall carry back any net
operating loss or other Tax attribute (unless required to carry back such
loss or Tax attribute by law) from a Post-Distribution Period to a Pre-
Distribution Period. Provided that Gray consents to the carryback or if the
carryback is required by law, Gray (or any other member of the Gray Group
receiving such refund) shall promptly remit to TCM any refunds it receives
with respect to any such carryback. Any refund of Taxes resulting from any
such carryback by a member of the TCM Group shall be payable to TCM. For
purposes of this Article III, it shall be deemed reasonable for Gray to
withhold its consent to any carryback, or alternatively to require reasonable
monetary compensation for granting such consent, to the extent that Gray
determines in good faith that such carryback will cause (i) an actual
increase in the Taxes for which the Gray Group is responsible, or (ii)
an actual reduction in the amount of any refund of Taxes payable to the Gray
Group or in the amount of any Tax attribute of the Gray Group.   ARTICLE
IV.   PAYMENTS   4.01 PAYMENTS. Payments due under this Agreement shall be
made no later than thirty (30) days after the receipt or crediting of a
refund, the delivery of notice of payment of a Tax for which the other party
is responsible under this Agreement, or the delivery of notice of a Final
Determination which results in such other party becoming obligated to make a
payment hereunder to the other party hereto. Payments due hereunder, but not
made within such 30-day period, shall be accompanied with interest at a rate
equal to the Applicable Federal Rate from the due date of such payment.  
4.02 NOTICE. Gray and TCM shall give each other prompt written notice of any
payment that may be due to the provider of such notice under this
Agreement.   ARTICLE V.   TAX AUDITS   5.01 GENERAL. Except as provided
in Section 5.02, each of TCM and Gray shall have sole responsibility for all
audits or other proceedings ("Tax Controversies") with respect to Tax Returns
that it is required to file under Section 2.01 (the "Controlling Party").
Except as provided in Section 5.02(c) or Section 5.02(d), the Controlling
Party shall have the sole right to contest the audit or proceeding and to
employ advisors of its choice.   5.02 INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS.   (a) Gray or
TCM shall promptly notify the other in writing as soon as practicable after
receipt by such party of any written communication from a relevant Taxing
Authority that proposes adjustment to a Tax Return that may result in
liability of the other party    -7-    (the "Indemnitor") under this
Agreement (a "Proposed Tax Adjustment"). If the Indemnitor is not also the
Controlling Party, the Controlling Party shall provide the Indemnitor with
information about the nature and amounts of the Proposed Tax Adjustments.  
(b) The Indemnitor shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice from the
Controlling Party within which to object to the Proposed Tax Adjustment. If
the Indemnitor does not notify the Controlling Party within such 30 day
period that it objects to the Proposed Tax Adjustment, Section 5.02(c) and
Section 5.02(d) below shall not apply, and the Controlling Party shall
have exclusive control over all stages of the Tax Controversy, including
full authority to determine whether and in what manner to contest or
compromise the Proposed Tax Adjustment.   (c) If the Indemnitor notifies
the Controlling Party that it objects to a Proposed Tax Adjustment, then the
Controlling Party shall not thereafter consent to the adjustment or
compromise of such Proposed Tax Adjustment without the consent of the
Indemnitor, but shall cooperate with the Indemnitor to resolve the Proposed
Tax Adjustment on a reasonable basis acceptable to the Indemnitor. Prior to
the issuance of any notice raising a Proposed Tax Adjustment or similar stage
in the proceedings, however, the Controlling Party shall be responsible for
the conduct of the audit, including matters pertaining to such Proposed Tax
Adjustment. The Controlling Party shall notify the Indemnitor in advance of
any conferences, meetings, and proceedings pertaining to the audit and, at
its own expense, the Indemnitor shall have the right to attend all such
proceedings with any Taxing Authority, the subject matter of which is or
includes such Proposed Tax Adjustment.   (i) Upon the issuance of a notice
of proposed adjustment or similar stage in the proceedings, the Indemnitor
shall assume the conduct of all further proceedings, with counsel selected by
it, at the Indemnitor\'s sole expense, insofar as the proceedings relate to a
Proposed Tax Adjustment, and thereafter the Indemnitor and the Controlling
Party shall jointly be responsible for the conduct of proceedings to contest
such Proposed Tax Adjustment.   (ii) In the event that the Controlling Party
receives a notice of deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service, or a
similar notice from any other Taxing Authority, and such notice includes one
or more Proposed Tax Adjustments, then:   (A) upon receiving a written
request from the Indemnitor,  given no later than a date reasonably necessary
to permit preparation and  timely filing of a petition in the United States
Tax Court for  redetermination of the deficiency relating to the Proposed Tax
Adjustment,  or a court of similar jurisdiction with respect to a Proposed
Tax  Adjustment imposed by any other Taxing Authority, the Controlling
Party  shall timely file such petition (at the Indemnitor\'s sole expense);
or   (B) If (1) the Indemnitor does not request the Controlling  Party to
file a petition for redetermination of the deficiency pursuant to  subsection
5.02(c)(ii)(A) hereof, (2) the Indemnitor requests that the  Controlling
Party file a claim for refund of Taxes relating to a Proposed  Tax
Adjustment, and (3) the Indemnitor provides the Controlling Party with 
sufficient funds to pay the deficiency relating to the Proposed Tax 
Adjustment, then the Controlling Party (at the Indemnitor\'s sole
expense)    -8-     shall file a claim for refund thereof and, if the
claim is denied, bring an  action in a court of competent jurisdiction
seeking such refund.   (C) In the event that a judgment of the United States
Tax  Court or other court of competent jurisdiction results in an adverse 
determination with respect to the Proposed Tax Adjustment, then the 
Indemnitor shall have the right to cause the Controlling Party to appeal 
from such adverse determination at the Indemnitor\'s sole expense.   (D) The
Indemnitor and its representatives, at the  Indemnitor\'s sole expense, shall
be entitled to the extent permitted by law  to participate in (1) all
conferences, meetings, or proceedings with any  Taxing Authority, the subject
matter of which is a Proposed Tax Adjustment,  and (2) all appearances before
any court, the subject matter of which is a  Proposed Tax Adjustment. The
right to participate referred to in this  subsection 5.02(c)(ii)(D) hereof
shall include matters such as the  submission and content of documentation,
memoranda of fact and law and  briefs, the conduct of oral arguments or
presentations, the selection of  witnesses, and the negotiation of
stipulations of fact with respect to a  Proposed Tax Adjustment.   (d) If a
notice of proposed adjustment raises both one or more issues that would
result in Taxes for which the Controlling Party is liable under
this Agreement in addition to one or more issues that constitute Proposed
Tax Adjustments for which any other party is liable under this Agreement,
then the Controlling Party and the Indemnitor shall cooperate with each other
to allow each party to conduct the Tax Controversy with respect to those
issues that would result in Taxes for which such party is liable under this

Controversy with respect to the issues that would result in Taxes for which
such party is liable under this Agreement.   ARTICLE VI.  
COOPERATION  Gray and TCM shall cooperate with each other in the filing of
any Tax Returns and the conduct of any audit or other proceeding and each
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and make available such
other documents as are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this
Agreement. Each party agrees to notify the other party in writing of any
audit adjustments which do not result in Tax liability but can be reasonably
expected to affect Tax Returns of the other party, or any of its
Subsidiaries, for a Post-Distribution Period. Unless and until there has been
a Final Determination to the contrary, each party agrees to treat the
Reorganization as a reorganization qualifying under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of
the Code and the Distribution as a transaction qualifying under Section 355
of the Code.    -9-     ARTICLE VII.   RETENTION OF RECORDS;
ACCESS  The Gray Group and the TCM Group shall (a) in accordance with their
then current record retention policy, retain records, documents, accounting
data and other information (including computer data) necessary for the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns in respect of Taxes of the Gray
Group or the TCM Group for any Pre-Distribution Period or for the audit of
such Tax Returns; and (b) give to the other reasonable access to such
records, documents, accounting data and other information (including computer
data) and to its personnel (insuring their cooperation) and premises, for the
purpose of the review or audit of such Tax Returns to the extent relevant to
an obligation or liability of a party under this Agreement. At any time after
the Distribution Date that the TCM Group proposes to destroy such material or
information, they shall first notify the Gray Group in writing and the Gray
Group shall be entitled to receive such materials or information proposed to
be destroyed. At any time after the Distribution Date that the Gray Group
proposes to destroy such material or information, they shall first notify the
TCM Group in writing and the TCM Group shall be entitled to receive such
materials or information proposed to be destroyed.   ARTICLE VIII.  
TERMINATION OF LIABILITIES  Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, any liabilities determined under this Agreement shall not
terminate any earlier than the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitation for such liability. All other covenants under this Agreement shall

RULE 145 AFFILIATE AGREEMENT   [-], 2005   Triple Crown Media 546 East
Main Street Lexington, Kentucky 40508    Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have
been advised that, as of the date of this letter, I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Bull Run Corporation, a Georgia corporation (the "Company"),
as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). I have been further advised that,
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
[-], 2005 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Triple Crown Media, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), BR Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer ("Merger Sub"), and the Company, the
Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") and that, as a
result of the Merger, I may receive TCM Capital Stock (as such term is
defined in the Merger Agreement) in exchange for shares of Company Capital
Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by me.   I hereby
represent, warrant and covenant to Buyer that in the event I receive any TCM
Capital Stock as a result of the Merger:  a. I will not offer, sell,
transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise  dispose of, or reduce the
undersigned\'s interest in or risk relative  to, any shares of TCM Capital
Stock issued to the undersigned in the  Merger unless at such time either (i)
such transaction shall be  permitted pursuant to the provisions of Rule 145
under the Securities  Act; (ii) the undersigned shall have furnished to the
Buyer an opinion  of counsel, satisfactory to the Buyer, to the effect that
no  registration under the Securities Act would be required in connection 
with the proposed offer, sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other 
disposition; or (iii) a registration statement under the Securities Act 
covering the proposed offer, sale, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or  other
disposition shall be effective under the Securities Act.  b. I understand
that Buyer is under no obligation to register the sale,  transfer or other
disposition of TCM Capital Stock by me or on my  behalf under the Act.  c.
I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to  Buyer\'s
transfer agent with respect to shares of TCM Capital Stock  issued to me and
that there will be placed on      the certificates for such shares of TCM
Capital Stock issued to me, or  any substitutions therefor, a legend stating
in substance:   "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED
IN  A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT OF
1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE SOLD OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED
[-], 2005  BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND TRIPLE CROWN MEDIA, 
INC., A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL  OFFICES OF
TRIPLE CROWN MEDIA, INC."  d. I also understand that unless the transfer by
me of my TCM Capital  Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale
made in conformity  with the provisions of Rule 145, Buyer reserves the right
to put the  following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:  
"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED  FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH
SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO  WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933  APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH 
A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION  THEREOF WITHIN
THE MEANING OF SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY  NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN  ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION  REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."   It is
understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d)
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to Buyer a copy of a letter
from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, to the effect that such
legend is not required for purposes of the Act.   Very truly yours,
