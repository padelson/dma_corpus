Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and will be
deemed to have been disposed of to Royal in exchange for a cash payment by
Royal equal to the amount, if any, of the In-the-Money Amount of such Royal
Option, less any required withholding Taxes; and

  

(d) each RSU issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment
by Royal equal to $13.00 per RSU, less any required withholding Taxes.

  

 **2.2** Implementation Steps by Royal

  

Royal shall:

  

(a) as soon as reasonably practicable, apply in a manner acceptable to
Purchaser, acting reasonably, under the Act for an order approving the
Arrangement and in connection with such application Royal shall file and
diligently prosecute an application for an Interim Order providing for the
calling and holding of the Royal Meeting for the purpose of considering, and
if deemed advisable, approving the Transaction;

     

   

(b) subject to Section 2.5, convene and hold the Royal Meeting as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, but in any case, before the date that is
60 days from the date of the Agreement, for the purpose of considering the
Transaction Resolution and, with the consent of Purchaser, for any other
proper purpose as may be set out in the notice for such meeting;

  

(c) except as required for quorum purposes, not adjourn, postpone, cancel (or
propose the adjournment, postponement or cancellation of) or fail to call the
Royal Meeting without Purchasers prior written consent, except as required
by Law;

  

(d) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from the Royal
Shareholders proxies in favour of the approval of the Transaction Resolution
including, if so requested by Purchaser, using the services of dealers and
proxy solicitation services, and take all other action that is necessary or
desirable to secure the approval of the Transaction by the Royal
Shareholders;

  

(e) subject to obtaining the approvals as are required by the Interim Order,
use its best efforts to diligently pursue the application to the Court for
the Final Order; and

  

(f) subject to obtaining the Final Order and the satisfaction or waiver of
the other conditions herein contained in favour of each Party, on the date
contemplated in Section 2.6 send to the Director, for endorsement and filing
by the Director, the Articles of Arrangement and such other documents as may
be required in connection therewith under the Act to give effect to the
Transaction.

  

 **2.3** Implementation Steps by Purchaser

  

Purchaser shall, subject to obtaining the Final Order and the satisfaction or
waiver of the other conditions precedent contained in this Agreement in its
favour, on or before the Effective Date deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Depositary, immediately available funds equal to the aggregate cash
consideration payable under the Transaction.

  

 **2.4** Interim Order

  

The application referred to in Section 2.2(a) shall request that the Interim
Order provide:

  

(a) for the class of persons to whom notice is to be provided in respect of
the Plan of Arrangement and the Royal Meeting and for the manner in which
such notice is to be provided;

  

(b) that the requisite approval for the Transaction Resolution shall be 66
2/3% of the votes cast on the Transaction Resolution by the Royal
Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the Royal Meeting;

     

   

(c) that, in all other respects, the terms, restrictions and conditions of
the by-laws and articles of Royal, including quorum requirements and all
other matters, shall apply in respect of the Royal Meeting; and

  

(d) for the grant of the Dissent Rights.

  

 **2.5** The Royal Circular

  

As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
Royal shall prepare and complete, in consultation with Purchaser, the Royal
Circular (and any amendments thereto) together with any other documents
required by the Securities Act, the 1933 Act and the Exchange Act and other
applicable Laws in connection with the Royal Meeting and the Transaction. As
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, and after obtaining the
Interim Order, but subject to obtaining any required Regulatory Approvals in
connection with mailing the Royal Circular, Royal shall cause the Royal
Circular and other documentation required in connection with the
Royal Meeting to be sent to each Royal Shareholder and to be filed with
applicable Securities Authorities, as required by the Interim Order and
applicable Laws. Royal shall permit Purchaser to review and comment on drafts
of the Royal Circular and other documentation referred to above in the course
of its preparation and shall accept Purchasers reasonable comments thereto,
except to the extent that to do so would, in the reasonable opinion of the
Board of Directors of Royal based upon advice of outside legal counsel, (i)
result in the Royal Circular not containing information in sufficient detail
to permit a Royal Shareholder to form a reasoned judgment concerning the
Transaction or (ii) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Royal to
the Royal Shareholders. The Royal Circular, when filed by Royal with the
applicable Securities Authorities and mailed by Royal to the Royal
Shareholders, and at the time of the Royal Meeting, shall contain all
information that is required to be included therein in accordance with any
applicable Law, and shall comply with the requirements of applicable Law. The
terms of the Transaction, as described therein, shall comply with the terms
of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Royal
shall ensure that the Royal Circular provides Royal Shareholders with
information in sufficient detail to permit them to form a reasoned judgment
concerning the matters to be placed before them at the Royal Meeting.

  

 **2.6** Closing Matters

  

The Effective Date shall be a business day on or prior to the Outside Date
following the latest of the date of the Royal Meeting, the date of issuance
of the Final Order (or, if appealed, the date such appeal is delivered or
withdrawn), and the date upon which the last Regulatory Approval is obtained
(the latest of such dates being referred to herein as the " **Approvals Date**
"). The Effective Date shall be designated by Purchaser upon not less than
five (5) business days prior written notice to Royal; _provided, however_ ,
that the Effective Date so designated by Purchaser shall not, without Royals
consent, be later than thirty-five (35) calendar days after the Approvals
Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (i) unless Purchaser otherwise
agrees, Purchaser shall not be obligated to designate an Effective Date that
is earlier than fourteen (14)

     

   

calendar days after the date on which Royal provides to Purchaser the
Quarterly Financials; and (ii) in the event that the latest date for the
Effective Date as so determined in accordance with the preceding sentence and
the foregoing clause (i) would be within the last ten (10) days of a calendar
month, then Purchaser may, at its option, designate the last business day of
such month or the first business day of the next succeeding month as the
Effective Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, " **Quarterly
Financials** " shall mean the quarterly consolidated financial statements of
Royal which Purchasers financing sources request be used in connection with
arrangement of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Closing
shall take place at the office of Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP in Toronto,
Ontario at 9:00 a.m. on the Effective Date or at such other place, date and
time as the Parties shall agree (the " **Effective Time** "). Each of
Purchaser and Royal shall deliver, at the closing of the Transaction, such
customary certificates, resolutions and other closing documents as may
be required by the other Party, acting reasonably.

  

 **2.7** Preparation of Filings

  

(a) Purchaser and Royal shall co-operate in the preparation of the Royal
Circular and any application for the Regulatory Approvals and other orders,
registrations, consents, filings, rulings, exemptions, no-action letters and
approvals required in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction, and
the preparation of any documents reasonably deemed by either of the Parties
to be necessary to discharge its respective obligations or otherwise
advisable under applicable Laws in connection with this Agreement and the
Transaction as promptly as practicable hereafter.

  

(b) Each of the Parties shall furnish to the other of them, on a timely
basis, all information as may be required to effectuate the foregoing
actions, and each covenants that, to its knowledge, no information so
furnished by it in writing in connection with those actions or otherwise in
connection with the consummation of the actions contemplated by this
Agreement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in
which they are made (other than with respect to any information relating to
and provided by the other or any third party that is not an affiliate of one
of the Parties).

  

(c) Each of Royal and Purchaser shall promptly notify the other if at any
time before the Effective Time it becomes aware that the Royal Circular, an
application for a Regulatory Approval or any other order, registration,
consent, ruling, exemption, no-action letter or approval in connection with
the Transaction or this Agreement, any registration statement or any circular
or other filing under applicable Laws contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light
of the circumstances in which they are made, or that

     

   

otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to the Royal Circular, such
application, registration statement, circular or filing, and the Parties
shall co-operate in the preparation of such amendment or supplement as
required.

  

 **2.8** Withholding

  

Purchaser, Royal or the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable to any Royal Securityholder pursuant to
Section 2.1 such amounts as Purchaser, Royal or the Depositary determines it
is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment
under the Tax Act, the Code or any provision of federal, provincial,
territorial, state, local or foreign tax Laws, in each case, as amended. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Royal
Securityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made,
provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority.

  

 **2.9** Shareholder Communications

  

Royal and Purchaser shall co-operate in the preparation of presentations, if
any, to investors regarding the Transaction, and no Party shall issue any
press release or otherwise make public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the Transaction without the consent of the other Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld) and Royal shall not make any filing with
any Governmental Entity (including any Exchange) with respect thereto without
the consent of Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and
Purchaser shall not make any filing with any Governmental Entity or with any
Exchange in connection with the Transaction without the consent of Royal
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that
the foregoing shall be subject to each Partys overriding obligation to make
any disclosure or filing required under applicable Laws, and the Party making
such disclosure shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to give prior
oral or written notice to the other Party and reasonable opportunity to
review or comment on the disclosure or filing, and if such prior notice is
not possible, to give such notice immediately following the making of such
disclosure or filing.

  

 **2.10** Depositary

  

Royal shall permit the Transfer Agent for Royal Shares to act as Depositary
in connection with the Transaction and instruct the Transfer Agent to furnish
to Purchaser (and such persons as it may designate) at such times as it may
request such information and provide to Purchaser (and such persons as it may
designate) such other assistance as it may request in connection with the
implementation and completion of the Transaction.

     

   

 **ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ROYAL**

  

 **3.1** Representations and Warranties

  

Royal hereby represents to and in favour of Purchaser as follows and
acknowledges that Purchaser is relying upon such representations and
warranties in connection with the entering into of this Agreement:

  

(a) **Board Approval.** The Board of Directors of Royal has determined
unanimously that the Transaction is fair to the Royal Shareholders and is in
the best interests of Royal and has resolved unanimously to recommend to the
Royal Shareholders that they vote in favour of the Transaction Resolution.
The special committee of the Board of Directors of Royal has received a
Fairness Opinion from BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. and has approved the Transaction
Resolution and the execution and performance of this Agreement and
consummation of the Transaction.

  

(b) **Organization and Qualification.**

  

(i) Royal is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of Canada, and has the requisite corporate or other
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties as now owned,
leased and operated and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Royal is duly registered or otherwise authorized to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of its
properties, owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held, or the nature of its
activities makes such registration necessary, except where the failure to be
so registered or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Royal, each of such jurisdictions being listed in Section 3.1(b)(i) of the
Disclosure Letter.

  

(ii) Section 3.1(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each entity, joint venture, partnership or trust, together
with its jurisdiction and percentage ownership interests thereof in which
Royal, directly or indirectly, has an ownership interest as of the date of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, each subsidiary of Royal
(collectively, the " **Royal Subsidiaries** "). Royal owns the ownership
interests in each Royal Subsidiary reflected as owned by it in Section
3.1(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter free and clear of all Liens, and, except
as set forth in Section 3.1(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter, no Royal
Subsidiary is obligated to issue any capital stock or other securities to any
other person. Each Royal Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated or an
entity duly created, validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation,

     

   

continuance or creation and has the requisite corporate or other power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties as now owned, leased and
operated and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each
Royal Subsidiary is duly registered or otherwise authorized to do business
and each is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of
its properties owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held, or the nature of
its activities makes such registration necessary, except where the failure to
be so registered or in good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Royal, each of such jurisdictions being listed in 3.1(b)(ii) of the
Disclosure Letter.

  

(c) **Authority Relative to this Agreement.** Royal has the requisite
corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement has been
duly authorized by the Board of Directors of Royal, and, other than approval
of the Transaction by the Royal Shareholders at the Royal Meeting, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Royal are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by it of this Agreement and consummation of
the Transaction. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Royal
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Royal enforceable
against Royal in accordance with its terms, subject to the qualification that
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of
creditors and that equitable remedies, including specific performance, are
discretionary and may not be ordered (collectively, the "
**Enforceability Exceptions** ").

  

(d) **No Violations.**

  

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Royal nor
consummation of the Transaction nor compliance by Royal with any of the
provisions hereof will: (1) except as set forth in Section 3.1(d)(i) of the
Disclosure Letter, violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provision of, require any consent, approval or notice under, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) or result in a right of termination or acceleration
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon, any of the material
properties or assets of Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries, or in any
such Lien becoming (or being capable of becoming) enforceable against any
such material properties or assets, or cause any material indebtedness to
come due before its stated maturity or cause any material credit commitment
or obligation to cease to be available or cause any material payment or other
obligation to be imposed on Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries under any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of (A) their respective charters or
by-laws or other

     

   

comparable organizational documents or (B) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, loan agreement, deed of trust, Lien, or other Material Contract to
which Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries is a party or to which any of
them, or any of their respective properties or assets, may be subject or by
which Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries is bound; (2) subject to
obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, (x) violate any Law applicable to Royal
or any of the Royal Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets; or (y) cause the suspension or revocation of any material Permit
currently in effect; (3) except as set forth in Section 3.1(d)(i) of the
Disclosure Letter, result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
current or former director, officer or employee of Royal or any of the Royal
Subsidiaries or result in any increase or acceleration of contributions,
liabilities or benefits, or acceleration of vesting, under any Royal Plan or
restriction imposed on any asset held in connection with a Royal Plan; or (4)
restrict, hinder, impair or limit the ability of Royal or any of the Royal
Subsidiaries to carry on the business of Royal or the Royal Subsidiaries as
and where it is now being carried on.

  

(ii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity or other person is required to be
obtained by Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by Royal of the
Transaction other than (A) any approvals required by the Interim Order, (B)
the Final Order, (C) filings under the Act contemplated by this Agreement,
(D) the Regulatory Approvals, (E) filings under the Securities Act, Exchange
rules and similar Laws as contemplated by this Agreement, and (F) the
other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, declarations or filings of
or with a Governmental Entity (excluding those consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, declarations or filings relating to the specific
character of Purchaser) that are set out in the Disclosure Letter.

  

(e) **Capitalization.** The authorized share capital of Royal consists of an
unlimited number of Royal Shares. As of the close of business on June 8,
2006, there are issued and outstanding 93,444,502 Royal Shares, and there are
outstanding no other shares of any class or series in the capital of Royal.
As of the close of business on June 8, 2006, an aggregate of up to 2,260,828
Royal Shares are issuable upon the exercise of the Royal Options, an
aggregate of up to 1,145,000 Royal Shares are issuable upon the exercise of
RSUs, and except as set forth above, there are no options, warrants or other
rights, shareholder rights plans, agreements or commitments of any character
whatsoever requiring or which may require the issuance, sale or transfer by
Royal of any shares of Royal (including

   

20   

 

  

Royal Shares) or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, or otherwise evidencing a right to acquire, any shares of
Royal (including Royal Shares). All outstanding Royal Shares have been duly
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are not
subject to, nor were they issued in violation of, any pre-emptive rights, and
all Royal Shares issuable upon the exercise of rights under the Royal Options
and RSUs in accordance with their respective terms have been duly authorized
and, upon issuance, will be validly issued as fully paid and non-assessable
and will not be subject to any pre-emptive rights. All securities of Royal
(including the Royal Shares, the Royal Options, RSUs and all options, rights
or other convertible or exchangeable securities) have been issued in
compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable securities Laws.
Except as set forth above in this paragraph (e), there are no securities of
Royal or of any Royal Subsidiary outstanding which have the right to vote
generally (or are convertible into or exchangeable for securities having the
right to vote generally) with the Royal Shareholders on any matter. There are
no outstanding contractual or other obligations of Royal or any Royal
Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its securities
or with respect to the voting or disposition of any outstanding securities of
any of its respective subsidiaries.

  

(f) **Reporting Status and Securities Laws Matters.** Royal is a "reporting
issuer" and not on the list of reporting issuers in default under the
applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities Laws and a
"foreign private issuer" as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the 1933
Act and, except as set forth in Section 3.1(f) of the Disclosure Letter, is
not in default of any material requirements of any securities Laws. Except as
set forth in Section 3.1(f) of the Disclosure Letter, no delisting,
suspension of trading in or cease trading order with respect to
any securities of Royal, and, to the knowledge of Royal, no inquiry, review
or investigation (formal or informal) of any Securities Authority, is in
effect or ongoing or, to the knowledge of Royal, expected to be implemented
or undertaken.

  

(g) **Reports.** Since December 31, 2003, Royal has filed or furnished all
forms, reports, statements and documents required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act (the " **OSC Reports** "), and the Exchange Act (the " **SEC
Reports** " and, together with the OSC Reports, the " **Public Disclosure
Documents** ") on SEDAR, in the case of the OSC Reports, and on EDGAR, in the
case of the SEC Reports. The Public Disclosure Documents (i) were prepared in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder as the case may be, and (ii) did not, at the time they
were filed, or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required

     

   

to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
except as may be alleged as described in Section 3.1(g) of the
Disclosure Letter. No Royal Subsidiary is required to file or furnish any
form, report or other document with or to the Securities Authorities. Royal
has not filed any confidential material change report with any of the
Securities Authorities that remains confidential as of the date hereof.

  

(h) **Financial Statements.** As of their respective dates, Royals
consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference into
the Public Disclosure Documents (including the notes thereto and related
managements discussion and analysis (" **MD andA**")) (collectively, the "
**Royal Financial Statements** ") were prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied (except (A) as otherwise indicated in such financial
statements and the notes thereto or, in the case of audited statements, in
the related report of Royals independent auditors, (B) in the case of
unaudited interim statements, may omit notes which are not required by
applicable Laws in the unaudited statements, or (C) as such
financial statements have been presented in a filing with the OSC on May 4,
2005) and fairly present the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and changes in financial position of Royal and the Royal
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for the periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements, to
normal period-end adjustments which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, expected to be material) and reflect reserves required by GAAP
consistently applied in respect of all material contingent liabilities, if
any, of Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. There has
been no change in Royals accounting policies, except as described in the
notes to the Royal Financial Statements, since December 31, 2003.

  

(i) **Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.** Neither Royal nor any of the
Royal Subsidiaries has any material liabilities (absolute, accrued,
contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise) or obligations, and there
is no existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that
could reasonably be expected to result in such a material liability or
obligation, except (i) liabilities or obligations fully reflected or reserved
against in Royals consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 (or the
notes thereto) included in the Royal Financial Statements, (ii) liabilities
or obligations incurred since December 31, 2005 in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice or (iii) as set forth in Section
3.1(i) of the Disclosure Letter.

  

(j) **Books, Records and Disclosure Controls.** Royal is in compliance with
and has complied with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and
applicable requirements of the Exchanges. There are no outstanding loans made
by Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as
defined under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of Royal,

     

   

other than loans listed in Section 3.1(j) of the Disclosure Letter that were
outstanding at the time of the effectiveness of the applicability of Section
402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to Royal and that have not been amended or
modified since that time. Since the effectiveness of the applicability of
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to Royal, neither Royal nor any of the
Royal Subsidiaries has made any loans to any executive officer or director of
Royal. The records, systems, controls, data and information of Royal and the
Royal Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Royal or the Royal Subsidiaries, except for any non-
exclusive ownership or non-direct control that would not have a material
adverse effect on Royal. Royal has designed disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that material information is made known to its
management by others within Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries and is in the
process of devising a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that (a) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization; and (b)
transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting
procedures, or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (B) to
maintain accountability for assets. Royals and the Royal Subsidiaries
corporate records and minute books have been maintained substantially in
compliance with applicable Laws and are complete and accurate in all material
respects.

  

(k) **Litigation.** Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k) of the Disclosure
Letter, (i) there are no claims, actions, suits (whether civil,
administrative, investigative or informal), arbitrations, reviews, audits,
hearings, investigations, litigations or proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Royal, threatened affecting Royal or any of the Royal
Subsidiaries or affecting any of their respective property or assets at law
or in equity before or by any Governmental Entity or arbitrator, including
matters arising under Environmental Laws and including claims related to
warranty, negligence, performance or other claims or disputes in respect of
products or services currently being delivered (each a " **Proceeding**
"), and (ii) to the knowledge of Royal, there are no events or
circumstances that would be reasonably expected to give rise to material
Proceedings, or material potential Proceedings, against Royal or any of the
Royal Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(k) of the Disclosure
Letter, neither Royal nor any of the Royal Subsidiaries nor their respective
assets or properties is subject to any outstanding judgment, order, writ,
injunction, administrative decision or award, quasi-judicial decision or
award, assessment, ruling, restriction, charge or decree of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent.

     

   

(l) **Restrictions on Business Activities.** Except as set out in Section
3.1(l) of the Disclosure Letter there is no contract, judgment, injunction,
order or decree binding upon Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries that has
or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
the effect of prohibiting, materially restricting or impairing any material
business practice of Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries, any material
acquisition of property by Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries or the
conduct of business by Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries as currently
conducted in all material respects.

  

(m) **Taxes.** Except as disclosed in Section 3.1(m) of the Disclosure
Letter, Royal and each Royal Subsidiary has duly and timely filed all
material Returns required to be filed by it prior to the date hereof, other
than those which have been administratively waived, and all such Returns are
complete and correct in all material respects. Royal and each
Royal Subsidiary has paid on a timely basis all material Taxes which are due
and payable, including all installments on account of Taxes for the current
year that are due and payable, all assessments and reassessments, and all
other Taxes due and payable by it on or before the date hereof, whether or
not assessed by the appropriate Governmental Authority, other than those
which are being or have been contested in good faith and in respect of which
adequate reserves have been provided in the most recently published Royal
Financial Statements. Neither Royal nor any of the Royal Subsidiaries has any
material liability for unpaid Taxes accruing after the date of the most
recently published Royal Financial Statements except for Taxes arising in the
ordinary course of business subsequent to the date of the most recently
published Royal Financial Statements and with respect to which adequate
reserves have been provided in the books and records of Royal and the Royal
Subsidiaries. Except as provided for in the Royal Financial Statements and
except as disclosed in Section 3.1(m) of the Disclosure Letter, no material
assessments, deficiencies, litigation, proposed adjustments or matters in
controversy, proceedings, investigations, audits, matters under discussion or
appeal exist or have been asserted with respect to Taxes of Royal or any
Royal Subsidiary, and neither Royal nor any of the Royal Subsidiaries is a
party to any action or proceeding for assessment or collection of material
Taxes and no such event has been asserted or, to the knowledge of Royal,
threatened against Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets.

  

For all periods ended on and after December 31, 2001, true and complete
copies of (i) all relevant portions of material Tax audit reports,
assessments, reassessments, statements of deficiencies, communications,
settlements or other agreements relating to Taxes received by Royal or the
Royal Subsidiaries or on behalf of Royal or any Royal Subsidiary from a
Governmental Entity or sent by or on behalf of Royal or any Royal Subsidiary
to a Governmental Entity, and (ii) all material federal, provincial, state,
local or foreign Returns for Royal or any Royal Subsidiary have been made
available by Royal for inspection by Purchaser.

     

   

Neither Royal nor any of the Royal Subsidiaries has (i) engaged in a
"reportable transaction," as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011 4(b), or any transaction that is the same as or substantially similar
to one of the types of transactions referred to as "listed transactions" in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011 4(b)(2), (ii) has ever been a member of
a consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of which Royal or
Royal Plastics Group (USA) Limited was not the ultimate parent company, (iii)
been the "distributing company" or the "controlled company" (in each case,
within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1) of the Code) with respect to
a transaction described in Section 355 of the Code (A) within the two-year

the master or prototype plan document is acceptable for the implementation of
a qualified retirement plan),

Subsidiaries and no Taxes, penalties or fees are owing or exigible under or
in relation to any Royal Plan;

obligations hereunder. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the completion by Purchaser of the Transaction have been
duly authorized by the Board of Directors of Purchaser, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Purchaser are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by it of this Agreement or the completion of the
Transaction. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

  

(b) **No Violations.**

  

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser nor the
completion of the Transaction nor compliance by Purchaser with any of the
provisions hereof or thereof will violate, conflict with, or result in a
breach of any provision of, require any consent, approval or notice under, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under (A) Purchasers articles of
incorporation or (B) any material contract or other instrument or obligation
to which Purchaser is a party or to which its properties or assets, may be
subject or by which Purchaser is bound and, in each case, individually or in
the aggregate, would materially adversely affect Purchasers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  

(ii) Subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals and other than in
connection with or in compliance with the provisions of applicable corporate,
competition, antitrust and securities Laws, (1) there is no legal impediment
to the completion of the Transaction by

     

   

Purchaser, and (2) no filing or registration with, or authorization, consent
or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required of Purchaser in
connection with the completion of the Transaction, except for such filings or
registrations which, if not made, or for such authorizations, consents or
approvals which, if not received, would not prevent or materially delay the
completion of the Transaction by Purchaser.

  

(c) **Financing.** On the date hereof, Purchaser delivered to Royal a true
and correct executed copy of the Commitment Letter in the form previously
provided to Royal. The Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties
thereto. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of Purchaser under the
Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, Purchaser has no reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letter.
In addition, assuming that all information provided by Royal and/or its
advisors relating to the calculation was accurate and complete, as of March
31, 2006, on a pro forma basis (pro forma for the closing of the
transactions contemplated herein and in the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, including, without limitation, application of proceeds
from planned divestitures, sale of real estate and anticipated pre-closing
cash flow) the combined entity was in compliance with the "leverage test" set
forth in the Commitment Letter.

  

(d) **Solvency.** Assuming that Royal and its subsidiaries are Solvent on the
Effective Date immediately prior, and without giving effect to, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Royal and its subsidiaries will
be Solvent on the Effective Date, after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the incurrence of any financings in
connection therewith.

  

 **4.2** Survival of Representations and Warranties

  

The representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement
shall expire and be terminated at the Effective Time.

expected to prohibit Purchaser from effectively controlling in any material
respect the business or operations of Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries
or (v) which arises after the date of this Agreement and is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Royal or Purchaser;

  

(f) Holders of Royal Shares shall not have exercised the Dissent Rights or
similar rights, and shall not have instituted proceedings to exercise the
Dissent Rights or similar rights, in connection with the Transaction (other
than holders of Royal Shares representing, in the aggregate, not more than
10% of the outstanding Royal Shares);

  

(g) all consents and waivers from any Persons (other than Governmental
Entities) required under the terms of any of the Material Contracts with
respect to the acquisition of control by Purchaser, shall have been duly
obtained or given, as the case may be, at or before the Effective Time on
terms satisfactory to Purchaser acting reasonably except for any which the
failure to obtain or provide does not and would not reasonably be expected to
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Royal;

     

   

(h) other than the Regulatory Approvals, all other consents, waivers,
Permits, orders and approvals of any Governmental Entity, and the expiry of
any waiting periods, in connection with, or required to permit, the
consummation of the Transaction, the failure of which to obtain would render
completion of the Transaction unlawful or which would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser and/or Royal, shall have been
obtained or satisfied on terms that would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser and/or Royal;

  

(i) the board of directors of Royal shall not have approved or recommended
any Acquisition Proposal;

  

(j) no person other than Purchaser shall have entered into a definitive
agreement or an agreement in principle with Royal with respect to an

(l) none of a Market MAC, Royals breach of Section 7.7 or any of its
other material agreements and covenants contained herein, or a material
variance in Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries financial performance from that
anticipated as of the date hereof, shall have resulted in Purchaser failing
to receive funds in the amount contemplated by the Commitment Letter pursuant
to its terms; and

  

(m) Purchaser shall have been provided "payoff" letters from the providers of
Royal Third Party Debt that is bank debt in form and content satisfactory to
Purchaser.

  

(2) Purchaser may not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the conditions
precedent in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 if the condition precedent was not
satisfied principally as a result of a material default by Purchaser in
complying with its obligations under this Agreement.

  

 **6.3** Additional Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of Royal

  

(1) The obligations of Royal to complete the Transaction shall also be
subject to the satisfaction, on or before the Effective Time, of each of the
following conditions precedent (each of which is for the exclusive benefit of
Royal and may be waived by Royal):

  

(a) each agreement and covenant of Purchaser under this Agreement to be
performed on or before the Effective Time shall have been duly performed by
Purchaser in all material respects, and Royal shall have received a
certificate of Purchaser addressed to Royal and dated the Effective Date,
signed on behalf of Purchaser by two senior executive officers of

   

50   

 

  

Purchaser (on Purchasers behalf and without personal liability), confirming
the same as at the Effective Date;

  

(b) (i) the representations and warranties of Purchaser that are qualified by
references to materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall be true and
correct on the date hereof and as of the Effective Time; and (ii) the
representations and warranties of Purchaser not so qualified shall be true
and correct in all material respects, in each case on the date hereof and as
of the Effective Time as if made on and as of such time; and Royal shall have

Effective Date, signed on behalf of Purchaser by two senior executive
officers of Purchaser (on Purchasers behalf and without personal liability),
confirming the same as at the Effective Date;

  

(c) the board of directors of Purchaser shall have adopted all necessary
resolutions, and all other necessary corporate action shall have been taken
by Purchaser to permit the consummation of the Transaction; and

  

(d) Purchaser shall have deposited the aggregate cash purchase price payable
under the Transaction for the Royal Shares, Royal Options and RSUs with the
Depositary.

  

(2) Royal may not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the conditions
precedent in Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 if the condition precedent was not
satisfied principally as a result of a material default by Royal in complying
with its obligations in this Agreement.

  

 **6.4** Satisfaction, Waiver and Release of Conditions

  

The conditions precedent set out in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 shall be
conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released when, with the
agreement of Purchaser and Royal, a Certificate of Arrangement in respect of
the Transaction is issued by the Director.

  

 **ARTICLE 7 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  

 **7.1** Non-Solicitation

  

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article 7, Royal shall not, directly
or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, representative,
lawyer, banker, financial advisor or other agent of Royal or any of the
Royal Subsidiaries, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage (including
by way of furnishing information or entering into any form of
agreement, arrangement or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or
proposals regarding, constituting or that may reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, or amend or waive the terms of any standstill
or confidentiality agreement with respect to any person in any manner that
would facilitate the making or implementation of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify, or propose

     

   

publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Purchaser, the
recommendation to Royal Shareholders of the Board of Directors of Royal of
the Transaction, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (v) accept or enter into, or propose
publicly to accept or enter into, any agreement, understanding or arrangement
in respect of an Acquisition Proposal or providing for payment of any break,
termination or other fees or expenses to any person in the event Royal
consummates the Transaction; provided that, subject to the further provisions
of this Article 7, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Board of Directors of Royal, at any time prior to approval of the Transaction
Resolution by the Royal Shareholders, from considering, negotiating, entering
into a confidentiality agreement and providing information pursuant to
Section 7.1(4), accepting, approving, recommending to Royal Shareholders or
entering into an agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a
_bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal received after the date
hereof that:

  

(a) contemplates the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of all or
substantially all of the outstanding Royal Shares or all or substantially all
of the assets of Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries;

  

(b) did not result from a breach of this Section 7.1; and

  

(c) in respect of which the Board of Directors of Royal determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and its
outside counsel, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal will, at the time of
Royals entering into a definitive agreement in respect thereof, be financed
(to at least the extent that the Transaction is financed as of the date
hereof as set forth in the Commitment Letter), (B) there is a substantial
likelihood that the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal
will be consummated in accordance with its terms without undue delay, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
Acquisition Proposal and the person making such Acquisition Proposal and (C)
such Acquisition Proposal is more favourable to Royal Shareholders, from a
financial point of view, than the Transaction (taking into account any
changes to the financial terms of the Transaction proposed by Purchaser in
response to such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise), such that acceptance of
such Acquisition Proposal is necessary to fulfill the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of Royal to the Royal Shareholders

  

(any such Acquisition Proposal being referred to herein as a " **Superior
Proposal** ").

  

(2) Royal shall, and shall cause the officers, directors, employees,
representatives, lawyers, bankers, financial advisors and agents of Royal and
the Royal Subsidiaries to, immediately terminate any existing discussions or
negotiations with any parties (other than Purchaser) with respect to any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to constitute, an
Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly request

     

   

each person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of a potential transaction in respect of
Royal to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished
by Royal or any of the Royal Subsidiaries to such person, and shall enforce,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any
such agreements, including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court having
jurisdiction.

  

(3) Royal shall promptly notify Purchaser of, at first orally and then in
writing, and promptly provide to Purchaser a copy of, any Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case
received after the date hereof of which any of its directors or officers
become aware, or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request for non-
public information relating to Royal or any Royal Subsidiary in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or
records of Royal or any Royal Subsidiary by any person that informs Royal
or such Royal Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made,
an Acquisition Proposal and any amendment thereto and a description of
the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, and shall provide the identity of the person making such Acquisition
Proposal and such other details of the proposal or inquiry as Purchaser may
reasonably request. Royal shall (i) keep Purchaser fully informed of the
status including any change to the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry; and (ii) provide to Purchaser copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Royal by any
person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or sent or
provided by Royal to any person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry immediately after receipt or delivery thereof.

  

(4) If Royal receives a request for material non-public information from a
person who proposes an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and
the Board of Directors of Royal determines that such proposal would be,
if consummated in accordance with its terms, a Superior Proposal, then, and
only in such case, the Board of Directors of Royal may, subject to the
execution by such person of a confidentiality agreement having substantially
the same terms as the Confidentiality Agreement (including a standstill
provision no less stringent than the standstill provision set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement), provide such person with access to information
regarding Royal, acting reasonably; provided, however that Royal sends a copy
of any such confidentiality agreement to Purchaser immediately upon its
execution and Purchaser is immediately provided with a list and copies of all
information provided to such person not previously provided to Purchaser and
is immediately provided with access to information similar to that which was
provided to such person.

  

(5) Royal shall notify Purchaser immediately upon its Board of Directors
making any determination of the type described in clause (c) of paragraph 1
above and, notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Article 7 to
the contrary, may accept, approve, recommend or enter into any agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal if, and only
if, (i) it has provided Purchaser with a copy of the documents related to the
Acquisition Proposal that has been determined to be a Superior Proposal, (ii)
not less than 8 business days shall have elapsed from the date

     

   

Purchaser received written notice advising that Royals Board of Directors
has made the determination described in clause (c) of paragraph 1 above,
specifying the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and the person
making the Superior Proposal, and Royal shall have complied with its
obligations set forth in paragraph 6 below, and (iii) Royal has previously or
concurrently will have paid to Purchaser the termination fee set forth in
Section 7.2 and terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(g).

  

(6) During the above-described 8 business day period, Royal agrees that
Purchaser shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the
terms of this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Royal will review and
negotiate in good faith (and promptly make its financial and legal advisors
available to negotiate in good faith) any offer by Purchaser to amend the
terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to determine whether
Purchasers offer as so revised would result in the Superior Proposal ceasing
to be a Superior Proposal. If the Board of Directors of Royal so determines,
it will enter into an amended agreement with Purchaser reflecting Purchasers
amended proposal. If the Board of Directors of Royal continues to believe, in
good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that the Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, then it
shall promptly notify Purchaser of such determination. Each successive
modification of a Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Superior Proposal
for purposes of this paragraph 6, initiating a new 8 business day notice and
negotiation period.

  

(7) Royal shall ensure that its officers and directors and those of the Royal
Subsidiaries and any financial or other advisors or representatives retained
by it are aware of the provisions of this Section, and it shall be
responsible for any breach of this Section by any such person or its advisors
or representatives.

  

(8) Nothing contained in this Section 7.1 shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of Royal from (i) making any disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal
to the Royal Shareholders prior to the Effective Time if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of Royal, after consultation with outside
counsel, such disclosure is necessary for the Board of Directors of Royal to
fulfill its fiduciary duties to the Royal Shareholders or is otherwise
required under applicable Law; (ii) taking any other action with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal to the extent ordered or otherwise mandated by any court
of competent jurisdiction; and (iii) responding to a bona fide request for
information that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal solely by advising that no information can be provided unless a
_bona fide_  written Acquisition Proposal is made and then only in compliance
with Section 7.1(4).

  

(9) Nothing contained in this Section 7.1 shall limit in any way the
obligation of Royal to convene and hold the Royal Meeting in accordance with
Section 2.2 of this Agreement unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article 8.

  

 **7.2** Agreement as to Damages

  

Notwithstanding any other provision relating to the payment of fees,
including the payment of brokerage fees, if after the execution of this
Agreement the Transaction is not

     

   

consummated because (a) (i) Purchaser or Royal terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2(c), (ii) prior to the date of the Royal Meeting an
Acquisition Proposal was made or publicly disclosed and not publicly
withdrawn prior to the date of the Royal Meeting, and (iii) concurrently with
such termination, or within 12 months after such termination, Royal enters
into an agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (or with respect
to another Acquisition Proposal negotiated with the proponent of such
Acquisition Proposal, or an affiliate of such proponent), or submits such
Acquisition Proposal (or another Acquisition Proposal made or publicly
announced by the proponent of such Acquisition Proposal, or an affiliate of
such proponent) to its shareholders, or such Acquisition Proposal (or another
Acquisition Proposal made or publicly announced by the proponent of such
Acquisition Proposal, or an affiliate of such proponent) is consummated; (b)
a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Royal
Shareholders and after such Acquisition Proposal shall have been made, this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.2(1)(d) or Section 8.2(1)(h);
(c) Purchaser shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.2(1)(f); or (d) Royal shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.2(1)(g), then Royal shall pay to Purchaser the amount of
$20,000,000 as liquidated damages in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Purchaser. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
term "affiliate" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the 1933 Act.
Such payment will be made (A) in the case of a termination by Purchaser or
Royal under (a) above, within two business days of the first to occur of any
of the events described in (a)(iii), (B) in the case of a termination by
Purchaser other than under clause (a) above, within two business days after
Purchasers written notice of termination, and (C) in the case of a
termination by Royal other than under clause (a) above, immediately prior to
such termination.

  

If (i) the Outside Date has occurred, (ii) all of the conditions to closing
have been and are satisfied and Purchaser and Royal would be required to
consummate the Transaction but Purchaser is unable to do so solely because
Purchaser has not received funds in the amount contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, and (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Royal or the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 8.2.1(h), then Purchaser shall, within two business days
after written notice of such termination, pay to Royal the amount of
$20,000,000 as liquidated damages in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Royal.

  

 **7.3** Fees and Expenses

  

Except as provided in Section 7.2 and Section 7.4, each Party shall pay all
fees, costs and expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this
Agreement and the Transaction.

  

 **7.4** Liquidated Damages and Injunctive Relief

  

Each Party acknowledges that the payment amounts set forth in Section 7.2 is
payment of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages
which the Party entitled to such damages will suffer or incur as a result of
the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this
Agreement and are not penalties.

     

   

Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence
that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater
certainty, the Parties agree that payment of the amounts set forth in Section
7.2 in the manner provided in respect thereof is the sole monetary remedy of
the Party receiving such payment; provided, however, that nothing contained
in this Section 7.4, and no payment under Section 7.2 of this Agreement,
shall relieve or have the effect of relieving any Party in any way from
liability for damages incurred or suffered by a Party as a result of an
intentional or willful breach of this Agreement, or from seeking damages,
costs and other expenses from the other Party for any breach of this
Agreement that does not give rise to the payment of damages in accordance
with the provisions of Section 7.2. For the avoidance of doubt, a breach by
Purchaser of its representations in Section 4.1(c) or of its covenants in
Section 5.3(2), in either case, that is not intentional or willful, or a
breach by Purchaser of Section 2.3, shall not give rise to a separate cause
of action on the part of Royal if Royal receives the payment provided for in
the second paragraph of Section 7.2 above. Nothing contained herein shall
preclude a Party from seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or
threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement
or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to obtain specific performance
of any of such acts, covenants or agreements, without the necessity of
posting a bond or security in connection therewith.

  

 **7.5** Access to Information: Confidentiality

  

Subject to applicable Laws, from the date hereof until the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, Royal shall, and shall
cause the Royal Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, employees, independent auditors, accounting advisers and agents
to, afford to Purchaser and to the officers, employees, agents and
representatives of Purchaser such access as Purchaser may reasonably require
at all reasonable times, including for the purpose of facilitating
integration business planning, to their officers, employees, agents,
properties, books, records and Contracts, and shall furnish Purchaser with
all data and information as Purchaser may reasonably request (which shall
include, without limitation, allowing Deloitte and Touche LLP to conduct site
visits and have reasonable access to financial records and systems).
Purchaser and Royal acknowledge and agree that information furnished pursuant
to this Section shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

 **7.6** Insurance and Indemnification

  

(1) Royal and Purchaser agree that, prior to the Effective Date, Royal will
purchase "run-off" directors and officers liability insurance providing
protection comparable to the protection provided by the policies maintained
by Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries which are in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Date and providing protection in respect of claims arising from
facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Date for a period of
six years after the Effective Date; provided that Royal shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such insurance coverage at the
lowest cost possible and in no event shall Royal expend an amount in
excess of $3,500,000 **** for such insurance coverage, **** and if the cost
of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,

     

   

Royal shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a substantially
similar policy with the greatest coverage available (as to quantum and
events) for such maximum cost.

  

(2) Purchaser agrees that all indemnification or exculpation obligations of
Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries existing on the date of this Agreement in
favour of present and former officers, directors and employees of Royal and
the Royal Subsidiaries shall survive the completion of the Transaction and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
(including any terms requiring an undertaking of the indemnified person to
repay amounts advanced upon a finding that the indemnified person has not met
the required standard of conduct), and Purchaser shall guarantee the
performance of all such obligations.

  

(3) Concurrently with the resignation of the current directors of Royal,
Royal shall provide to each such director a full and final release and
discharge from all claims and potential claims arising out of, or in any way
related to, such individuals acting as directors and/or officers of Royal,
such release to be in mutually acceptable form.

  

(4) The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified Person, his or her heirs
and his or her legal representatives and, for such purpose, Royal hereby
confirms that it is acting as agent and trustee on their behalf.

  

 **7.7** Financing

  

Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, at Royals cost and expense,
Royal shall, and shall cause the Royal Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective officers and
advisors, including legal and accounting, of Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries
to, provide to Purchaser, all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser
that is reasonably necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries, including (i) to the extent reasonably
necessary to effect such financing, participation in meetings, presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii)
using its commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the preparation of
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and other materials
contemplated by the financing described in the Commitment Letter to the
extent, if any, required in connection with such financing, (iii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to furnish Purchaser and its financing
sources with financial statements and related information, including
audited consolidated financial statements for such periods as are required
in connection with such financing and other financial and other
pertinent information regarding Royal and the Royal Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with such financing,
including all financial statements and financial data of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the 1933 Act, (iv) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters if and as
reasonably requested by Purchaser, (v) using its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide monthly financial statements (excluding notes thereto)
within forty-five (45) days of the end of each month prior to the Effective
Time, and (vi) using all reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary and
appropriate to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the financing
contemplated by the

   

57   

 

  

Commitment Letter to evaluate Royals and the Royal Subsidiaries current
assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and procedures
relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral arrangements and
(B) establishing bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and
lock box arrangements effective with respect to the period commencing at the
Effective Time. Royal hereby consents to the use of the logos of Royal and
the Royal Subsidiaries in connection with the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter. Royal will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts
to devise a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization; and (b) transactions are
recorded as necessary (A) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with United States generally accepted accounting procedures, or
any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (B) to maintain
accountability for assets.

  

 **ARTICLE 8 
 TERM, TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

  

 **8.2** Termination

  

(1) This Agreement may:

  

(a) be terminated by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Royal duly
authorized by their respective boards of directors (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, without the necessity of further action on the part of the Royal
Shareholders if terminated after the holding of the Royal Meeting);

  

(b) be terminated either by Purchaser or by Royal if any Law renders

(d) be terminated by Purchaser, if there has been a breach of or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Royal set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.2(1)(a) or 6.2(1)(b) not to
be satisfied and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date;

  

(e) be terminated by Royal, if there has been a breach of or failure to
perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

     

   

(i) would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.3(1)(a) or 6.3(1)(b) not
to be satisfied and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date;

  

(f) be terminated by Purchaser if the Board of Directors of Royal shall have:
(i) withdrawn, qualified or modified in a manner adverse to Purchaser its
approval or recommendation of the Transaction, (ii) approved, recommended,
accepted or entered into an Acquisition Proposal or, approved, recommended,
accepted or entered into an agreement, undertaking or arrangement in respect

agreement permitted by Section 7.1(4)), subject to compliance with Section
7.1 and provided that no termination under this Section 8.2(1)(g) shall be
effective unless and until Royal shall have paid to Purchaser the
amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 7.2; or

  

(h) be terminated either by Purchaser or by Royal if the Effective Date does
not occur on or prior to the Outside Date, provided that the failure of the
Effective Date to so occur is not the result of the breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by the Party terminating this Agreement,

  

in each case, prior to the Effective Time.

  

(2) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of
no further force or effect and no Party shall have any further obligations
hereunder except as provided in Sections 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 and the
Confidentiality Agreement and as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby, and
provided that neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything
contained in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any Party from any liability for
any breach by it of this Agreement, including from any inaccuracy in its
representations and warranties and any non-performance by it of its covenants
made herein, except as expressly provided in Section 7.4.

 **9.3** Governing Law

  

This Agreement shall be governed, including as to validity, interpretation
and effect, by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada
applicable therein, and shall be construed and treated in all respects as an
Ontario contract. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Ontario in respect of

Transaction.

  

 **9.4** Injunctive Relief

  

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached for which money damages would not
be an adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive
or other equitable relief hereby being waived.

with such subsidiary for all of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement
shall be binding on and shall enure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No third party shall have any

the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Party.

  

 **9.7** Severability

  

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or

adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to

possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

  

 **9.8** Counterparts

  

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

primary obligor, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the
prompt payment and performance of all of the obligations of Purchaser under
and pursuant to the foregoing Arrangement Agreement, and this guarantee by
the undersigned shall be an obligation for full and prompt payment, rather

shall diminish, release or discharge the liability of the undersigned under
the foregoing Arrangement Agreement. The liability of the undersigned under
this guarantee is continuing and shall only be discharged by the full
performance by Purchaser of all of its obligations under the foregoing
Arrangement Agreement. The undersigned has the capacity and authority to
execute and deliver this guarantee and to perform hereunder, without the
necessity of any act or consent of any other person whomsoever. The
execution, delivery and performance of this guarantee has been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the undersigned.
This guarantee constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
the undersigned, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except
as enforceability may be limited by applicable equitable principles, or
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws from
time to time in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally.

 **ARTICLE 3 
 THE ARRANGEMENT**

  

 **3.1** Arrangement

  

Pursuant to the Arrangement, the following transactions shall occur and shall
be deemed to occur at the Effective Time (unless otherwise specified), in the
following order:

  

(a) Purchaser (or one of its Affiliates) will provide **(i) one or more
loans (the "** **Royal Third Party Debt Payoff Loans** **") to Royal in the
aggregate amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts owing under the
Specified Third Party Debt;** **** (ii) a loan to Royal equal to
the aggregate amount payable by Royal under section 3.1(d) (the " **Royal
Option Loan** "); and (iii) a loan to Royal equal to the aggregate amount
payable by Royal under section 3.1(e) (the " **RSU Payment Loan** "). The
Royal Third Party Debt Payoff Loans, the Royal Option Loan and the RSU
Payment Loan will be evidenced by demand promissory notes issued by Royal to
Purchaser (or the applicable Affiliate of Purchaser);

  

(b) immediately upon receipt of the Royal Third Party Debt Payoff Loans,
Royal will repay in full all amounts owing under the Specified Third Party
Debt;

  

(c) two minutes after the completion of the immediately preceding step, each
Royal Share, other than a Royal Share held by a Dissenting Shareholder, will
be acquired by Purchaser without any further authorization, act or formality,
in exchange for a cash payment by Purchaser equal to the Purchase Price, less
any required withholding taxes, and the Purchaser will be deemed to be the
legal and beneficial owner thereof, free and clear of all liens, charges,
claims and encumbrances. The names of the holders of the Royal Shares
transferred to Purchaser shall be removed from the applicable registers of
holders of Royal Shares and Purchaser shall be recorded as the registered
holder of the Royal Shares so acquired and shall be deemed the legal and
beneficial owner thereof;

     

   

(d) two minutes after the completion of the immediately preceding step, each
Royal Option issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and will be deemed to have been
disposed of to Royal in exchange for a cash payment by Royal equal to the
amount, if any, of the In-the-Money Amount of such Royal Option, less any
required withholding taxes;

  

(e) at the same time as the preceding step, each RSU issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will be
cancelled in exchange for a cash payment by Royal equal to $l per RSU, less
any required withholding taxes; and

  

(f) the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Senior Management Incentive Plan
shall be terminated.

  

 **ARTICLE 4 
 PAYMENT**

  

 **4.1** Delivery of Cash

  

(a) At or before the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Depositary, for the benefit of each Royal Shareholder, the
cash, in Canadian dollars, to which each such Royal Shareholder is entitled
pursuant to section 3.1(c) upon the transfer of Royal Shares to Purchaser.
Upon surrender by a Royal Shareholder to the Depositary of a certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more Royal
Shares, together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and
such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the holder of such surrendered certificate(s) of Royal Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Purchaser shall cause the
Depositary to deliver to such Royal Shareholder, as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, a cheque issued by the Depositary (or other form of
immediately available funds) representing that amount of cash which such
Royal Shareholder has the right to receive, less any amounts withheld
pursuant to section 4.5 and any certificate(s) of Royal Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. The cash deposited to the Depositary shall be
held in an interest-bearing account, and any interest earned on such funds
shall be for the account of Purchaser. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Royal Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
Royal, a cheque representing the proper amount of cash (or other form of
immediately available funds) may be delivered to the transferee if the
certificate representing such Royal Shares is surrendered to the Depositary,
accompanied by a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer.

  

(b) Prior to the transaction contemplated in section 3.1(d), Royal shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Depositary, for the benefit of each
holder of a Royal Option and/or RSU, an amount of cash equal to the amount of
cash each

     

   

such holder of a Royal Option and/or RSU is entitled to receive under section
3.1(d) or 3.1(e). The cash shall be held in a separate interest-bearing
account and any interest earned on such funds shall be for the account of
Royal. The Depositary shall deliver to each such holder of a Royal Option
and/or RSU, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, a cheque issued
by the Depositary (or other form of immediately available funds) representing
that amount of cash which such holder of Royal Option and/or RSU is entitled
to receive, less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.5, against receipt
of such documentation as Purchaser or Royal may reasonably require
acknowledging the transfer and/or termination of the Royal Options or RSUs,
as the case may be, held by such holder.

  

 **4.2** Distributions with respect to Unsurrendered Certificates

  

No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Royal Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Royal Shares
that were transferred pursuant to section 3.1(c), and no cash payment pursuant
to section 3.1(c) shall be paid to any such holder, unless and until the
holder of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance
with section 4.1. Subject to applicable laws, at the time of such surrender
of any such certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing Royal Shares, without interest, the amount of cash
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 3.1(c).

  

 **4.3** Lost Certificates

  

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Royal Shares that were transferred
pursuant to section 3.1(c) is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, a cheque (or other form of
immediately available funds) for the cash amount, deliverable in accordance
with such holders Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in
exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person to whom
cash is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to the payment
thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Purchaser and Royal and their respective
transfer agents in such sum as Purchaser and Royal may direct or otherwise
indemnify Purchaser and Royal in a manner satisfactory to Purchaser and Royal
against any claim that may be made against Purchaser or Royal with respect to
the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

 **4.4** Extinction of Rights

  

(a) Until surrendered as contemplated by section 4.1, each certificate of
Royal Shares shall be deemed at all times after the time of the acquisition
of such Royal Shares by Purchaser pursuant to section 3.1(c) to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender a cash payment as contemplated
by section 4.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.5.
Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Royal Shares that were transferred

     

   

pursuant to section 3.1(c), and not deposited, with all other instruments
required by section 4.1, on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or
nature as a shareholder of Royal or for the receipt of cash. On such date,
all Royal Shares to which the former holder of the certificate referred to in
the preceding sentence was entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered
to Purchaser and the cash to which the former holder of the certificate was
ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no
consideration to Purchaser, together with all entitlements to dividends,
distributions and interest thereon held for such former holder. None of
Purchaser or Royal shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

  

(b) Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary on behalf of Royal or
Purchaser that has not been deposited or has been returned to the Depositary
or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Date, shall cease to represent a right or claim
of any kind or nature and the right of the holder to receive the
consideration for Royal Options, RSUs or Royal Shares, as the case may be,
pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be
surrendered and forfeited to Royal or Purchaser, as applicable.

  

 **4.5** Withholding Rights

  

Purchaser, Royal or the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable to any Royal Securityholder pursuant to
section 3.1, such amounts as Purchaser, Royal or the Depositary determines it
is required or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment
under the Tax Act, the Code or any provision of federal, provincial,
territorial, state, local or foreign tax laws, in each case, as amended. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the Royal
Securityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made,
provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority.

  

 **ARTICLE 5 
 RIGHTS OF DISSENT**

  

 **5.1** Dissent Rights

  

(a) Royal Shareholders may exercise rights of dissent with respect to their
Royal Shares pursuant to and in the manner set forth in section 190 of the
CBCA as modified by this section 5.1 (the **"Dissent Rights"** ) **** in
connection with the Arrangement, as the same may be modified by the Interim
Order or the Final Order, provided that, (i) notwithstanding subsection
190(5) of the CBCA, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution
referred to in subsection 190(5) of the CBCA must be received by Royal not
later than 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the Business Day preceding the Royal
Meeting; and (ii) notwithstanding section 190 of the CBCA, Purchaser, and
not Royal, shall be required to offer to pay fair value for Royal Shares held
by holders who duly exercise Dissent Rights,

     

   

and to pay the amount to which such holders may be ultimately entitled.
Holders who duly exercise Dissent Rights and who are ultimately entitled to
be paid fair value for their Royal Shares, shall be deemed to have
transferred their Royal Shares, contemporaneously with the transfer of Royal
Shares pursuant to section 3.1(c), without any further authorization, act or
formality and free and clear of all liens, charges, claims and
encumbrances, to Purchaser in consideration of a payment from Purchaser equal
to such fair value at the time contemplated in section 3.1(c).

  

(b) Royal Shareholders who exercise, or purport to exercise, Dissent Rights,
and who are ultimately determined not to be entitled, for any reason, to be
paid fair value for their Royal Shares, shall be deemed to have participated
in the Arrangement on the same basis as any non-dissenting Royal Shareholder
as at and from the Effective Time and shall receive the cash on the basis set
forth in Article 3.

  

 **5.2** Holders

  

In no circumstances shall Royal, Purchaser or any other person be required to
recognize a person exercising Dissent Rights unless such person is a
registered holder of those Royal Shares in respect of which such rights are
sought to be exercised.

  

 **5.3** Recognition of Dissenting Shareholders

  

Neither Royal nor Purchaser nor any other person shall be required to
