ARTICLE I _ 

Purchase and Sale of the Securities; Closing_

 



 

SECTION 1.01. _Purchase and Sale of Securities._ On the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (as defined in
Section 1.02), each Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and deliver to

the Code (as defined in Section 3.11) or under any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law, provided that no amount shall be withheld on account of
U.S. federal income Tax with respect to a Seller provided that such Seller has

change in Applicable Law after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 1.02. _Closing Date._ The closing of the Acquisition (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, 825

forth in Section 6.02 or 6.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted, waived by the party entitled to the benefit thereof), as soon as
practicable after all the conditions set forth in Article VI have been
satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived by the parties entitled to the
benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed
between Sellers' Representative (as defined in Section 1.05) and Purchaser.
The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_ ".

 



 

SECTION 1.03. _Transactions To Be Effected at the Closing_. At the
Closing:

 



 

(a) each LRPHI Stockholder shall deliver to Purchaser (i) certificates
representing the LRPHI Stock owned by such LRPHI Stockholder, duly endorsed in
blank or accompanied by powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for

(c) each Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a properly prepared and
executed certificate of non-foreign status under Treas. Reg. §1.1445-2(b)(2)
that establishes (to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser) that no
withholding is required under Section 1445 of the Code and a properly prepared
and certified IRS Form W-9 claiming complete exemption from U.S. backup
withholding; and

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers' Representative, on behalf of
Sellers, payment, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated in writing by Sellers' Representative (such designation to
be made at least two business days prior to the Closing Date), in an amount
equal to (i) (A) the Purchase Price, minus (B) the Escrowed Funds, minus (C)
the Bonus Amount, minus (D) the Warrant Payment, plus or minus (ii) an
estimate, prepared by the Company in good faith and delivered to Purchaser at
least two business days prior to the Closing Date of any adjustment to the
Purchase Price under Section 1.04 (the Purchase Price plus or minus such
estimate of any adjustment under Section 1.04 being hereinafter called the "
_Closing Date Amount_ "); and

 



 

(e) Purchaser shall deposit $13,250,000 (together with interest earned
thereon as provided in the Escrow Agreement, the " _Escrowed Funds_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds into an escrow account (the " _Escrow
Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms and conditions of an escrow
agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") by and among Purchaser, Sellers'
Representative and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow
Agent_ "), substantially in the form and substance of Exhibit A, to be
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement; and

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to a bank account designated in writing by the Company (such designation to be
made at least two business days prior to the Closing Date), the amount, as set
forth in a written notice delivered by Sellers' Representative to Purchaser at
least two business days prior to the Closing Date, required to be paid
pursuant to the phantom equity awards listed in Section 3.03(a) of the
Disclosure Letter and any other bonuses, change of control or similar payments
permitted or consented to by Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.01 and payable by
the Company or any Subsidiary at Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Bonus Amount_ "), and the
Purchaser shall cause the Bonus Amount to be distributed to each individual
entitled to receive their applicable share of the Bonus Amount (as specified
in the written notice described above) through the payroll systems of the
Company no later than the regularly scheduled payroll date occurring on or
after the Closing Date; and

 



 

(g) Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to a bank account designated in writing by Sellers' Representative or Aritas
Group, Inc. (such designation to be made at least two business days prior to
the Closing Date), the amount (the " _Warrant Payment_ "), as set forth in a
written notice delivered by Sellers' Representative to Purchaser at least two
business days prior to the Closing Date, of the Warrant Payment (as defined in
that certain Warrant Termination Agreement between the Company and Aritas
Group, Inc., dated September 21, 2015 (the " _Warrant Termination Agreement_
")); and

 



 

 



   



 

(h) Purchaser and Sellers shall make such other deliveries as are
required by Article VI.

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment._ Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Sellers shall cause Sellers' Representative to prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Statement_ ") setting forth Adjusted
Working Capital (as defined in Section 1.04(i)), including each component
thereof, as of the close of business on the business day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (" _Closing Adjusted Working Capital_ ").

 



 

(b) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the
90th day following receipt by Purchaser thereof, unless Purchaser gives
written notice of its disagreement with the Statement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Sellers' Representative prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement
so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Sellers'
Representative in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in
accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon Sellers and
Purchaser on the earlier of (A) the date Sellers' Representative and Purchaser
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any disputed matters
are finally resolved by the Accounting Firm (as defined below). During the
30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period, Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall submit to an independent accounting firm
(the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution any and all matters that were
included by Purchaser in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in
dispute. The Accounting Firm shall be Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if such firm
is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in writing by Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).
Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall execute, if required by the
Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter, including customary
indemnities in favor of the Accounting Firm. Once appointed, the Accounting
Firm shall have no _ex parte_ communications with any of the parties hereto
concerning the determination required under this Section 1.04.

 



 

(c) Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters
submitted to it within 30 days of such submission. In resolving matters
submitted to it pursuant to Section 1.04(b), the Accounting Firm (i) shall
base its decision based solely on written submissions by Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser and their respective representatives and not by
independent review and (ii) with respect to each matter submitted to it, shall
not resolve such matter in a manner that is more favorable to Sellers'
Representative than the Statement or more favorable to Purchaser than the
Notice of Disagreement.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall
be limited to (i) whether there were mathematical errors in the Statement,
(ii) whether Closing Adjusted Working Capital has been calculated in
accordance with the Adjusted Accounting Principles and the procedures and
definitions in Schedule 1.04, and (iii) the interest calculation in accordance
with Sections 1.04(f). The payments required by Section 1.04(g) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of either party for any and all claims arising under
this Agreement with respect to the determination of the difference between
Closing Adjusted Working Capital and the Target Amount and the related
determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price; _provided_ that any disputes
about the scope of disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm pursuant to
this Section 1.04(d) shall be resolved in accordance with Section 9.09.

 



 

(e) The final determination by the Accounting Firm of the matters
submitted to it pursuant to Section 1.04(b) shall: (i) be in writing; (ii)
include the Accounting Firm's calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price;
(iii) include the Accounting Firm's determination of each matter submitted to
it pursuant to Section 1.04(b); (iv) include the Accounting Firm's calculation
of interest (in accordance with Section 1.04(f)) from and including the
Closing Date to but excluding the date of determination; and (v) include a
brief summary of the Accounting Firm's reasons for its determination of each
issue.

 



 

(f) The dispute resolution by the Accounting Firm under this Section 1.04
shall constitute an expert determination under New York CPLR Article 76 and
shall not constitute an arbitration. The determinations of the Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding, absent fraud, bad faith or manifest error.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in New
York State Supreme Court or any other court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. During the engagement of
the Accounting Firm, the Accounting Firm will bill 50% of the total charges to
each of Purchaser and Sellers' Representative (on behalf of Sellers);
_provided_ that the cost of any dispute resolution (including the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm) pursuant to this Section 1.04 shall be borne
by Sellers and Purchaser based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to such party bears to the actual amount
contested by such party, which allocations shall also be determined by the
Accounting Firm (taking into account all fees and expenses already paid by
Sellers and Purchaser) at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. For example, if Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of Sellers) claims Closing Adjusted Working Capital
is $1,000 more than the amount determined by Purchaser, and Purchaser contests
only $500 of the amount claimed by Sellers' Representative, and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Sellers $300 of
the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to
Sellers. Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall pay to the other party,
as applicable, any difference between the amount of costs finally determined
by the Accounting Firm to be payable by such party and the amount previously
paid by such party to the date of such determination.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which Closing
Adjusted Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.04,
exceeds the Target Amount, and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
amount by which Closing Adjusted Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 1.04, is less than the Target Amount (the Purchase
Price as so increased or decreased shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Adjusted Purchase Price_ "). If the Closing Date Amount is less than the
Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall, and if the Closing Date Amount is
more than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Sellers shall, within 10 business days
after the calculation of Closing Adjusted Working Capital becomes final and
binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer in immediately available
funds of the amount of such difference (in the case of each Seller, the amount
payable by each Seller pursuant to this Section 1.04(g) shall be in proportion
to the percentage set forth opposite such Seller's name on Schedule
8.01(a)(i)), together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
its prime rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
divided by 365, from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date
of payment.

 



 

(h) In connection with the determination of Closing Adjusted Working
Capital pursuant to this Section 1.04, from the Closing Date through the
resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this
Section 1.04, Purchaser shall afford, and shall cause the Company and each
Subsidiary to afford, to Sellers' Representative and its independent
accountants and other representatives reasonable access to the personnel
(including outside accountants), properties, books and records of the Company
and the Subsidiaries for any purpose reasonably related to the adjustment
contemplated by this Section 1.04.

 



 

(i) In this Agreement:

 



 

" _Adjusted Accounting Principles_ " means (i) the principles, policies and
procedures set forth in Schedule 1.04, including the example calculation set
forth therein, (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing clause
(i), GAAP, and (iii) to the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing clause
(i) or (ii), the principles, policies, procedures, categorizations,
assumptions, techniques and estimation methods with respect to financial
statements, their classification or presentation or otherwise (including with
respect to the nature of accounts, level of reserves or level of accruals)
adopted in connection with the Audited Financial Statements. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Adjusted Accounting Principles shall not include any changes in
assets or liabilities as a result of purchase price accounting adjustments or
other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

" _Adjusted Working Capital_ " means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities.
The terms " _Current Assets_ " and " _Current Liabilities_ " mean the current
assets and current liabilities, respectively, of the Company and the
Subsidiaries in the categories described on Schedule 1.04 and subject only to
adjustment in accordance with Schedule 1.04 and calculated on a consolidated
basis in accordance with the Adjusted Accounting Principles.

 



 

 



   



 

" _Target Amount_ " means $0.00.

 



 

SECTION 1.05. _Relationship Among Sellers_. Each Seller hereby appoints
David L Haselkorn, PC as the sole representative (" _Sellers '
Representative_") of such Seller to act as the agent and on behalf of such
Seller for all purposes under this Agreement, including for the purposes of:

Warrant Payment and the Bonus Amount and applicable withholding taxes that are

delivery of wire instructions to Purchaser in connection therewith, as
provided in Section 1.03; (ii) determining the Closing Date Amount and
delivery of the Statement; (iii) review of any Notice of Disagreement; (iv)

necessary or desirable, as determined by Sellers' Representative in its sole
discretion, in connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance

Section 9.03; (ix) taking any and all actions that may be necessary or
desirable, as determined by Sellers' Representative in its sole discretion, in
connection with the payment of the costs and expenses incurred with respect to
the Company or such Seller in accordance with Section 5.06; (x) delivering or
causing to be delivered to Purchaser at the Closing certificates representing
the Securities to be sold by such Seller hereunder; (xi) executing and

such Seller, any and all notices, documents or certificates to be executed by

(c) _Consultation._ In connection with the continuing operation of the
business of LRPHI, and of the Company and the Subsidiaries between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult in good faith on a regular and frequent basis with the
representatives for Purchaser to report material operational developments and
the general status of ongoing operations pursuant to procedures reasonably
requested by Purchaser or such representatives. Sellers acknowledge that any
such consultation shall not constitute a waiver by Purchaser of any rights it
may have under this Agreement, and that Purchaser shall not have any liability
or responsibility for any actions of the Company, any Subsidiary, any Seller
or any of their respective officers or directors with respect to matters that
are the subject of such consultations unless Purchaser expressly consents to
such action in writing.

 



 

SECTION 5.02. _No Solicitation._ None of Sellers shall, nor shall any
Seller authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of or any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it
or the Company to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any "other bid", (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any other bid or (iii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or encourage any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any other
bid. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any executive officer
of any Seller or the Company, as applicable, or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of any Seller or the Company, that
is authorized by such Seller or the Company to act on behalf of such Seller or
the Company, as applicable, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
5.02 by such Seller. Each Seller and the Company promptly shall advise
Purchaser orally and in writing of any other bid or any inquiry with respect
to or which could lead to any other bid and the material details thereof
(other than the identity of the other party). As used in this Section 5.02, "
_other bid_ " shall mean any proposal for a merger, sale of securities, sale
of substantial assets or similar transaction involving the Company or any
Subsidiary, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.03. _Access to Information._ The Company shall, and shall
cause the Subsidiaries to, afford to Purchaser and its accountants, counsel
and other representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing, to all
the personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments, Tax Returns and
records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and, during such period shall
furnish promptly to Purchaser any information concerning the Company or a
Subsidiary as Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company or
the Subsidiaries and all requests for access shall be directed to Sellers'
Representative or such other person as Sellers may designate in writing from
time to time. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither Sellers
nor the Company make any representation or warranty as to any information (if
any) provided pursuant to this Section 5.03. The information provided pursuant
to this Section 5.03 will be governed by the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 5.04. _Confidentiality._ Purchaser acknowledges that the
information being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition and the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the
terms of a confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate.

 



 

(b) Each Seller shall keep confidential, and cause its affiliates and
its and their officers, directors, employees and advisors to keep
confidential, all information relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries,
except (i) as required by law or administrative process, (ii) for information
that is available to the public on the Closing Date or thereafter becomes
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Section
5.04(b), or (iii) for information developed by a Seller independently and
without reference to any confidential information. From and after the Closing
Date, the provisions of this Section 5.04 shall not apply to or restrict the
use of confidential information of the Company or a Subsidiary by a Seller in
connection with the provision of services to the Company or any of its
affiliates. If a Seller becomes compelled in any Proceeding (other than a
Proceeding between or among the parties hereto) or is requested by a
Governmental Entity having regulatory jurisdiction over the transactions
contemplated hereby to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise
constrained by this Section 5.04, such Seller shall, to the extent
practicable, provide Purchaser with notice of such compulsion or request so
that it may (at the expense of the party seeking protection) seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance
with the provisions of this Section 5.04. In the absence of a protective order
or other remedy, a Seller may disclose that portion of the confidential
information that such party is legally required to disclose. The covenant set
forth in this Section 5.04(b) shall terminate three years after the Closing
Date.

 



 

SECTION 5.05. _Regulatory Filings; Consents; Reasonable Best Efforts._
On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur at the earliest
practicable date.

 



 

(b) The Company shall as promptly as practicable file with FINRA the
filing required for the transactions contemplated hereby, and Purchaser shall
furnish to the Company such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the Company may request in connection with its preparation of such filing.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and to cooperate in
obtaining, all consents (including any consents under any Leased Real Property
lease) from third parties necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation
of the Acquisition.

 



 

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date, except with the
consent of Sellers (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), Purchaser and its affiliates shall not enter into any
acquisition, merger or other similar transaction (i) pursuant to which
Purchaser will purchase or otherwise acquire any entity or business that is
substantially in competition with the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries and (ii) that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Closing because of an investigation by a Governmental
Entity under the Applicable Laws related to antitrust matters.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 5.06. _Expenses; Transfer Taxes._ Whether or not the Closing
takes place, and except as set forth in Article VIII, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to
Section 5.05.

 



 

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, value-added and
other similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") applicable to the transfer of each
Security shall be borne 50% by each Seller that transferred such Security, on
the one hand, and 50% by Purchaser, on the other hand. Each party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions
from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the other parties in
providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain
such exemptions.

 



 

SECTION 5.07. _Brokers or Finders._ Each of Purchaser and each Seller
represents, as to itself and its affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment
banker or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any broker's or
finder's fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, as to Sellers,
Broadhaven Capital Partners, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Sellers.

 



 

SECTION 5.08. _Employee Matters._ The parties acknowledge and agree to
the matters set forth on Schedule 5.08.

 



 

SECTION 5.09. _Tax Matters._ Sellers' Representative shall prepare or
cause to be prepared all Tax Returns (including Schedule K1s) required to be
filed with a Taxing Authority (or, in the case of any Schedule K1, delivered
to the applicable equity interest holder) by or with respect to each of the
Company, the Subsidiaries and LRPHI for any Tax period of each such entity
ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ "). The
Pre-Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent with
past practice, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or agreed by the
parties in writing.

 



 

(i) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required to be
filed (or delivered, as applicable) before the Closing Date, Sellers'
Representative shall (x) timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Return with
the relevant Taxing Authority (or deliver or cause to be delivered such Tax
Return to the applicable equity interest holder, as applicable) and (y) timely
pay or cause to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority the amount shown as
due on such Tax Return.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) In the case of any Pre-Closing Tax Return with respect to an income
or franchise Tax (including any partnership Tax Return) (an " _Income Tax
Return_ ") that is required to be filed (or delivered, as applicable) after
the Closing Date:

 



 

(1) Sellers' Representative shall present each such Tax Return to
Purchaser for review and comment at least 30 days before the due date of such
Tax Return (taking into account extensions). If Purchaser does not object to
such Tax Return within 20 days after receipt thereof, then Purchaser shall be
deemed to have accepted such Tax Return and Purchaser shall timely file or
cause to be filed such Tax Return with the relevant Taxing Authority (or
deliver or cause to be delivered such Tax Return to the applicable equity
interest holder, as applicable) in such accepted form. If Purchaser delivers
an objection to Sellers' Representative with respect to such Tax Return within
20 days after receipt thereof, then Purchaser and Sellers' Representative
shall act reasonably and in good faith to resolve such objection and (x) if
Purchaser and Sellers' Representative resolve such dispute at least five
business days before the due date of such Tax Return (taking into account
extensions), Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Return
with the relevant Taxing Authority (or deliver or cause to be delivered such
Tax Return to the applicable equity interest holder, as applicable) in the
agreed-upon form or (y) if Purchaser and Sellers' Representative do not
resolve such dispute at least five business days before the due date of such
Tax Return (taking into account extensions), then Purchaser shall file or
cause to be filed with the relevant Taxing Authority (or deliver or cause to
be delivered to the applicable equity interest holder, as applicable) such Tax
Return in the form provided by Sellers' Representative, except that Purchaser
shall have the right to adjust such Tax Return to the extent necessary
(determined in Purchaser's sole reasonable discretion) to avoid exposing
Purchaser and its affiliates to criminal penalties or non-monetary sanctions.

 



 

(2) Sellers shall pay to Sellers' Representative, at least five business
days before the due date of such Tax Return (taking into account extensions),
the amount shown as due on such Tax Return reduced to the extent such amount
was taken into account in the calculation of Closing Adjusted Working Capital.
Each Seller's liability for such amount shall be determined in the same manner
as such Seller's indemnification obligations under Section 8.01(e) and Section
8.01(f). Sellers' Representative shall promptly pay to Purchaser all amounts
received from Sellers under this Section 5.09(a)(ii)(2).

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause to be filed (or
deliver or cause to be delivered, as applicable) all Tax Returns (including
Schedule K1s) required to be filed (or delivered, as applicable) by or with
respect to each of the Company, the Subsidiaries and LRPHI for any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ ") and all Pre-Closing Tax Returns required to be filed after the
Closing Date that are not Income Tax Returns; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
with respect to each such Tax Return, to the extent relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner that is
consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law
or agreed by the parties in writing. Purchaser shall present the portion of
each such Tax Return related to any Pre-Closing Tax Period to Sellers'
Representative for review and comment at least 30 days before the due date of
such Tax Return (taking into account extensions). If Sellers' Representative
does not object to such Tax Return within 20 days after receipt thereof, then
Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to have accepted such Tax Return and
Purchaser shall timely file or cause to be filed such Tax Return with the
relevant Taxing Authority (or deliver or cause to be delivered such Tax Return
to the applicable equity interest holder) in such accepted form. If Sellers'
Representative delivers an objection to Purchaser with respect to such Tax
Return within 20 days after receipt thereof, then Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative shall act reasonably and in good faith to resolve such
objection and (i) if Purchaser and Sellers' Representative resolve such
dispute at least five business days before the due date of such Tax Return
(taking into account extensions), then Purchaser shall timely file or cause to
be filed such Tax Return with the relevant Taxing Authority (or deliver or
cause to be delivered such Tax Return to the applicable equity interest
holder) in the agreed-upon form or (ii) if Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative do not resolve such dispute at least five business days before
the due date of such Tax Return (taking into account extensions), then
Purchaser shall adjust the portion of such Tax Return related to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period to reflect Sellers' Representative's objections, except that
Purchaser shall have the right to further adjust such adjusted Tax Return to
the extent necessary (determined in Purchaser's sole reasonable discretion) to
avoid exposing Purchaser and its affiliates to criminal penalties or non-
monetary sanctions, and shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Return with
the relevant Taxing Authority (or deliver or cause to be delivered such Tax
Return to the applicable equity interest holder) as so adjusted. Sellers shall
pay to Sellers' Representative, at least five business days before the due
date of such Tax Return (taking into account extensions), any amount owed by
each Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(e) and Section 8.01(f) with respect to
the taxable period covered by such Tax Return. Sellers' Representative shall
promptly pay to Purchaser all amounts received from Sellers under this Section
5.09(b).

 



 

(c) Any refund or credit of Taxes paid by or with respect to the
Company, any Subsidiary or LRPHI before the Closing (including by way of an
offset against Taxes in a tax period that is not a Pre-Closing Tax Period) or
pursuant to an indemnity claim under Section 8.01(e) and Section 8.01(f) shall
belong to Sellers (or the LRPHI Stockholders in the case of a refund or credit
of Taxes paid by or with respect to LRPHI), except to the extent such refund
or credit was taken into account in the calculation of Closing Adjusted
Working Capital. All other refunds or credits of Taxes paid by or with respect
to the Company, any Subsidiary or LRPHI shall belong to Purchaser. Purchaser,
on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall, or shall cause their
respective affiliates to, pay to Sellers' Representative the portion of any
such refund, credit or offset of Taxes to which Sellers or Purchaser,
respectively, is entitled under this Section 5.09(c), (i) in the case of a
refund, within 10 business days after receipt thereof or (ii) in the case of a
credit or offset, within 10 business days after such credit is allowed or
applied against any other Tax liability. Sellers' Representative shall
promptly pay any such amounts to Sellers (or the LRPHI Stockholders, as
applicable) or Purchaser, as applicable. If any portion of a refund or credit
is subsequently disallowed by any Taxing Authority, then amounts previously
paid hereunder in respect thereof shall be promptly reimbursed by the payee to
the payor.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) The Company, each Subsidiary, Sellers and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees,
contractors, consultants, agents, auditors and representatives to reasonably
cooperate, in preparing and filing (or delivering, as applicable) all Tax
Returns, including by maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

 



 

(e) All Tax sharing agreements, arrangements and practices between the
Company, any Subsidiary or LRPHI, on the one hand, and Sellers or any
affiliate of Sellers, on the other hand, shall be terminated before the
Closing. After the Closing, none of the Company, the Subsidiaries, LRPHI,
Sellers nor any affiliate of any Seller shall have any rights or obligations
under any such Tax sharing agreement, arrangement or practice.

 



 

(f) No later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
deliver to Sellers' Representative a statement allocating the purchase price
attributable to the purchase of the Membership Interests from the Individual
Sellers and any assumed liabilities associated with such purchased Membership
Interests (as determined under applicable income Tax principles) among the
assets of the Company and each Subsidiary that is treated as a "flowthrough"
for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations, _provided_ that, to the extent consistent therewith, the amount
allocated to property, plant and equipment and current assets (in each case,
other than customer contracts and software) shall not exceed the tax basis of
such assets. Sellers' Representative shall deliver written notice to Purchaser
within 30 days after Sellers' Representative's receipt of the Allocation
Statement either accepting or objecting to the Allocation Statement, and, if
Sellers' Representative shall not have delivered such written notice within
such 30-day period, Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to have agreed to
the Allocation Statement (and the Allocation Statement shall become a final
allocation). If Sellers' Representative objects to the Allocation Statement in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative shall attempt to resolve their differences by good
faith negotiation to agree on a final allocation. If Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative are unable to agree on a final allocation within 30 days after
the delivery of Sellers' Representative's objection to the Allocation
Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then
Purchaser and Sellers' Representative shall collectively select an arbiter
from an internationally recognized public accounting firm (the person so
selected shall be referred to herein as the " _Tax Matters Accounting Firm_
"). The parties shall instruct the Tax Matters Accounting Firm to use its best
efforts to determine a final allocation as promptly as possible and not later
than 20 days after submission of the matter to the Tax Matters Accounting
Firm. Only disputed item(s) relating to the Allocation Statement shall be
submitted to the Tax Matters Accounting Firm for review. In resolving any
disputed item, the parties shall instruct the Tax Matters Accounting Firm that
it may not assign a fair market value to such item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Sellers' Representative or
less than the lowest fair market value for such item claimed by either
Purchaser or Sellers' Representative, in each case, as presented to the Tax
Matters Accounting Firm. All determinations of the Tax Matters Accounting Firm
relating to the disputed items, absent fraud, shall be final and binding on
the parties and shall produce a final allocation. The fees and expenses of the
Tax Matters Accounting Firm shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by
Sellers' Representative. Any final allocation agreed or otherwise determined
pursuant to this Section 5.09(f) shall be the " _Final Allocation_ " for
purposes of this Agreement. The parties shall cooperate to adjust the Final
Allocation to reflect any adjustments made to the Purchase Price, including
pursuant to Section 1.04. The Final Allocation shall be final and binding upon
the parties for all Tax purposes and, except as required by Applicable Law or
as mutually agreed to in writing by Sellers' Representative and Purchaser, the
parties agree to act in accordance with the Final Allocation for all Tax
purposes.

 



 

 



   



 

(g) Sellers agree that, with respect to the Company and each Subsidiary
that is treated as a partnership for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, either
(i) a valid election under Section 754 (a " _Section 754 Election_ ") is, as
of the date hereof, and will be, as of the Closing Date, in effect or (ii) a
Section 754 Election shall be made in a timely manner such that the election
applies to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(h) The Company, any Subsidiary, LRPHI, any Seller or Sellers'
Representative shall promptly notify Purchaser of any Proceeding or audit
pending prior to the Closing Date against or with respect to the Company, any
of the Subsidiaries or LRPHI in respect of any Tax or Tax Return.

 



 

(i) The parties hereto agree to treat the sale of the Membership
Interests by the Individual Sellers to Purchaser, for all U.S. Federal income
Tax purposes, as a termination of the Company as a partnership, upon which the
Company is deemed to contribute all of its assets and liabilities to a new
partnership in exchange for an interest in the new partnership; and,
immediately thereafter, the Company is deemed to distribute interests in the
new partnership to Purchaser and LRPHI in proportion to their respective
interests in the Company in liquidation of the Company in accordance with U.S.
Treasury Regulation Section 1.708-1(b)(4), and shall take no position
inconsistent therewith.

 



 

(j) Purchaser agrees that any assignment of its rights to acquire the
LRPHI Stock pursuant to Section 9.01 shall be to an entity that is itself
treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes or that
is owned directly (or indirectly through a chain of one or more entities that
are disregarded for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes) by an entity that is
treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes.
Purchaser will not make any elections pursuant to Section 336(e) or 338(h)(10)
of the Code (or any corresponding provision of U.S. state or local law) with
respect to the acquisition of the LRPHI Stock.

 



 

(k) Each amount paid to Purchaser or to Sellers pursuant to this Section
5.09 and each amount paid to an indemnitee pursuant to Article VIII shall be
treated as an adjustment to the aggregate Purchase Price for all Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 5.10. _Publicity._ No public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or
the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange,
in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall
allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.

 



 

SECTION 5.11. _Agreement Not To Compete._ Each Individual Seller
understands that Purchaser shall be entitled to protect and preserve the going
concern value of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries to the
extent permitted by law and that Purchaser would not have entered into this
Agreement absent the provisions of this Section 5.11 and, therefore, for a
period of three years from the Closing, each Individual Seller shall not, and
shall cause each of its affiliates not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) engage in activities or businesses, or establish any new
businesses, within North America that are substantially in competition with
the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date ("
_Competitive Activities_ "), including (A) selling goods or services of the
type sold by the Company or any Subsidiary (other than on behalf of the
Company or its affiliates), except that if any goods or services were not sold
by the Company or any Subsidiary during the period of time prior to the
Closing and are not sold by the Company and the Subsidiaries at the time of
the Closing (collectively, " _Permitted Goods and Services_ "), any Individual
Seller may sell any Permitted Goods and Services, (B) soliciting any customer
or prospective customer of the Company or any Subsidiary to purchase any goods
or services sold by the Company or any Subsidiary, other than Permitted Goods
and Services, from anyone other than Purchaser and its affiliates, and (C)
assisting any person in any way to do, or attempt to do, anything prohibited
by clause (A) or (B) above;

 



 

(ii) (A) solicit, recruit or hire any employee of the Company and the
Subsidiaries or (B) solicit or encourage any employee of the Company and the
Subsidiaries to leave the employment of the Company and the Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) shall not apply to (x) the
employment of any employee of the Company and the Subsidiaries if such
employee's employment has been involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or any of
its affiliates or (y) a general advertisement or solicitation program
(including through search firms) that is not specifically targeted at such
employees; and

 



 

 



   



 

(iii) whether in writing or orally, criticize, denigrate or disparage
Purchaser, the Company, any of their respective affiliates or any of the
officers, directors or employees of any of the foregoing, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any statement that is
intended or reasonably expected to become widely disseminated; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this provision shall not prevent any Individual Seller from
testifying truthfully in any legal or administrative proceeding that arises
from or relates to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein, or in
which such testimony is compelled or requested or otherwise complying with any
legal requirements or responding to inquiries or requests for information by
any regulator or auditor.

 



 

(b) Section 5.11(a) shall be deemed not breached as a result of the
ownership by any Individual Seller or any of its affiliates of less than an
aggregate of 5% of any class of stock of a person engaged, directly or
indirectly, in Competitive Activities.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is
understood and agreed that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to
Article VIII and other remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any
breach of the covenants contained in Section 5.11(a). Purchaser shall be
entitled to seek equitable relief, including the remedy of specific
performance, with respect to any breach or attempted breach of such covenants.

 



 

SECTION 5.12. _Further Assurances._ From time to time, as and when
requested by any party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to Section
5.05), as such other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, in the
case of Sellers, executing and delivering to Purchaser such assignments,
deeds, bills of sale, consents and other instruments as Purchaser or its
counsel may reasonably request as necessary or desirable for such purpose.

 



 

SECTION 5.13. _Post-Closing Access to Sellers._ From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause LRPHI, the Company and the
Subsidiaries to, (a) retain until the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations all Tax Returns and other Tax records of LRPHI, the Company and
the Subsidiaries with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing
Date and (b) to make the same available after the Closing for inspection and
copying by Sellers' Representative or its accountants, counsel and other
representatives, upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours, as
Sellers' Representative may reasonably request; _provided_ , that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company or
the Subsidiaries.

 



 

SECTION 5.14. _Director and Officer Insurance._ Prior to or
simultaneously with the Closing, Sellers shall, or shall cause the Company
(subject to the proviso at the end of this sentence, one-half at Purchaser's
expense and one-half at Sellers' expense), to purchase from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance
a prepaid insurance policy (i.e., "tail coverage") which provides "directors
and officers" insurance coverage for each of the individuals who were
officers, directors or similar functionaries of the Company or any Subsidiary
at or prior to the Closing on no less favorable terms (including in amount and
scope) as the policy or policies maintained by the Company or the Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing for the benefit of such individuals for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising
from acts, events or omissions that occurred at or prior to the Closing,
including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(such policy, the " _D andO Tail Policy_"); _provided_ that Purchaser shall not
be required to pay in excess of $25,000 of the premium for such "tail
coverage" insurance policy. From and for a period of six years following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, maintain the
DandO Tail Policy in full force and effect. The provisions of this Section 5.14
are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by (as express third-
party beneficiaries), each current and former officer, director or similar
functionary of the Company and the Subsidiaries and his or her heirs and
representatives, successors and assigns and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have had by contract or otherwise.

ARTICLE VII _ 

Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior

(i) by mutual written consent of Sellers' Representative and Purchaser;

Sections 6.01 or 6.03 shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall
not have been waived by Sellers' Representative;

 



 

(iii) by Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 or
6.02 shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been
waived by Purchaser; or

 



 

(iv) by Sellers' Representative or Purchaser, if the Closing does not

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

ARTICLE VIII _ 

Indemnification_

 



 

SECTION 8.01. _Indemnification by Sellers._ From and after the Closing,
each Seller shall be liable for, and shall indemnify Purchaser, its affiliates
(including the Company, the Subsidiaries and LRPHI) and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") against and hold each of
them harmless from, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense including
reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ "), suffered or
incurred by such Purchaser Indemnitee (other than any Loss relating to Taxes
under Sections 3.11, 5.01(a)(xiv), 5.06(b) and 5.09 for which indemnification
provisions are set forth in Sections 8.01(e) and 8.01(f) in lieu of those in
this Section 8.01(a) unless expressly provided otherwise in such Sections) to
the extent arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of (A) such Seller or
(B) the Company contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 6.02(c) (it being agreed and acknowledged by the parties
that for purposes of the right to indemnification pursuant to this clause (i)
the representations and warranties of Sellers and the Company contained herein
shall not be deemed qualified by any references herein to materiality
generally or to whether or not any such breach results or may result in a
Seller Material Adverse Effect, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a LRPHI
Material Adverse Effect); and

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant (A) in Section 5.01(a) by the Company or
LRPHI or (B) in this Agreement by such Seller requiring performance after
Closing; and

 



 

(iii) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by (A)
Sellers or (B) the Company (x) that were incurred on or prior to the Closing
in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including any fees, expenses or other payments
to any brokers, financial advisors, legal advisors or comparable other persons
retained or employed by Sellers or the Company (prior to Closing) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and that were
not reflected on the Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.04(a), or (y)
under the Warrant Termination Agreement in excess of the Warrant Payment.

 



 

Each Seller's obligations under this Section 8.01(a), Section 8.01(e) and
Section 8.01(f) shall be (x) several, and not joint with the other Sellers,
with respect to its own representations and warranties and its own covenants
and (y) several, and not joint with the other Sellers, with respect to Section
8.01(a)(iii)(B) and to the representations, warranties and covenants of the
Company in proportion to the percentage set forth opposite its name on
Schedule 8.01(a)(i), in each case, subject to the next sentence. Any
obligation under this Section 8.01(a), Section 8.01(e) or Section 8.01(f) with
respect to any representation or warranty of or regarding LRPHI or any
covenant to be performed by LRPHI (x) shall be the several, and not joint,
obligation of each LRPHI Stockholder in proportion to the percentage set forth
opposite its name on Schedule 8.01(a)(ii) and (y) shall not be an obligation
of any Seller that is not an LRPHI Stockholder.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee,
and shall not have any liability:

 



 

(i) under Section 8.01(a)(i) unless the aggregate of all Losses for
which Sellers would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds on
a cumulative basis an amount equal to 1.0% of the Adjusted Purchase Price (the
" _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent of such excess; _provided_ that
this clause (i) shall not apply to any claim for indemnification arising out
of a breach of Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.04, 2.07, 2.08(a)-(c), 2.08(e), 3.01,
3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 3.20 or 5.07 (the " _Fundamental Representations_ ").

 



 

(ii) under Section 8.01(a)(i) for any individual items or series of
related items where the Loss relating thereto is less than $75,000 (it being
understood that any such individual items or series of related items for
amounts less than $75,000 shall be ignored in determining whether the
Deductible has been exceeded); _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (ii)
shall not apply to any claim for indemnification arising out of a breach of
the Fundamental Representations; and

 



 

(iii) under Section 8.01(a)(i) in excess of $13,250,000 in the aggregate,
except that this clause (iii) shall not apply to any indemnification arising
out of (A) a willful breach of a covenant by the Company or (B) a breach of
the Fundamental Representations;

 



 

(iv) except in the case of fraud, no Losses shall be recoverable by the
Purchaser Indemnitees under Section 8.01(a)(i) from any Seller in excess of
the portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price actually received by such Seller
pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(v) except to the extent actually paid to an unrelated third party as a
result of a final, non-appealable determination in respect of a Third Party
Claim, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under this
Agreement in respect of punitive or exemplary damages.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement
(including Section 1.04), Purchaser acknowledges that its sole and exclusive
monetary remedy after the Closing with respect to any and all claims relating
to this Agreement, the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company or any Subsidiary and its assets and liabilities (other
than (x) pursuant to the terms of any employment agreement executed in
connection with this Agreement (each, an " _Employment Agreement_ ")) or (y)
claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of Purchaser and the Company hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) for damages it may have against any Seller arising under
or based upon this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith (other than any Employment Agreement), any Applicable Law
(including any relating to environmental matters), common law or otherwise
(except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Section
8.01).

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Any indemnification owed by any Seller to the Purchaser Indemnitees
pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(i), Section 8.01(a)(ii)(A) or Section
8.01(a)(iii)(B) shall be satisfied first from the remaining Escrowed Funds.
For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article VIII, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover and shall
have direct recourse to Sellers at any time in which there are insufficient
funds remaining in the Escrow Account (net of amounts reserved for pending
claims) to satisfy any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section
8.01(a)(i), Section 8.01(a)(ii)(A) or Section 8.01(a)(iii)(B) (or in the case
of fraud). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Article VIII
and the Escrow Agreement, the Escrowed Funds shall be available to compensate
Purchaser (on behalf of itself or any other Purchaser Indemnitee) for
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to the indemnification obligations of Sellers
set forth herein. If Purchaser (or any other Purchaser Indemnitee) is so
entitled to indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII, then Purchaser and
Sellers' Representative shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent in the manner
specified in the Escrow Agreement to release to Purchaser available Escrowed
Funds in an amount equal to Purchaser's (or such other Purchaser Indemnitee's)
indemnifiable Losses (or if the available Escrowed Funds are less than such
Losses, all remaining available Escrowed Funds). If, on the date that is
twelve months after the Closing Date, any Escrowed Funds remain in the Escrow
Account, Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall jointly direct the Escrow
Agent to distribute to Sellers' Representative the amount of such remaining
Escrowed Funds less the sum of (i) an amount equal to the aggregate dollar
amount of any claims any Purchaser Indemnitee may have under this Article VIII
as to which Purchaser has delivered notice to Sellers' Representative and the
Escrow Agent in the manner specified in the Escrow Agreement and (ii) an
amount determined in good faith by Purchaser in consultation with Sellers'
Representative that is estimated to be sufficient to satisfy the
indemnification obligations of Sellers with respect to any claim any Purchaser
Indemnitee may have under this Article VIII as to which Purchaser has
delivered notice to Sellers' Representative and the Escrow Agent in the manner
specified in the Escrow Agreement and with respect to which Purchaser is
unable to specify the amount of Losses.

 



 

(e) From and after the Closing, each Seller shall be severally, and not
jointly with the other Sellers, in proportion to the percentage set forth
opposite his or its name on Schedule 8.01(a)(i), liable for, and shall
indemnify each Purchaser Indemnitee against and hold it harmless from any Loss
suffered or incurred by any such Purchaser Indemnitee to the extent arising
from, relating to or otherwise in respect of:

 



 

(i) Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period;

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Taxes of any person other than the Company and the Subsidiaries for
which any such entity becomes liable (x) as a result of, before the Closing
Date, being or having been part of any consolidated, combined, affiliated,
aggregate, unitary or similar group or Tax Return, (y) as a transferee or
successor, to the extent such Taxes described in this sub clause (y) relate to
an event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date or (z) by Tax
Contract entered into prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) Taxes resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty
of the Company contained in Section 3.11 (it being agreed and acknowledged by
the parties that for purposes of the right to indemnification pursuant to this
clause (iii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.11
shall not be deemed qualified by any references therein to materiality
generally or to whether or not any such breach results or may result in a
Seller Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect), and that
any Loss shall be limited to Taxes for Pre-Closing Periods;

 



 

(iv) Taxes resulting from any breach of any covenant of such Seller or,
as of the Closing Date, the Company contained in this Agreement;

 



 

(v) Transfer Taxes that are attributable to the Securities transferred
by such Seller that are the liability of such Seller pursuant to Section
5.06(b); and

 



 

(vi) all Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) of each Seller.

the percentage set forth opposite its name on Schedule 8.01(a)(ii), liable
for, and shall indemnify each Purchaser Indemnitee against and hold it
harmless from any Loss suffered or incurred by any such Purchaser Indemnitee
to the extent arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of:

 



 

(i) Taxes of LRPHI for any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

 



 

(ii) Taxes of any person other than LRPHI for which LRPHI becomes liable
(x) as a result of, before the Closing Date, being or having been part of any
consolidated, combined, affiliated, aggregate, unitary or similar group or Tax
Return, (y) as a transferee or successor, to the extent such Taxes described
in this subclause (y) relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing Date or (z) by Tax Contract entered into prior to the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) Taxes resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty
of LRPHI contained in Section 3.11 (it being agreed and acknowledged by the
parties that for purposes of the right to indemnification pursuant to this
clause (iii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.11
shall not be deemed qualified by any references therein to materiality
generally or to whether or not any such breach results or may result in a
Seller Material Adverse Effect, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a LRPHI
Material Adverse Effect), and that any Loss shall be limited to Taxes for Pre-
Closing Periods;

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) Taxes resulting from any breach of any covenant of LRPHI or the
LRPHI Stockholders; and

 



 

(v) Transfer Taxes that are attributable to the transfer of the LRPHI
Stock that are the liability of such Seller pursuant to Section 5.06(b).

 



 

(g) In the case of any Straddle Period: (A) Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis (such as real, personal and intangible property Taxes) for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; (B)
Taxes (other than Taxes described in Section 8.01(g)(A)) for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be computed (1) as if such taxable period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date and (2) in the case of any such Taxes
attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in a partnership or other
"flowthrough" entity as if the taxable period of that entity ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for
all purposes of this Agreement, any deduction attributable to the payment of
all fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal
counsel, investment bankers, brokers or other representatives and consultants;
appraisal fees, costs and expenses; and travel, lodging, entertainment and
associated expenses) incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary or LRPHI prior

Agreement, all fees payable by the Company or any Subsidiary or LRPHI to any
Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Bonus Amounts, the Warrant Payment and
any amount paid to purchase the DandO Tail Policy shall be allocated to the
taxable period or the portion of the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date, except as required by Applicable Law or agreed by the parties in
writing.

 



 

SECTION 8.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser._ From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify each Seller, its
affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ")
against and hold each of them harmless from, any Losses suffered or incurred
by such Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising from, relating to or otherwise
in respect of:

 



 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser in this
Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.03(c); and

 



 

(ii) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, each
Seller acknowledges that its sole and exclusive monetary remedy after the
Closing with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company or any
Subsidiary and its assets and liabilities (other than (x) pursuant to the
terms of any Employment Agreement) or (y) claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Seller
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) for damages it may
have against Purchaser or the Company arising under or based upon this
Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith (other
than any Employment Agreement), any Applicable Law (including any relating to
environmental matters), common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 8.02). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) to the extent an Individual Seller is an employee or
officer of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, such Individual Seller is
not waiving such Individual Seller's right (in his capacity as an employee),
if any, to accrued and unpaid salary, bonus, employee benefits, and business
expenses that are payable in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and (ii) if an Individual Seller was a manager or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit such Individual Seller from pursuing claims directly against
the insurance carrier under any DandO Tail Policy.

 



 

SECTION 8.03. _Calculation of Losses._ The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VIII shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies
or other sources of indemnification with respect to such Loss; _provided_ that
the amount deemed to be so recovered under any insurance policy or other
source of indemnification shall be net of the applicable deductible for such
policy and any increase in premium for such policy directly attributable to
such Loss. The amount of the Loss arising out of any item included as a
liability in calculating Closing Adjusted Working Capital shall be calculated
net of the amount so included. The amount of the Loss arising out of any
reduction in value of any Current Asset acquired at the Closing shall be
calculated net of the reported value of such Current Asset used in calculating
Closing Adjusted Working Capital. In the event that an insurance or other
recovery is made by any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to any Loss
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (after
deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnitee in procuring such recovery) shall be made promptly to Sellers;
_provided_ that prior to the termination of the Escrow Account, any such
amount recovered by a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be deposited in the Escrow
Account to fund the indemnification obligations of Sellers under Section
8.01(a) if the amount previously so paid to or on behalf of such Purchaser
Indemnitee was funded out of the Escrow Account.

 



 

SECTION 8.04. _Termination of Indemnification._ The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(i) or
Section 8.02(a)(i) shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates pursuant to Section 8.06, (ii) pursuant to Section
8.01(a)(ii), Section 8.01(a)(iii) or Section 8.02(a)(ii) shall terminate when
the applicable covenant terminates pursuant to Section 8.06; and (iii)
pursuant to Section 8.01(e) or Section 8.01(f) shall terminate when the
applicable statute of limitations terminates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified shall have,
before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by
delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of
such claim, the amount of such claim (if known and quantifiable) and the
provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is
made) pursuant to Section 8.05 to the party to be providing the
indemnification.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 8.05. _Procedures._ _Third Party Claims._ In order for a person
(the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided
for under Section 8.01 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made
by any person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such
indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (stating in
reasonable detail the basis of such claim, the amount of such claim (if known
and quantifiable) and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) of the Third Party Claim promptly following
receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the
indemnifying party, promptly following the indemnified party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) _Assumption._ If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
selected by the indemnifying party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel
is not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party. Should the
indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party
shall control such defense. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period
during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all
the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying
party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not
the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying
party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or
discharge of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and
that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of
the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which releases the
indemnified party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and
that would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party in any
material respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the
indemnified party in defending such Third Party Claim) (x) unless the
indemnifying party acknowledges in writing, based on the alleged facts stated
in the notice delivered to the indemnifying party pursuant to Section 8.05(a),
its irrevocable and unconditional obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party hereunder (subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII),
(y) there is reasonable probability that the indemnifying party shall, after
giving effect to the limitations set forth in Section 8.01(b) and the other
provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, bear in excess of
50% of any Losses with respect to such claim and (z) if the Third Party Claim
involves primarily a claim for monetary damages and any claim for an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than monetary damages
against the indemnified party as part of such claim is only incidental to such
claim for monetary damages ( _provided_ that if the Third Party Claim seeks
more than an incidental order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief
for other than monetary damages against the indemnified party that the
indemnified party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside
counsel, can be readily separated from any related claim for monetary damages,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the control of the defense
of the portion relating to monetary damages).

 



 

 



   



 

(c) _Other Claims._ In the event any indemnified party should have a
claim against any indemnifying party under Section 8.01 or Section 8.02 that
does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party.
Subject to Sections 8.04 and 8.06, the failure by any indemnified party so to
notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from
any liability that it may have to such indemnified party under Section 8.01 or
Section 8.02, as applicable, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. If the
indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within 30 calendar
days following its receipt of such notice that the indemnifying party disputes
its liability to the indemnified party under Section 8.01 or Section 8.02, as
applicable, such claim specified by the indemnified party in such notice shall
be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party under Section
8.01 or Section 8.02, as applicable, and the indemnifying party shall pay the
amount of such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of
any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion
thereof) becomes finally determined.

 



 

(d) _Mitigation._ Purchaser and each Seller shall cooperate with each
other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which
one party is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by
making commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim
or liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that such party shall not be required
to make such efforts if they would be detrimental in any material respect to
such party.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 8.06. _Survival of Representations._ The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and in any
document delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Closing solely for
purposes of this Article VIII as follows: (a) the Fundamental Representations
and the representations and warranties in Section 4.01, 4.02 and 4.06 shall
survive indefinitely; (b) the representations and warranties in Section 3.08
shall survive for two years following the Closing; (c) the representations and
warranties in Section 3.11 and the covenants in Section 5.09 shall survive the
Closing until the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations; (d) the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in Article II, Article III
and Article IV (other than those specified in clauses (a) through (c) above)
and Section 5.01 shall survive for 18 months following the Closing, (e) the
covenants in Sections 5.04 and 5.11 shall survive as provided therein, (f) the
other covenants contained in this Agreement (other than those specified in
clauses (c), (d) and (e) above) (i) which are expressly to be performed prior
to Closing shall terminate on the Closing Date and (ii) otherwise shall
terminate once such covenants are fully performed and (g) all other provisions
of this Agreement shall survive indefinitely.

 



 

SECTION 8.07. _No Additional Representations._ Purchaser acknowledges
that none of Sellers, the Company or any other person has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Company or any
Subsidiary or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company and the Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Purchaser and its
representatives, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Purchaser
acknowledges that, should the Closing occur, Purchaser shall acquire the
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries without any representation or
warranty as to merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, in an
"as is" condition and on a "where is" basis, except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement.

assignor's obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of

SECTION 9.05. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Any
counterpart, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by
.pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or similar attachment to electronic mail shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person.

 



 

SECTION 9.06. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements, and the Confidentiality Agreement, contain the entire agreement
and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such
subject matter, except any agreement among Sellers with respect to the rights
and obligations of Sellers' Representative. None of the parties shall be
liable or bound to any other party in any manner by any representations,
warranties or covenants relating to such subject matter except as specifically
set forth in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 9.07. _Severability._ If any provision of this Agreement (or any
portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion
thereof) to any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or the application of such
provision to any other persons or circumstances.

 



 

SECTION 9.08. _Specific Performance._ Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that the rights of each party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby are unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of
a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and
the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the
parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition
to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity,
to enforce their rights and the other party's obligations hereunder not only
by an action or actions for damages but also by an action or actions for
specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without
posting of bond or other security).

 



 

SECTION 9.09. _Consent to Jurisdiction._ Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement (including Section 1.04), any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware, the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any
other court of the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 9.03 shall
be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 



 

SECTION 9.10. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

 



   



 

SECTION 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.11.

 



 

SECTION 9.12. _Legal Representation._ Following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP may serve as
counsel to any Seller (including Sellers' Representative) in connection with
any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation or any continued representation of any other person
(including Sellers' Representative), and each of the parties hereto consents
thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Any privilege
attaching as a result of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP representing a Seller or
the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, provided that such
privilege from and after the Closing shall be assigned to and controlled by
Sellers. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties agree to take
the steps necessary to ensure that any privilege attaching as a result of
Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP representing any Seller and/or the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall survive
the Closing, remain in effect and be assigned to and controlled by Sellers. As
to any privileged attorney client communications between Morgan, Lewis and
Bockius LLP and Sellers or the Company prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), Purchaser, together with
any of its affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company), successors
or assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of the parties
hereto or any of their respective affiliates after the Closing. Purchaser (on
behalf of itself and the Company after the Closing) further agrees that
Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP's retention by the Company shall be deemed
completed and terminated without any further action by any person effective as
of the Closing.
