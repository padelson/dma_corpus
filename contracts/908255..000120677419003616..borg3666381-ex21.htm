ARTICLE I 
 _PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING_

  

Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller hereby sells, assigns and transfers
to Buyer, and Buyer hereby purchases from Seller, the Company Interests free
and clear of all Liens (other than Liens on transfer imposed under applicable
securities Laws) (the " _Sale_ ") in exchange for the covenants and agreements
of Buyer contained herein and in the Buyer Guarantee.

        

Section 1.2 _The Closing_.

  

(a) The closing of the Sale (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New
York 10017 on the date hereof (the " _Closing Date_ ").

  

(b) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer:

  

(i) certificates representing the Company Interests, duly endorsed by the
Seller for transfer to the Buyer;

  

(ii) an assignment and assumption of the Company Interests, duly executed by
Seller conveying to Buyer all of the Seller's right, title and interest to the
Company Interests free and clear of all Liens (other than Liens on transfer
imposed under applicable securities Laws);

  

(iii) letter of resignation from the directors and officers of the Company set
forth in _Section 1.2_ of the Disclosure Schedules;

  

(iv) evidence reasonably acceptable to Buyer of the Company's receipt of the
Closing Payment;

  

(v) evidence reasonably acceptable to Buyer that the Company has been released
from all intercompany loans and other obligations owed by it to Seller or any
of its Affiliates, other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(vi) all minute books and corporate seals for the Company;

  

(vii) a certification of Seller's non-foreign status as set forth in Section

(viii) the Buyer Guarantee, duly executed by Seller and the Company.

  

(c) _Buyer 's Deliverables_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Seller:

  

(i) an assignment and assumption of the Company Interests, duly executed by
Buyer;

  

(ii) the Buyer Guarantee, duly executed by Buyer.

       

Section 1.3 _Closing Payment Adjustment_.

  

(a) _Schedule 1.3_ attached hereto is Seller's good faith estimate and
calculation of the Roll-Forward Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated Roll-
Forward Amount_ " and such statement, the " _Estimated Roll-Forward Amount
Statement_ ").

  

(b) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 30 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer may, at its option, deliver Buyer's calculation of the Roll-
Forward Amount to Seller (the " _Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement_ ").

  

(c) If Buyer delivers the Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement, Buyer will,
and will cause the Company to (i) assist Seller and its representatives in the
review of the Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement and provide Seller and its
representatives with full access during normal business hours to the books,
records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents),
supporting data, facilities and employees of the Company for purposes of their
review of the Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement, and (ii) cooperate with
Seller and its representatives in connection with such review, including
providing on a timely basis all other information necessary or useful in
connection with the review of the Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement as is
reasonably requested by Seller or its representatives. If Seller has any
objections to the Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement, Seller will deliver
to Buyer a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an " _Objections
Statement_ "), which statement will identify in reasonable detail those items
and amounts to which Seller objects (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If an
Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 30 days after delivery
of the Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement, the Closing Roll-Forward Amount
Statement as prepared by Buyer will be final, binding and non-appealable by
the Parties. Seller and Buyer will negotiate in good faith to resolve any
Disputed Items and all such discussions related thereto will (unless otherwise
agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if they do not reach a
final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement
to Buyer, Seller and Buyer will submit any unresolved Disputed Items to the
Independent Accountant. In the event the Parties submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to the Independent Accountant, each Party will submit its
proposed version of the Closing Roll-Forward Amount Statement (each a "
_Proposed Roll-Forward Amount Statement_ ") (which in the case of each Party
may be a statement that, with respect to the unresolved Disputed Items (but
not with respect to any other items, except to the extent that such other
items relate to the Disputed Items), is different than the Closing Roll-
Forward Amount Statement initially submitted to Seller or the Objections
Statement delivered to Buyer, as applicable) together with such supporting
documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Independent Accountant within
ten (10) days after the date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were
submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution. Seller and Buyer will
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event
within 30 days after the date on which the Independent Accountant receives the
Proposed Roll-Forward Amount Statements prepared by Seller and Buyer. The
Independent Accountant will resolve such dispute by choosing, in its entirety,
the Proposed Roll-Forward Amount Statement proposed by either Seller or Buyer,
and will make no other resolution of such dispute (including by combining
elements of the Proposed Roll-Forward Amount Statements submitted by both
Parties). The Proposed Roll-Forward Amount Statement selected by the
Independent Accountant will be final, binding and non-appealable by the
Parties. Each Party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection with
the resolution of such dispute by the Independent Accountant. The costs and
expenses of the Independent Accountant will be paid by the Party whose
Proposed Roll-Forward Amount Statement is not chosen by the Independent
Accountant in its resolution of the dispute.

       

(d) If the Roll-Forward Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.3(c)_ (the " _Final Roll-Forward Amount_ ") is less than the Estimated Roll-
Forward Amount, then, within five business days after the determination of the
Final Roll-Forward Amount, Seller will pay an amount equal to such shortfall
to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by the Company to Seller.

  

(e) If the Final Roll-Forward Amount is greater than the Estimated Roll-
Forward Amount, then, within five business days after the determination of the
Final Roll-Forward Amount, the Company will pay an amount equal to such excess
to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by Seller to the Company.

  

(f) All payments required pursuant to _Section 1.3(d)_ and _Section 1.3(e)_
will be deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the Closing Payment,
unless otherwise required by Law.

 _COVENANTS_

  

Section 4.1 _Pre-Closing Books and Records_.

  

(a) Following the Closing, Seller shall retain ownership of all books and
records relating to the accounting, legal, litigation, tax, regulatory,
business and financial affairs of the Company relating to the period prior to
the Closing (" _Pre-Closing Books and Records_ "). Seller will preserve and
keep all Pre-Closing Books and Records for not less than ten (10) years after
the Closing or for any longer period as may be (i) required by Law (including
any statute of limitations and applicable extensions thereof) or any
Governmental Entity or (ii) reasonably necessary with respect to the
prosecution or defense of any audit or Claim that is then pending or
threatened and with respect to which Buyer or the Company has notified Seller
as to the need to retain such Pre-Closing Books and Records.

  

(b) After the Closing, Seller will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, afford to the Buyer and its Representatives (at the
Buyer's sole expense), access (i) to the Pre-Closing Books and Records during
normal business hours upon reasonable notice by Buyer and Buyer shall be
entitled to make and keep copies of the Pre-Closing Books and Records and (ii)
to such employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably necessary to
resolve any Claims for which the Company is responsible. At the Closing,
Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered to the Buyer electronic copies of
the Pre-Closing Books and Records to the extent such electronic copies are in
Seller's possession as of the date hereof.

  

(c) After the Closing, in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or
litigation involving Seller or its Affiliates, Buyer will cause the Company to
afford to Seller and its Representatives (in each case, at Seller's sole
expense) access during normal business hours upon reasonable notice by Seller
to (i) all books and records relating to the accounting, legal, litigation,
tax, regulatory, business and financial affairs of the Company relating to the
period after to the Closing to the extent reasonably related to such audit,
investigation, dispute or litigation and (ii) to such employees of the Company
as is reasonably necessary in connection therewith.

       

(d) All information received pursuant to this _Section 4.1_ that is not
generally available to the public shall be kept confidential by the Party
obtaining such information, subject to any disclosure (i) to such Party's
Representatives that are subject to confidentiality obligations (with such
Party responsible for any breach of confidentiality by such Representatives)
or (ii) that is required to be made by such Party in order to comply with
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange upon
which its securities or the securities of its Affiliates are traded provided
that reasonable notice (and consultation to the extent practicable) shall be
provided to the other Party prior to any such disclosure. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Party (or its Affiliates) shall be required to provide such
access or furnish such information if it in good faith reasonably believes
that doing so would be reasonably be expected to (x) breach or violate any
applicable Law or Order, (y) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege,
work product protection or any other evidentiary privilege or protection, or
(z) violate any confidentiality obligation with respect to such information,
_provided_ that in each case of (x), (y) and (z) the Parties agree to
collaborate in good faith to make alternative arrangements to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set forth
in (x), (y) or (z).

  

Section 4.2 _Publicity_. In connection with the execution of this Agreement,
each Party may issue a mutually agreed press release regarding the
transactions contemplated herein and no Party shall issue a separate press
release regarding the transactions contemplated herein without the prior
written approval of the other Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, this
provision shall not restrict the Parties from disclosing information about the
transactions contemplated herein as may be required or advisable (in the good
faith judgment of such Party or its outside counsel) under applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of any securities exchange upon which its securities
or the securities of its Affiliates are traded.

  

Section 4.3 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

  

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer will cause the
Company to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the same extent required by
the Constituent Documents of Seller and the Company and in effect on the date
of this Agreement and as permitted under applicable Law, all past and present
managers, directors and officers of the Company (each, together with such
person's heirs, executors or administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_
") against any liabilities, damages, costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any Claims (whether
asserted before or after the Closing) arising out of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing in connection with such Company
Indemnified Party having served as a manager, director or officer of the
Company or having served at the request of the Company as a manager, director,
officer or employee of any other corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other business,
and, to the same extent that such Company Indemnified Parties have the right
to advancement of expenses from the Company as of the date of this Agreement,
to provide advancement of expenses to any such Company Indemnified Party,
subject to receipt of an undertaking from such Company Indemnified Party to
repay such advanced amounts if it is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final judgment that such Company Indemnified Party was not
entitled to indemnification. Buyer shall cause the Company to include and
maintain in effect, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the
provisions regarding indemnification and elimination of liability of managers,
officers and directors that are in the Company's Constituent Documents as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement. Buyer shall cause the Company to
honor all indemnification agreements with any Company Indemnified Party in
effect as of the date of this Agreement only to the extent such
indemnification agreements are set forth on _Section 4.3(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules.

       

(b) Within five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date, the Company
shall, and at the expense of Buyer, purchase tail coverage with alternative
insurers that have a rating of at least A- with AM Best for the benefit of
each Company Indemnified Party, which provides coverage for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing with terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to such
Company Indemnified Parties than the terms and conditions of the existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy of the Company.

 

(c) In the event that the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights and
other assets to any Person, then, in each such case to the extent so required,
Buyer shall cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign
of the Company assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 4.3_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 4.3_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties following the
Closing and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification, advancement or contribution that any such Person may have
by Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

Section 4.4 _Termination of Affiliate Arrangements_. Except as set forth on
_Section 4.4_ of the Disclosure Schedules, effective as of the Closing, Seller
shall terminate (or cause to be terminated) all intercompany agreements,
Contracts and transactions between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other hand, with no
further obligations of or liability to the Company or Seller or their
respective Affiliates with respect to any such Contracts or transactions.

 

Section 4.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Company to provide, during the two
(2) year period following the Closing Date, to employees of the Company who
continue to be employed by the Company following the Closing (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") (i) annual base salary, base wages, and target
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than those
provided by the Company, the Seller or their Affiliates (as applicable)
immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefits at levels no less
favorable than the employee benefits provided by Buyer and its Affiliates to
similarly-situated employees.

   

(b) Buyer will give, or cause the Company or its Affiliates following the
Closing to give, each Continuing Employee credit for the Continuing Employee's
service with the Seller, the Company or their Affiliates (as applicable) prior
to the Closing for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting and accrual of
benefits (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan), to
the same extent such service was recognized with respect to each Continuing
Employee prior to the Closing, except in each case, to the extent such
treatment would result in duplicative benefits. Buyer will, or will cause an
Affiliate to, assume and honor all accrued and unused vacation and paid time
off balances of the Continuing Employees. Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially
reasonable efforts, to, (x) waive any preexisting condition limitations
otherwise applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents
under any plan of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates that provides group
health benefits in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate following the Closing (such plans, the " _Buyer Plans_ "), to the
extent waived or satisfied with respect to such employees as of the Closing
under the analogous benefit plan covering such Continuing Employee prior to
Closing, (y) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums
incurred or paid by Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under
the benefit plan providing group health benefits in which such Continuing
Employees participated immediately prior to the Closing during the portion of
the calendar year prior to the Closing in satisfying any deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums under a Buyer Plan in the same plan year in
which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred,
and (z) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability
requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Continuing Employee and
such Continuing Employee's eligible dependents on or after the Closing, in
each case, to the extent such Continuing Employee or eligible dependent had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior
to the Closing.

 

(c) Buyer will cause the Company following the Closing to honor the annual
cash incentive awards or program applicable to each Continuing Employee for
calendar year 2019 that are disclosed in _Section 4.5(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules. The Company (following the Closing) will pay to Continuing
Employees such 2019 bonus in the ordinary course (and at the time ordinarily
paid) in an amount no less than the target payout for each Continuing Employee
for the 2019 fiscal year; _provided_ , that if any Continuing Employee is
involuntarily terminated by the Company (following the Closing) without cause
(or, as applicable, if the Continuing Employee terminates for "good reason"
(as defined in such Continuing Employee's employment or similar agreement))
prior to the bonus payment date, a prorated portion of such bonus (based on
the target payout) shall be paid to such terminated Continuing Employee.

 

(d) The Buyer and the Seller shall each take all actions necessary to provide
that each Continuing Employee who so elects may make a direct rollover (as
described in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of his or her account balance
under any 401(k) plan maintained by the Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Company), including any promissory notes evidencing outstanding loan
balances under such plan, to a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliate (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "), and the Buyer shall cause the Buyer
401(k) Plan to accept such direct rollovers (including any promissory notes
evidencing outstanding loan balances under such plan).

 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this _Section 4.5_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to be an amendment or
other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of
Buyer, (ii) create any third party rights in any Person or (iii) alter or
limit the ability of the Company following the Closing, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan,
Buyer Plan or other employee benefit program, agreement or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

   

(f) Buyer acknowledges that the Contracts set forth on _Section 4.5(f)(i)_ of
the Disclosure Schedules are, as of the Closing, obligations of the Company
and such Contracts shall remain the obligations of the Company following the
Closing. Following the Closing, Buyer shall negotiate in good faith with the
Continuing Employees set forth on _Section 4.5(f)(ii)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules with respect to potential amendments to their respective employment
(or similar) agreements as set forth on _Section 4.5(f)(ii)_ of the Disclosure
Schedules.

 

Section 4.6 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall timely prepare or cause
to be timely prepared and shall timely file or cause to be timely filed with
the appropriate taxing authorities all such Tax Returns described in the
preceding sentence. Seller shall timely pay all Taxes due with respect to any
Tax Return described in this _Section 4.6(a)(i)_. With respect to any Tax
Return filed after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver a completed draft of
said Tax Return (or redacted or _pro forma_ draft of said return to the extent
the return is filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis and includes
information about the Seller group outside of the Company) to Buyer for
Buyer's review and comment a reasonable period of time prior to the filing
thereof (such reasonable period to be at least thirty (30) days in the case of
any U.S. federal income Tax Return and at least three (3) days in the case of
any state or local income Tax Return). Seller shall reflect all comments of
Buyer, acting reasonably, on the Tax Returns that are filed pursuant to this
_Section 4.6(a)(i)_. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall provide to Buyer
with any Tax Return described herein any workpaper, calculation, schedule,
election, form or similar document that reflects and/or makes effective the
(i) Pre-Closing Election and Tax treatment described in _Section 2.11(1)_
hereof, (ii) election described in _Section 4.6(i)_ hereof, and (iii)
election, if necessary, pursuant to Section 362(e)(2)(C) described in Section
2.11(1). If no Tax Return is due or must be filed with respect to the actions
described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence,
Seller shall nonetheless provide the workpaper, calculation, schedule,
election, form or similar document that reflects and/or makes effective the
election or Tax treatment contemplated herein to Buyer.

 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the
Company for all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date. Tax Returns for
Straddle Periods shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practices
of the Company except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law.
Buyer shall permit the Seller to review and comment on each such Tax Return
for Straddle Periods prior to the filing thereof. Buyer will consider all such
comments in good faith. Buyer shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns subject to its right to indemnification for the portion of said Taxes
for which Seller is responsible pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)(iii)_ and in
accordance with the methodology set forth in _Section 4.6(b)_.

   

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be:

 

(i) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal
property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and

 

(ii) In the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed
in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real
or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be
determined as if such Tax period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions), other than with respect to property placed in service after the
Closing, shall be allocated on a per diem basis.

 

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, the taxable year of the
Company that includes the Closing Date shall close, and in any event shall be
treated as closing, at the end of the day on the Closing Date for all income
Tax purposes, and all income Tax Returns shall be filed consistently with the
foregoing.

 

(d) Buyer, the Company and the Seller shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
other representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all periods
relating to Taxes, including by maintaining and making available to each other
all records necessary in connection with Taxes and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of any material provided hereunder; provided that nothing in this
_Section 4.6(d)_ shall require a party to provide the other party with any
consolidated, combined unitary or other Tax Return of such party, except as
otherwise contemplated in _Section 4.6(a)_ with respect to the reporting for
Tax purposes of the elections and Tax treatment described in _Section 4.6(i)_
and _Section 4.6(j)_.

 

(e) With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date, without the prior written
consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall cause the Company not to (i) make, change
or rescind any Tax election, (ii) amend any Tax Return, (iii) file any Tax
Return in a jurisdiction in which the Company did not file previously (unless
Buyer reasonably determines that such filing is necessary based on a change in
circumstances occurring after the taxable period in respect of any previously
filed Tax Return), (iv) engage in any voluntary disclosure or similar process
with any taxing authority, (v) extend the statute of limitations with respect
to any Tax, or (vi) take any other action, in each case that would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of increasing the liability of the Seller for
Taxes pursuant to _Article V_ of this Agreement.

   

(f) _Tax Claims_.

 

(i) With respect to any Tax audit or similar administrative or judicial
proceeding for Taxes of the Company related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for
which a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement could be made (a
" _Tax Claim_ "), the Seller shall, solely at its cost and expense, control
all such Tax Claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Buyer shall have the
right to fully participate in any such Tax Claim with counsel of its own
choosing, (ii) Seller shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed of such Tax
Claim, and (iii) Seller shall first consult, in good faith with Buyer before
taking any action with respect to the conduct of such Tax Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not settle such Tax Claim
without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(ii) Buyer shall control all Tax audits or similar administrative or judicial
proceedings for Taxes related to any claim for Taxes of the Company for a
Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not settle such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording
charges (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50%
by Seller. The Party required by applicable Law to do so shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the other Parties shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other necessary and required documentation.

 

(h) _Tax Refunds and Credits_. Seller shall be entitled to any refund or
credit of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or which relate to the portion
of a Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date. Buyer shall, if
Seller so reasonably requests and at Seller's expense, file for and obtain or
cause its relevant Affiliates to file for and obtain any refunds or credits
with respect to such Tax periods; provided, that Buyer shall not be required
to take any action to the extent such action is reasonably expected to be
materially adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Seller shall have the
right to control the conduct of any such claim for any Pre-Closing Tax period
at Seller's sole cost and expense; provided that (i) Seller shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed regarding the status of any such claim, (ii) Buyer shall
have the right to participate fully in any such proceeding, including
selecting counsel of its choosing to represent Buyer and (iii) Seller shall
not settle or compromise any such claim without obtaining the advance written
consent of Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Payments pursuant to this _Section 4.6(h)_ shall be made in
immediately available funds within 15 days of the actual receipt or
realization of the applicable refund or credit (and shall include, for the
avoidance of doubt, any interest paid thereon, but shall be net of any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses of Buyer and any
Taxes in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit). Buyer
shall control any such claims related to a Straddle Period; provided that (i)
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding the status of any such
claim, (ii) Seller shall have the right to participate fully in any such
proceeding, including selecting counsel of its choosing to represent Seller
and (iii) Buyer shall not settle or compromise any such claim without
obtaining the advance written consent of Seller (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

   

(i) _Tax Election_. Seller shall make or cause to be made and effective for
the Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date an election pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce the Seller's Tax
basis in the Company Interests to the extent necessary such that the Company's
Tax attributes, available for reduction under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(4), are not subject to reduction under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-36(d).

 

Section 4.7 _Administration of Claims Post-Closing_. Following the Closing,
the Seller will promptly notify the Company of any Claims that Seller or its
Affiliates receive with respect to the Asbestos-Related Liabilities or the
Environmental Liabilities. The Company will promptly assume defense of any
Claims with respect to the Asbestos-Related Liabilities or the Environmental
Liabilities (regardless of whether initially received by the Company or by
Seller or its Affiliates) and take such actions as are necessary to (a)
actively pursue such defense in a manner reasonably intended to mitigate and
minimize any Losses related thereto and (b) ensure the Company (and not the
Seller or any Affiliate) is named as the defendant therein.

 

Section 4.8 _Recovery Rights_. Following the Closing, the Seller hereby
assigns to the Company, and the Company shall be entitled to exercise, (a) all
rights and remedies of the Seller and its Affiliates under the Insurance
Policies and (b) all rights and remedies of the Seller and its Affiliates to
be indemnified for Asbestos-Related Liabilities or the Environmental
Liabilities pursuant to any Third Party Assumption Agreements. From and after
the Closing, Seller hereby assigns to the Company and relinquishes any and all
of its Recovery Rights with respect to the Insurance Policies and the Third
Party Assumption Agreements (to the extent related to Asbestos-Related
Liabilities or Environmental Liabilities). The Company hereby agrees that, in
the event Buyer or the Company fails to promptly exercise such Recovery Rights
in connection with a matter against which Seller is to be indemnified pursuant
to _Section 5.2(c)_ and the Company fails to so indemnify Seller, Seller shall
be provided the opportunity to exercise such Recovery Rights. Following the
Closing, the Company will retain all of its Recovery Rights. The Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all such commercially reasonable
further action that is necessary or useful to effectuate the intent of this
_Section 4.8_ , including by providing the Company the benefit of such
Recovery Rights if such rights are not assignable. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller is retaining all rights under any Third Party Assumption Agreements to
the extent not related to Asbestos-Related Liabilities or Environmental
Liabilities (including the right to make Claims (and settle Claims) to the
extent not related to Asbestos-Related Liabilities or Environmental
Liabilities under such Third Party Assumption Agreements).

   

Section 4.9 _Transition Services_. Until no later than the date that is three
(3) months after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide, at cost, Buyer and
the Company with such transition services, including use of the office space
currently occupied by the Continuing Employees, as Buyer reasonably requests
to support the work performed by the Continuing Employees on behalf of the
Company in a manner following the Closing that is substantially similar to the
work they performed for the Company prior to the Closing; _provided_ that, the
Seller shall not be required to provide the services set forth in _Section
4.9_ of the Disclosure Schedules.

 

Section 4.10 _Cooperation_. Each of the Parties agrees to keep the other Party
reasonably informed of material events, changes and developments with respect
to the matters described in Section 4.10 of the Disclosure Schedules; provided
that neither Party (or its Affiliates) shall be required to provide or furnish
information if it in good faith reasonably believes that doing so would be
reasonably be expected to (x) breach or violate any applicable Law or Order,
(y) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege, work product protection
or any other evidentiary privilege or protection, or (z) violate any
confidentiality obligation with respect to such information, provided that in
each case of (x), (y) and (z) the Parties agree to collaborate in good faith
to make alternative arrangements to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in the events set forth in (x), (y) or (z).

 

Section 4.11 _Name Change_.

 

(a) Within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company
to adopt, execute, deliver and file such resolutions and other instruments as
may be necessary or advisable to change the name of the Company from
"BorgWarner Morse TEC LLC" to another name that does not include "BorgWarner"
but does include either "Morse" or "Morse TEC".

 

(b) Seller hereby grants to the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable license to continue using the trade names "Morse" and/or
"Morse TEC" solely as part of the corporate name of the Company and solely in
connection with the operation of the management of Claims related to the
Asbestos-Related Liabilities and the Environmental Liabilities until such
Claims have been satisfied.

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Seller in

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)(i)_
until: (x) with respect to any given claim for Losses, such claim is
individually (or when aggregated with claims arising out of the same or
similar facts and circumstances) in excess of $25,000 (the " _Individual
Basket Amount_ ") (it being understood that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may
recover for the full amount of such Losses once the claim exceeds such
Individual Basket Amount) and (y) the aggregate Losses of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to indemnification claims pursuant to
_Section 5.2(a)(i)_ that individually exceed the Individual Basket Amount

Parties shall be entitled to recover such Losses solely in excess of the
Deductible; _provided_ that, in each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this

Seller for such indemnification claims shall not exceed the Closing Payment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate liability of the Seller for all
indemnification claims brought pursuant to clause (D) of _Section 5.2(a)(iii)_
shall not exceed the amount set forth on _Section 5.2(a)(iii)_ of the
Disclosure Schedules.

  

(b) _By the Buyer_. From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and each of their
respective managers, officers, directors, employees, agents and other
Representatives (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any
and all Losses, relating to, arising out of or attributable to:

  

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Buyer in
this Agreement; and

  

(ii) any breach of or failure by Buyer to perform, or cause to be performed,
any of the covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement, the Buyer
Guarantee or any other agreement contemplated hereunder to which Buyer is a
party.

  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
5.2(b)(i)_ until: (x) with respect to any given claim for Losses, such claim
is individually (or when aggregated with claims arising out of the same or
similar facts and circumstances) in excess of the Individual Basket Amount (it
being understood that the Seller Indemnified Parties may recover for the full
amount of such Losses once the claim exceeds such Individual Basket Amount)
and (y) the aggregate Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to
indemnification claims pursuant to _Section 5.2(b)(i)_ that individually
exceed the Individual Basket Amount exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount
equal to the Deductible, whereupon the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover such Losses solely in excess of the Deductible; _provided_
that, in each case of clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence, the foregoing
limitations shall not apply with respect to breaches of Buyer Fundamental
Representations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate liability of the
Buyer for all indemnification claims brought pursuant to _Section 5.2(b)(i)_
shall not exceed an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Closing Payment;
_provided_ that, with respect to breaches of Buyer Fundamental
Representations, the aggregate liability of the Buyer for such indemnification
claims shall not exceed the Closing Payment.

          

(c) _By the Company_. From and after the Closing, the Company shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Party from and against any
and all Losses relating to, arising out of or attributable to:

  

(i) the Asbestos-Related Liabilities; and

  

(ii) the Environmental Liabilities; _provided_ that, the indemnity obligation
set forth in this _Section 5.2(c)_ shall not apply to the extent Seller is
providing an indemnity to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for such liability or
obligation as set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_.

  

(d) _Mitigation_. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses claimed under this _Article V_ upon becoming aware of such
Losses.

  

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. Other than with respect to matters involving Fraud or
for which the remedy of specific performance, injunctive relief or other non-
monetary equitable remedies are available, indemnification pursuant to this
_Article V_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of all parties from and
after the Closing with respect to any matter arising under this Agreement of
any kind or nature, including for any misrepresentation or breach of any
warranty, covenant, or other provision contained in this Agreement, and the
Parties hereto hereby waive and release any other rights, remedies, causes of
action, or claims that either of them have or that may arise against any other
Party with respect thereto.

  

(f) The amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is provided
pursuant to this _Article V_ (other than _Section 5.2(a)(iii)(D)_ ) will be
net of any reduction in taxes actually realized (determined on a "with or
without" basis) by an Indemnified Party (as determined in its reasonable
discretion exercised in good faith) by reason of payment of such obligation
or liability (taking into account any tax cost or reduction in such tax
benefits by reason of receipt of the indemnification payment) and any amounts
of any insurance proceeds, other indemnification payments, contribution
payments or reimbursements actually received (net of any deductibles and the
costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements) by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses or any
of the circumstances giving rise thereto, which the Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Indemnified Party is entitled to claims or payments in respect of the
same factual circumstances under more than one provision of this Agreement,
it will only be entitled to recover indemnification for any specific Loss
once under the provisions of this Agreement.

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to any indemnification arising out of any Losses
(i) for any Taxes arising in any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date attributable to a breach of the representations in
_Section 2.11_ , other than the representations in _Section 2.11(e)_ or
_Section 2.11(i)_ , _Section 2.11(j)_ , _Section 2.11(k)_ or _Section 2.11(l)_
, or (ii) for Taxes arising from actions of Buyer or its Affiliates on the
Closing Date after the Closing outside the ordinary course of business.

        

Section 5.3 _Procedure for Indemnification_.

  

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification under _Section 5.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") (except
indemnification claims with respect to _Section 5.2(a)(i)_ which arise under
_Section 2.11_ or _Section 5.2(a)(iii)_ , both of which shall be governed by
_Section 4.6(f)_ ) shall, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, promptly
notify in writing the Seller and, in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party,
promptly notify in writing the Buyer or the Company, as applicable (any such
notice, a " _Notice of Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on
the part of any Indemnified Party in providing such notice shall adversely
affect the rights of the Indemnified Party under _Section 5.2_. The Notice of
Claim shall set forth in reasonable detail (i) the date and nature and basis
of such claim and (ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Seller, the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, in relation to such
claim.

  

(b) If a claim for indemnification is with respect to a Claim by a third-party
against an Indemnified Party, the Seller, in the case of a claim by a Buyer
Indemnified Party and Buyer or the Company, in the case of a claim by a Seller
Indemnified Party (the Seller, Buyer or the Company, as applicable, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), shall be entitled (but not obligated) to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party (subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnified Party) at the
Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense; _provided_ _however_ that prior
to assuming such control of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in
writing that it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Claim to the extent provided for in, and subject to the limitations
of, this _Article V_. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the judgment or proposed settlement
(i) releases the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all liability or
obligation in connection with such Claim, (ii) does not impose an injunction
or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates and
(iii) does not involve a finding or admission of any violation of applicable
Law or other wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such a Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense,
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its
attorneys in such defense. In any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at its own expense unless representation of both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would represent a
conflict of interest for such counsel under applicable standards of
professional conduct for attorneys, in which case the Indemnifying Party will
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel.

  

(c) An indemnity payment made by the Buyer or the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or an audit or other
administrative or judicial action with respect to either of such Parties
causes any such payment not to constitute an adjustment to the purchase price
for Tax purposes.

both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.

  

(b) Any disclosure in any Party's Disclosure Schedule under this Agreement
corresponding to and qualifying a specific numbered paragraph shall be deemed
to correspond to and qualify any other numbered paragraph relating to such
Party to which the applicability of the disclosure is readily apparent on the
face of such disclosure. Certain information set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules is included solely for informational purposes, is not an admission
of liability with respect to the matters covered by the information, and may
not be required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The specification
of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedules is
not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or
are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item, or matter not described herein or included in a Disclosure
Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

       

Section 6.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
confer any rights (including the right to rely upon the representations,
warranties and covenants set forth herein), benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the provisions of _Section 4.3_ shall be
enforceable by each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs, executors
or administrators and representatives.

  

Section 6.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
(or part thereof) of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid, void, unenforceable
or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as
the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby,
taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party
hereto.

  

Section 6.8 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment

Section 6.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in

Section 6.10 _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) consents to
submit itself, and hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the City of Wilmington, or, if

of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of
venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware in the City of Wilmington, or, if such court does not have subject

jurisdiction, and (d) consents to service of process being made through the

the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the City of Wilmington or, if
such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any court of the State
of Delaware, without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

        

Section 6.12 _Legal Representation_.

  

(a) Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP (" _STB_ ") has acted as counsel for the
Seller and the Company (prior to and including the Closing) (collectively, the
" _Company Parties_ ") in connection with the other transaction documents and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (the " _Acquisition
Engagement_ ") and, in that connection, not as counsel for any other Person,
including, without limitation, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company following the Closing). Only the Company Parties shall be considered
clients of STB in the Acquisition Engagement. If the Seller so desires, STB
shall be permitted, without the need for any future waiver or consent, to
represent the Seller after the Closing in connection with any matter related
to the matters contemplated by any of the other transaction documents or any
disagreement or dispute relating thereto and may in connection therewith
represent the Representatives or Affiliates of the Seller in any of the
foregoing cases including, without limitation, in any action, dispute,
litigation or other adversary proceeding against, with or involving Buyer, the
Company following the Closing or any of their Representatives or Affiliates.

  

(b) To the extent that communications between Seller, the Company or any of
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and STB, on the other hand, relate to the
Acquisition Engagement, such communication shall be deemed to be attorney-
client confidences that belong solely to the Seller. Neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates, including the Company following the Closing, shall have access
to (Buyer hereby waives, on behalf of each, any right of access it may
otherwise have with respect to) any such communications or the files or work
product of STB, to the extent that they relate to the Acquisition Engagement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, including the Company
following the Closing, upon and after the Closing: (i) the Seller and STB
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege of the Company
Parties with respect to the Acquisition Engagement, and neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates, including the Company following the Closing, shall be a
holder thereof; (ii) to the extent that files or work product of STB in
respect of the Acquisition Engagement constitute property of a client of STB,
only the Seller shall hold such property rights of any Company Parties and
have the right to waive or modify such property rights; and (iii) STB shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications, files or work product to Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
including the Company following the Closing, by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between STB and the Company Parties or otherwise; _provided_
that, to the extent any communication is both related and unrelated to the
Acquisition Engagement, STB shall provide (and the Seller, for and on behalf
of the other Company Parties, shall instruct STB to provide) appropriately
redacted versions of such communications, files or work product to Buyer or
its Affiliates, including the Company following the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between any of Buyer or the
Company following the Closing or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Seller, on the other hand, concerning the matters contemplated in any of the
transaction documents, Buyer, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and
the Company following the Closing and its Affiliates, agrees that Buyer, the
Company following the Closing and their Affiliates shall not offer into
evidence or otherwise attempt to use or assert the foregoing attorney-client
communications, files or work product against the Seller.

        

(c) Without limitation of the foregoing, any other communication between the
Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Representative of the Seller, the Company or any of their Affiliates (other
than STB) or any other third person, prior to the Closing and relating to the
Acquisition Engagement shall be deemed confidential information of the Seller,
and from and after the Closing, such communications shall be deemed to be
confidential information that belongs solely to the Seller. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall be entitled to transfer possession of such
communications (including any tangible and intangible copies of such
communications) to the Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between any of Buyer or the Company following the
Closing or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand, concerning the matters contemplated in any of the transaction documents
Buyer, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and the Company following
the Closing and its Affiliates, agrees that Buyer and the Company following
the Closing and their Affiliates shall not offer into evidence or otherwise
attempt to use or assert the foregoing communications against the Seller.

  

Section 6.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties (including by facsimile or
via portable document format (.pdf)), it being understood that all Parties
need not sign the same counterpart.
