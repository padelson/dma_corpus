AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 25, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ "), is among Galderma Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Galderma Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and CollaGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain terms used in this Agreement without definition shall have their meanings as defined in _Section 8.11_. 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company each deems it advisable that Parent acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof it is proposed that such acquisition be accomplished by (a) Purchaser commencing a tender offer to purchase all of the shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding (each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), for $16.60 per Share (such amount or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any required withholding of Taxes, net to the sellers in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (such cash tender offer, as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ "), and (b) following the consummation of the Offer, the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), pursuant to which (i) the Shares (other than certain Shares as provided in _Section 2.7(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price and (ii) the outstanding shares (each, a " _Series D-1 Share_" and, collectively, the " _Series D-1 Shares_") of the Series D-1 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (the " _Series D-1 Preferred Stock_") (other than certain Series D-1 Shares as provided in _Section 2.7(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such Series D-1 Shares are convertible pursuant to and in accordance with Section A.5 of the Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of the Series D-1 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, dated as of December 19, 2005 (the " _Series D-1 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation_") multiplied by the Offer Price, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ "); 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent (on its own behalf and as the sole direct or indirect stockholder of Purchaser), and Purchaser have approved this Agreement and resolved that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders, including the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company Board has resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, and, to the extent required by applicable Law, approve 

   ##### 

  

   

the Merger and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), in each case, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and 

   

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and holders (collectively, the " _Company Preferred Stockholders_ ") of 90% or more of the Series D-1 Shares have entered into a preferred stock purchase and voting agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Preferred Stockholder Agreement_ "), pursuant to which each Company Preferred Stockholder has agreed to, among other things, sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser all of such Company Preferred StockholderÂ’s Series D-1 Shares immediately following the time Purchaser purchases Shares in the Offer, a copy of which Preferred Stockholder Agreement is attached as _Annex B_ hereto; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _The Offer_   

  

 SECTION 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with  _Article VII_ and none of the events or circumstances set forth in clause (iii) of _Annex A_ hereto shall have occurred and be existing (and shall not have been waived by Purchaser), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at the Offer Price as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days, after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such ten (10) Business Day deadline to commence the Offer will be extended to such date as the Company is ready to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as the commencement of the Offer. The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (x) the satisfaction of the condition that at the expiration of the Offer there be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn that number of Shares which, when taken together with Shares (if any) then owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, represents more than 50% of the Shares then outstanding determined on a fully-diluted basis (on a "fully-diluted basis" meaning the number of Shares then issued and outstanding _plus_ all shares of Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue as of such date pursuant to options, warrants, convertible securities (other than the shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock owned, beneficially or of record, as of the date hereof, by the Company Preferred Stockholders) or similar obligations regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "), and (y) the satisfaction (or waiver by Purchaser) of the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make any other 

   ##### 

  

   

changes in the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no change
may be made without the prior written consent of the Company which decreases
the price per Share payable in the Offer, changes the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, reduces the maximum number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to, or
modifies or amends, the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, waives the
Minimum Condition or makes any other changes in the terms of the Offer that
are in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or, except as provided
below, extends the expiration date of the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subject to the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, Purchaser may, and at the request of the
Company shall, extend the Offer (i) beyond the initial scheduled expiration
date, which shall be twenty (20) business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1
under the Exchange Act) following the date of commencement of the Offer, or
any subsequent scheduled expiration date, if, at the scheduled expiration of
the Offer, any of the conditions to PurchaserÂ’s obligation to accept for
payment and to pay for Shares tendered shall not be satisfied or, to the
extent permitted by this Agreement, waived and (ii) for any period required
by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer to a date
later than the Outside Date. Each extension of the Offer pursuant to clause
(i) of the preceding sentence shall not exceed ten (10) Business Days (or
such longer period as the Company and Purchaser may agree in writing in any
particular instance) or such fewer number of days that Purchaser reasonably
believes are necessary to cause the conditions of the Offer set forth in 
_Annex A_ hereto to be satisfied. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and
the satisfaction or earlier waiver of all the conditions of the Offer set
forth in _Annex A_  hereto as of any expiration date of the Offer, Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for
all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
after it is permitted to do so under applicable Laws (but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days after such expiration date of the Offer). In
addition, if, at the expiration date of the Offer, all of the conditions to
the Offer have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement,
waived by Purchaser) but the number of Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, when taken together with Shares, if any,
then owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, constitutes less than 90% of the
Shares then outstanding, determined on a fully-diluted basis (as defined in
_Section 1.1(a)_), Purchaser may, or at the CompanyÂ’s request (subject to
applicable Laws) shall, provide for one or more "subsequent offering
periods" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for at least
three (3) but not more than twenty (20) Business Days following the Purchase
Date, in which event Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
(A) give the required notice of such subsequent offering period and (B)
immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares tendered during the
"initial offering period" and immediately accept and promptly pay for all
Shares tendered during any "subsequent offering period," in each case in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. On or prior to the date
that Purchaser becomes obligated to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser the funds necessary
to pay for all Shares that Purchaser becomes so obligated to pay for pursuant
to the Offer. The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, be net to the sellers in cash, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer. The Company agrees that no shares of Company Common
Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered in the
Offer. 

     ##### 

 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by them for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares. In addition, Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel with any comments that Parent or Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and provide the Company with copies of all such responses. 

   

 (c) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer (or in connection with any subsequent offering period) any such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.2 _Company Actions_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") which, subject to  _Section 5.2_, shall contain the Company Recommendation. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company, on the one hand, and each of Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with any comments that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, 

    ##### 

  

    

consult with Parent and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments
and provide Parent with copies of all such responses. 

   

 (b) The Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Purchaser with such additional information, including updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as Parent, Purchaser or their agents may reasonably require in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and files, shall use such information solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_ or if the Offer is otherwise terminated, shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company all copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their possession or in the possession of their agents or representatives. 

   

 (c) The Company grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option (the " _Merger Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Merger Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (after giving effect to the issuance of the Merger Option Shares) for consideration per Merger Option Share equal to the Offer Price;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Merger Option Shares upon the exercise of the Merger Option is subject to the condition that no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Merger Option or the delivery of the Merger Option Shares in respect of such exercise. 

   

 (d) The Merger Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and payment for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer by Parent or Purchaser as a result of which Parent and Purchaser own beneficially at least 80% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The Merger Option shall not be exercisable to the extent that the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto exceeds (x) the number of authorized shares of Company Common Stock available for issuance or (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be issued to Parent and Purchaser without obtaining stockholder approval under the rules of NASDAQ. 

   

 (e) In the event that Parent or Purchaser wish to exercise the Merger Option, Purchaser shall give the Company one (1) Business DayÂ’s prior written notice specifying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately following consummation of the Offer and specifying a place and a time for the closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying the number of Merger Option Shares. At 

    ##### 

  

    

the closing of the purchase of the Merger Option Shares, Parent or Purchaser
shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Merger Option,
multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price, which amount shall be paid in cash (by
wire transfer or cashierÂ’s check) or, at the election of Parent or Purchaser,
by delivery of a promissory note having full recourse to Parent. 

   

 (f) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Merger Option Shares which Parent and Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Merger Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will be upon the purchase of the Merger Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Parent and Purchaser agree that the Merger Option and the Merger Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Merger Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

   

 SECTION 1.3 _Directors of the Company_. 

  

 (a) Upon the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and for so long thereafter as Parent and its Subsidiaries own in the aggregate more than 50% of the outstanding Shares (the " _Board Representation Period_ "), determined on a fully-diluted basis (as defined in  _Section 1.1(a)_), Parent shall be entitled to designate for appointment or election to the Company Board, upon written notice to the Company, such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, as is equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence) by the percentage that the number of Shares so owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts, subject to compliance with applicable securities Laws and applicable rules of the NASDAQ Global Market (" _NASDAQ_ "), to promptly cause ParentÂ’s designees (and any replacement designees in the event that any designee shall no longer be on the Company Board) to be so appointed or elected to the Company Board and, in furtherance thereof, to the extent necessary, use its reasonable best efforts to increase the size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of such number of its directors as is necessary to give effect to the foregoing provision. During the Board Representation Period, subject to  _Section 1.3(c)_, the Company will cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute such number of members of each committee of the Company Board, rounded up to the next whole number, that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board, other than any committee established to take action under this Agreement which committee shall be composed only of Independent Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least two (2) directors who are directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ for the avoidance of doubt, the director elected by the holders of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock, pursuant to Section A.8 of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation may constitute an Independent Director for purposes of this _Section 1.3(a)_; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below two (2) for any reason whatsoever (or if immediately following 

    ##### 

  

    

consummation of the Offer there are not at least two (2) then-existing
directors of the Company who are (A) Qualified Persons and (B) willing to
serve as Independent Directors), then the number of Independent
Directors required hereunder shall be one (1), unless the remaining
Independent Director is able to identify a person who is not then an officer
or Affiliate of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(any such person being referred to herein as a " _Qualified Person_ "; it
being understood that, for purposes of this definition, a person that would
otherwise not be considered an Affiliate of the Company shall not be deemed
an Affiliate of the Company solely because he or she is a director of the
Company), willing to serve as an Independent Director, in which case
such remaining Independent Director shall be entitled to designate any such
Qualified Person to fill such vacancy, and such designated Qualified Person
shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement,
or if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall be
required to designate two (2) Qualified Persons to fill such vacancies, and
such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under  _Section 1.3(a)_, including mailing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9 if it receives from Parent and Purchaser the information below on a basis timely to permit such mailing) as is necessary to fulfill the CompanyÂ’s obligations under _Section 1.3(a)_. The CompanyÂ’s obligation to appoint ParentÂ’s designees to the Company Board pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and to ParentÂ’s compliance with its obligations under the following sentence. Parent and Purchaser shall supply the Company such information with respect to Parent and Purchaser and their nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary in connection with the appointment of any of ParentÂ’s designees under _Section 1.3(a)_, and Parent and Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of such information. 

   

 (c) Following the election or appointment of ParentÂ’s designees pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of the Independent Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one (1) Independent Director then in office, the Independent Director) (the " _Independent Director Approval_ ") shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other committee thereof or any other director of the Company, shall, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, be required or permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension by the Company of time for performance of any obligation or action under this Agreement by Parent or Purchaser, (iii) any waiver, exercise or enforcement of any of the CompanyÂ’s rights under this Agreement, (iv) any other action by the Company which could adversely affect the interests of the stockholders of the Company (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates) or (v) any amendment of the Company Charter Documents. The Independent Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel and other advisors at the expense of the Company as are reasonably appropriate to the exercise of their duties in connection with this Agreement, subject to approval by the Company of the terms of such retention, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In 

    ##### 

  

    

addition, the Independent Directors shall have the authority to institute any
action, on behalf of the Company, to enforce performance of this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 1.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable following the acceptance for payment of Shares by Parent or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Offer on the Purchase Date (the " _Acceptance Time_ ") (or, if later, following the termination of the subsequent offering period, if any), if required by applicable Law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents: 

   

 (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of the Company Stockholders and the holders of Series D-1 Preferred Stock (the " _Series D-1 Holders_") for the purposes of considering and taking action upon the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "); and

Parent shall provide the Company with such information with respect to Parent and its Affiliates as shall be required to be included in the Proxy Statement. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.4(a)_, in the event that Parent, Purchaser and any of ParentÂ’s other Subsidiaries shall acquire in the aggregate at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto shall, subject to _Article VI_, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. 

   

 (c) Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the shares of capital stock of the Company acquired in the Offer or pursuant to the Preferred Stockholder Agreement or otherwise then owned by it, Purchaser or any of ParentÂ’s other Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting or in order to take the actions required by  _Section 1.4(b)_. 

   

 SECTION 1.5 _Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement_. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, whenever any party hereto becomes aware of any event or change which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and/or the Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the other parties thereof and each of the parties shall cooperate in the preparation, filing with the SEC and (as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws and rules and 

   ##### 

  

 

regulations promulgated thereunder) dissemination to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders of such amendment or supplement.

 _The Merger_   

  

 SECTION 2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 SECTION 2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (or, if applicable, a certificate of ownership and merger) executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 SECTION 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (but subject to  _Section 5.7_). 

  

 SECTION 2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. 

  

 (a) The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 2.7 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of Purchaser or the Company: 

  

 (a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Purchaser shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) Any shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares or Series D-1 Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser, any other Subsidiary of Parent or a Subsidiary of the Company shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) Each (i) Share (other than (x) Shares to be canceled in accordance with  _Section 2.7(b)_ and (y) any Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Offer Price payable upon surrender, in the manner provided in this Agreement, to the holder of the certificate formerly representing such Share, without interest and (ii) Series D-1 Share (other than (x) Series D-1 Shares to be canceled in accordance with  _Section 2.7(b)_ and (y) any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such Series D-1 Shares are convertible pursuant to and in accordance with Section A.5 of the Series D-1 Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation multiplied by the Offer Price payable upon surrender, in the manner provided in this Agreement, to the holder of the certificate formerly representing such Series D-1 Share, without interest (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such Shares and Series D-1 Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares or such Series D-1 Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with this Agreement, without interest. 

   

 (d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Shares), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Shares, occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 SECTION 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Shares and the holders of Series D-1 Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to 

    ##### 

  

    

receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of
holders of Shares and the holders of Series D-1 Shares, the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares and holders of Series D-1 Shares
shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_. Parent shall
deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior
to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the
Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by
the Paying Agent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
(iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either MoodyÂ’s Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Ratings Services or (iv) money market
funds investing solely in a combination of the foregoing. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of,
and shall be paid to, Parent. Parent shall promptly replace any funds
deposited with the Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to
this paragraph. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (or evidence of shares in book-entry form), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Series D-1 Shares (the " _Series D-1 Certificates_"), whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates and the Series D-1 Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates and the Series D-1 Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agentÂ’s message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and the Series D-1 Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate or a Series D-1 Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or such Series D-1 Certificate, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (less any applicable excise and withholding Taxes in accordance with  _Section 2.8(g)_), without interest, for each Share formerly represented by such Certificate or each Series D-1 Share formerly represented by such Series D-1 Certificate, as applicable, and the Certificate or Series D-1 Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Series D-1 Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate or Series D-1 Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Series D-1 Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.8_, each

##### 

 

  

Certificate and Series D-1 Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect thereto as contemplated by this _Article II_,
without interest. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares or Series D-1 Shares upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Series D-1 Certificates, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this  _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates or the Series D-1 Shares previously represented by such Series D-1 Certificate, as applicable, and at the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares or the Series D-1 Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and holders of Series D-1 Certificates that evidenced ownership of Series D-1 Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of  _Section 2.8(e)_, if, at any time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Series D-1 Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_. 

   

 (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate or Series D-1 Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate or such Series D-1 Certificate, as applicable, to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate or such Series D-1 Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate or Series D-1 Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares formerly represented thereby, as contemplated by this _Article II_. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following six (6) months after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or holders of Series D-1 Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or Series D-1 Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares, Company Options or Series D-1 Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Company Options or Series D-1 Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 SECTION 2.9 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares and Series D-1 Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such Dissenting StockholderÂ’s Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such Share or Series D-1 Share, in accordance with _Section 2.7(c)_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares or Series D-1 Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholdersÂ’ rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 SECTION 2.10 _Company Options_. Prior to the Purchase Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall be terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive, in full satisfaction of such Company Option, a cash 

   ##### 

  

 

amount equal to the Option Consideration (if any) for each share of Company
Common Stock then subject to the Company Option. The Option Consideration
shall be paid within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Option Consideration otherwise payable such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ "
means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under
a particular Company Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i)
the Offer Price over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share
of Company Common Stock issuable under such Company Option rounded down to
the nearest cent. As of the Effective Time, any Option with an exercise price
equal to or greater than the Offer Price shall be canceled without
consideration and be of no further force or effect. The Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to
effect the foregoing. Any Company Options held by any director of the
Company that do not vest and are thereby cancelled as a result of such
directorÂ’s resignation pursuant to the provisions of _Section 1.3(a)_ shall
nevertheless be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of the payments to be
made in respect of Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) pursuant to this
_Section 2.10_. 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_   

  

 The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser that except as set forth in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") or the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") (excluding all exhibits, annexes and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein or any risk factors or forward-looking statements and any other disclosures therein to the extent they are predictive or forward-looking in nature) (it being understood that any matter set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter or in such Filed Company SEC Documents shall be deemed disclosed for all sections and subsections of this Agreement only to the extent that the applicability of such disclosure to such section or subsection is readily apparent): 

   

 SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. 

  

 (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased or held under license by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any change, event, occurrence, state of facts or 

     ##### 

  

    

development which has a material adverse effect on (1) the business, results
of operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole or (2) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the Outside Date; _provided_ that with respect to clause (1)
above, Company Material Adverse Effect shall not include any changes, events,
occurrences, state of facts or developments, to the extent arising out of or
resulting from (i) changes after the date of this Agreement in conditions
generally in the United States or global economy or in the capital or
financial markets, including changes in interest or exchange rates, (ii)
changes after the date of this Agreement in general legal, regulatory,
political, economic or business conditions or changes in generally accepted
accounting principles that, in either case, generally affect the industry in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business, (iii) the
negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including the impact thereof on
relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers,
suppliers, distributors, partners, collaborators or employees, (iv) acts of
war, sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts
of war, sabotage or terrorism threatened or underway as of the date of this
Agreement, (v) storms, earthquakes or other natural disasters, (vi) the
initiation of any litigation by any stockholder of the Company relating to
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, (vii) any decline in the market
price, or change in trading volume, of the Company Common Stock or any
failure of the Company to meet publicly announced revenue or earnings
projections;  _provided_ that the underlying changes, events, occurrences,
state of facts or developments that caused or contributed to any such
decline, change or failure may otherwise be taken into consideration in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, (viii)
any delay after the date of this Agreement in any of the CompanyÂ’s ongoing
research programs resulting from any adverse changes, developments,
circumstances, events or occurrences, or (ix) any action taken by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries which is expressly required by this Agreement
or that has been expressly consented to by Parent under the terms of this
Agreement, except in each of cases (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and
(vii), to the extent that such changes affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries in a disproportionate manner relative to other participants in
the businesses and industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate. 

   

 (b) Each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries is a corporation or other organization duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization.

Takeover Proposal. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to,

negotiations with any Person previously conducted with respect to any
Takeover Proposal, and will request, to the extent permitted under the

be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.2_ by the Company. 

   

 (b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.2(b)_, the Company Board shall not (i)(A) withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or (B) adopt, recommend or propose publicly to adopt or recommend, to the Company Stockholders a Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood and agreed that (x) any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) any change or development relating to any clinical trial of one or more products or product candidates of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any determination or communication by the FDA or any other Governmental Authority relating thereto will not be a basis for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change), or (ii) authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or merger, acquisition or similar agreement with respect to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in  _Section 5.2(a)_) (each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time and subject to the proviso of this sentence: (x) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, and (y) if the Company Board receives a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board reasonably determines (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal, and that was unsolicited after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a material breach of this _Section 5.2_, the Company or its Subsidiaries may enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Company shall have complied with the provisions of the following sentence and, immediately prior to entering into such Company Acquisition Agreement, terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and paid the Termination Fee and Expense Payment pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless: (1) the Company has provided to Parent five (5) Business Days prior written notice (an " _Alternative Transaction Notice_ "), which Alternative Transaction Notice shall specify that the Company Board is prepared to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, terminate this Agreement pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

   

 _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or enter into any Company Acquisition
Agreement unless: (1) the Company has provided to Parent five (5) Business
Days prior written notice (an " _Alternative Transaction Notice_ "), which
Alternative Transaction Notice shall specify that the Company Board is
prepared to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and/or enter into any
Company Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and, in the case of a Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board has determined constitutes a Superior
Proposal, shall attach the most current version of any written agreement
relating to such Takeover Proposal and advising Parent that the Company Board
has determined that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that
the Company Board intends to enter into an agreement providing for such
Superior Proposal, (2) during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested
by Parent, the Company has engaged in good-faith negotiations with Parent
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Takeover Proposal that was
determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal
and (3) at 5:00 p.m., New York time, at the end of the fifth (5th) Business
Day following the date of receipt of the Alternative Transaction Notice (or,
in the event that the Takeover Proposal has been materially revised
or modified, at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day
following the date of receipt of notice of such material revision or
modification, if later), such Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account all changes
to the terms of this Agreement agreed to by Parent). It is understood and
agreed that an Alternative Transaction Notice shall be required for a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, regardless of whether it was made in
response to or as a result of a Superior Proposal. 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_ and  _5.2(b)_ , the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after learning of the relevant information) advise Parent in writing of its receipt of any Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes to material terms of such Takeover Proposal) and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and material terms (including any change to the material terms of such Takeover Proposal) of any Takeover Proposal, and shall provide Parent with copies of all Takeover Proposals (and amendments or material modifications of such Takeover Proposals) and related agreements, draft agreements exchanged by the parties and modifications thereof.

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days hereafter) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section 5.3_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable; and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. 

   

 (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this  _Section 5.3_, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the Transactions. Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent shall take such actions as shall be necessary to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions on or before the Outside Date, including by defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) in each case, as may be required in order to obtain any approvals from any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any Action or Proceeding, which would 

    ##### 

  

    

otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by either Parent
or the Company to consummate the Transactions, in no event shall Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept
any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to take
any action (i) the effectiveness or consummation of which is not
conditional on the consummation of the Offer and the Merger or (ii) that
individually or in the aggregate is or would be reasonably expected to result
in a material diminution of the benefits of the Transactions to Parent (with
materiality, for purposes of this provision, being measured in relation to the
size of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole) (any such action,
undertaking, condition or other restriction, a " _Materially Burdensome
Condition_ "). The Company shall agree, if requested by Parent in writing, to
commit to take any of the foregoing actions with respect to the assets or
business of the Company in furtherance of this _Section 5.3_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such action may be conditioned upon the consummation of
the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions. 

   

 SECTION 5.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except as expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with or other requirement of NASDAQ as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation with the other party to the extent reasonably practicable). 

  

 SECTION 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to Parent and ParentÂ’s Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers, employees, accountants, properties, books, Contracts and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) other information concerning the business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) breach any agreement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any third party, (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Laws or (iv) which would result in a competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receiving material information which is competitively sensitive; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents for the disclosure of such information or documents and take such other action (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential information or entry into a joint defense agreement or 

   ##### 

  

 

other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client privilege) with respect
to such information or documents as is necessary to permit disclosure to
Parent and ParentÂ’s Representatives. Until the Effective Time, the
information provided pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2007, between
Parent, the record and beneficial owner of all of the outstanding capital
stock of Parent, and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the

Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall give reasonably prompt written notice to Parent of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, after the date of this Agreement, of any fact or event which has caused or would be reasonably likely (i) to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) to cause any covenant, condition or agreement (other than any covenant or agreement of Parent or Purchaser) under this Agreement (including the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto) not to be complied with or satisfied and (b) any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect, any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the Company hereunder (including the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto);  _provided_ that no such notification shall affect the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article III_ or the conditions to the obligations of Parent or Purchaser hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From the Acceptance Time until the Effective Time Parent shall cause (including by providing adequate funding) the Company to, and after the Effective Time Parent shall cause (including by providing adequate funding) the Surviving Corporation to, assume the obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") as provided in the Company Charter Documents or any written indemnification Contract between such directors or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement), without further action, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, for a period of at least six (6) years after the Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (or any successor) to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter 

    ##### 

  

    

Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. Parent shall cause (including by providing adequate funding to)
the Surviving Corporation to, honor all of its indemnification obligations
existing as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Acceptance Time, Parent shall maintain in effect directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who were or are currently (and any additional persons who at or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies on terms with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such individuals than those of such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that any substitution or replacement of existing policies shall not result in any gaps or lapses of coverage with respect to facts, events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time)); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed 200% of the current aggregate annual premiums, then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at the sum of (i) an annual premium of 200% of the current aggregate annual premiums plus (ii) the unearned portion of the premium paid by the Company for the current year for such insurance. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and, in addition to, and not in substitution for, and shall not impair any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract, under the Company Charter Documents, or the comparable organization documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, under applicable Law, or otherwise. Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with all of its obligations under this _Section 5.7_. 

   

 SECTION 5.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Section 7.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated;  _provided_ that the fees and expenses of printing and mailing the Offer Documents, all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Offer and the Merger and all filing fees and other out of pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 5.3, shall be reimbursed by Parent to the Company or such Subsidiary in the event that this Agreement is terminated by (a) the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7(b)(i)_,  _Section 7(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7(b)(iii)_ or (b) the Company pursuant to _Section 7(d)(i)_ and, in any case, at the time of such termination any applicable period under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated. 

  

 SECTION 5.9 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3

   ##### 

  

 

promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action
Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

 

 SECTION 5.10 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall, for a period of one (1) year immediately following the later of the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, employees who shall have been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Acceptance Time who continue as employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation following the Acceptance Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") with employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (other than equity-based plans and severance arrangements) that are comparable, in the aggregate, to the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements (other than equity-based plans and severance arrangements) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to Company Employees immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. Parent shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Acceptance Time as service with Parent and its Affiliates in connection with any Parent Benefit Plan which is made available to Company Employees following the Acceptance Time for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement where length of service is relevant. Parent shall (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees and their dependents under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made available to Company Employees following the Acceptance Time (other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees as of the Acceptance Time under the analogous Company Plan), and (ii) provide credit to Company Employees and their dependents for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year, including the Purchase Date. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to expressly assume and agree to perform any employment, severance or change in control agreement listed in _Section 3.11(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries would be required to perform it if the Transactions had not taken place. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall honor, and cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, the 2008 Severance Pay Plan for the benefit of Company Employees. 

   

 (b) This _Section 5.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Article V_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.10_. 

   

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Company Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan in accordance with its terms, or interfere with the right or obligation of Parent or its Affiliates to make such changes as are necessary to conform with 

    ##### 

  

    

applicable Law (including without limitation Section 409A of the Code); or
(iii) limit the right of Parent or any of its Affiliates to terminate the
employment of any employee at any time. 

   

 (d) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any Company Compensation Arrangements for Covered Stockholders, the Company intends that all such amounts payable under such Company Compensation Arrangements (i) shall be paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered Stockholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered Stockholders. If there has been any adoption, approval, amendment or modification of any Company Compensation Arrangement, either prior to or after the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that, upon the request of Parent, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, consisting solely of independent directors, shall approve resolutions approving such adoption, approval, amendment or modification as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangements, in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto.

Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from the NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 5.12 _Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (b) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions. 

  

 SECTION 5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, which prior to the Acceptance Time shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 (c) Purchaser shall have purchased all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Purchaser may invoke this condition if Purchaser shall have failed to purchase Shares so tendered and not withdrawn in violation of the terms of this Agreement or the Offer.

 (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party if the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before the Outside Date was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; 

   

 (ii) if any Restraint enjoining, restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Transactions or making the consummation of the Transactions illegal shall be in effect and shall have become final and non appealable;  _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.l(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final, non

appealable Restraint was primarily due to the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or 

   

 (iii) if the Offer shall have expired or been terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement without Parent or Purchaser having accepted for purchase any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, other than due to a breach of this Agreement by the terminating party; or 

   

(c) by Parent, prior to the Acceptance Time: 

   

 (i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would result in any of the events set forth in clause (c) or (d) of _Annex A_ to occur and (B) is not cured, or cannot be cured, by the Company within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from Parent (or if the Outside Date is less than thirty (30) calendar days from the notice by Parent, is not cured, or cannot be cured, by the Company by the Outside Date); or

Accordingly, in the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or Expense Payment when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses incurred or accrued by it (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this _Section 7.3_ with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee and/or Expense Payment, as the case may be, from the date that such payment was required to be made until the date of actual payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., in effect on the date that such payment was required to be made.

 _Miscellaneous_   

  

 SECTION 8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. The representations and warranties contained herein or in any other writing delivered pursuant hereto, as well as any covenant or agreement of the parties that by its terms contemplates performance exclusively prior to the Effective Time, shall survive until (but not beyond) the Effective Time.

 SECTION 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after the Company Stockholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto upon action taken by their respective Boards of Directors (which in the case of the Company after the Acceptance Time shall include the Independent Director Approval contemplated by _Section 1.3_); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that following receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange would require further approval by any of the stockholders of the Company without such approval. 

  

 SECTION 8.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Purchaser in exercising any right hereunder shall 

   ##### 

  

 

operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. 

   

 SECTION 8.4 _Assignment_.

Any purported assignment not permitted under this section shall be null and void.

ARTICLE VII  

  

 _Miscellanous_   

  

 Section 7.1. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.  

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to Contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) All Actions or Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court (and, in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action or Proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Action or Proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action or Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. 

   

 (c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement.

Therefore, each Company Preferred Stockholder agrees that Parent shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief (without the requirement to post bond) as a court of competent jurisdiction may deem necessary or appropriate to restrain such Company Preferred Stockholder, as the case may be, from committing any violation of such covenants, obligations or agreements and to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement. These injunctive remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies Parent may have under applicable law. 

  

 Section 7.3. _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by a party without the prior consent of the other parties, and any attempt to so assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement without such consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its sole discretion, assign or transfer all or any of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent from its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon the respective heirs, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other than the parties hereto and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be a third party beneficiary of 

   ##### 

  

    

the obligations of the parties to this Agreement and shall be entitled to
enforce those obligations as though a party hereto. 

  

 Section 7.4. _Amendments, Waivers, etc_. Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended other than by an instrument in writing signed by Parent, Purchaser and the Company Preferred Stockholders. No provision of this Agreement may be waived, discharged or terminated other than by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom the enforcement of such waiver, discharge or termination is sought, except that this Agreement may be terminated as set forth in _Section 6.1_.
