whole or in part, in a manner that will comply with the requirements of a like-kind
exchange (&#147;Like-Kind Exchange&#148;) pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#147;Code&#148;). If Seller so elects, Seller may
assign its rights under this Agreement to the Section 1031 Assets to the QI. Buyer hereby
(i) consents to Seller&#146;s assignment of its rights in this Agreement with respect to
the Section 1031 Assets, and (ii) if such an assignment is made, agrees to pay all or a
portion of the Purchase Price into the qualified trust account at Closing as directed in
writing by Seller. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that a whole or partial
assignment of this Agreement to a QI shall not release either Party from any of its
respective liabilities and obligations to each other or expand any such respective
liabilities or obligations under this Agreement. Neither Party represents to the other
that any particular tax treatment will be given to either Party as a result of the
Like-Kind Exchange. The Party not participating in the Like-Kind Exchange shall not be
obligated to pay any additional costs or incur any additional obligations in its sale of
the Assets if such costs are the result of the other Party&#146;s Like-Kind Exchange, and
the Party participating in the Like-Kind Exchange shall hold harmless and indemnify the
other Party from and against all claims, losses and liabilities (including reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees, court costs and related expenses), if any, resulting from such a
Like-Kind Exchange.  </FONT></P>

assurances of reasonable financial conditions, but Buyer           shall not be required

Environmental Defect Notices for any environmental matters which constitute an
Environmental Defect and which arose (a) on or before August 1, 2005 must be received by

The right to assert Environmental Defects after the Environmental Defect Date shall not
apply to matters which could have been asserted prior to such date regardless of whether
or not they were known or discovered as of such time. For the purpose of this section,
&#147;substantiation for the Environmental Defect&#148; shall mean reports prepared by, or
the basis of Phase I or Phase II tests performed by the Environmental Consultant. If Buyer
at any time prior to October 2, 2005, desires to conduct a Phase II or other test
involving invasive testing, including digging or coring, then Seller may in its sole
discretion elect to terminate this Agreement as to such Asset upon which such Phase II or
other tests are proposed to occur from this transaction shall be considered Excluded
Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value for such Asset. If
Buyer takes any samples from the Assets, Buyer will provide to Seller a splitting of each
sample. Buyer will deliver, at its cost, copies of all drafts and final reports, results,
data, and analyses of the site visits, inspections and any testing to Seller within three
business days of Buyer&#146;s receipt of them. </FONT></P>

October 2, 2005 and before Seller has completed remediation of a           Environmental
Defect, if a leak, spill, or discharge of any material or           substance (&#147;Occurrence&#148;)
occurs on the Assets, or any part of them,           the party in possession will
promptly notify the non-possessory party and act           promptly to minimize the
effects of the Occurrence. If a spill, leak or           discharge occurs and Seller
determines that it may affect the area where Seller           is conducting remediation
or assessment, Buyer will hire a consultant (who must           be acceptable to Seller)
to assess the effect of the Occurrence on the           environmental condition of the
Assets and Seller&#146;s remediation work and the           cost of the additional work
required as the result of the Occurrence. Unless the           Occurrence was caused
solely by Seller, Buyer will be responsible for the           incremental cost of
remediating the impact of the Occurrence. If Seller&#146;s           remediation is
expanded to incorporate remediation of the Occurrence, Buyer will           promptly pay
its share of costs and expenses to Seller as the work is performed,           within
thirty days of receipt of invoices for the work (with supporting
          documentation). Payments not made timely will bear interest at a rate of twelve
          percent per annum or the maximum lawful rate, whichever is less, compounded
          daily from the date of Buyer&#146;s receipt of the invoice until paid.  </FONT></P>

the cost of the additional work equals or exceeds the cost which would have been incurred
but for the Occurrence, Seller will pay Buyer the cost that would have been incurred by
Seller to complete the remediation but for the Occurrence. As consideration for this
payment, Buyer will accept the environmental condition of the Assets as they exist on the
date of the payment, assume full responsibility for remediating the Assets and related
off-site contamination in accordance with this Agreement, and agree to release, not to
sue, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Seller, its members, partners, owners, officers,
directors, employees and agents (&#147;Indemnified Seller&#148;) as to claims and
liabilities arising from the Occurrence to the same extent as described in Article 15. </FONT></P>

amount from the other working interest owners, Buyer will refund to Seller,
          within sixty days of each Seller invoice, with documentation, any amounts
          expended by Seller over the amount formerly attributable to Seller&#146;s

liability to Buyer with respect to operation of an Asset greater than that
          which it might have as the operator to a non-operator under the applicable

fact, matter, circumstance or event after the date hereof but prior           to the
Closing (a &#147;Post-Signing Event&#148;), requiring supplementation or
          amendment of Seller&#146;s Exhibits or Schedules attached to this Agreement,
          supplement or amend such Exhibits or Schedules to reflect any Post-Signing
          Event, which, if existing, occurring or known on the date of this Agreement,
          would have been required to be set forth or described in such Exhibits or
          Schedules EXCEPT AND EXCLUDING (a) changes resulting from general economic,
          financial or market conditions, (b) the taking of any action by any
governmental           entity in respect of monetary or fiscal affairs, or (c) the
announcement of the           execution of this Agreement (&#147;Exhibit Revisions&#148;,
or &#147;Exhibit           Revision&#148; in the singular form). All supplements and
amendments to the           Exhibits or Schedules provided by the Seller shall (i) amend
or supplement the           representations and warranties (and corresponding Exhibits
and Schedules) made           as of the date hereof and (ii) shall be given effect for
the purpose of           determining (A) satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article 11 of this           Agreement and (B) compliance by the Seller with its
covenants, representations,           warranties and agreements set forth herein. If any
Exhibit Revision creates a           Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) and Buyer
has asserted such Material           Adverse Effect in writing to Seller by Closing,
Buyer and Seller shall equally           bear the actual costs resulting from the facts
or circumstances of such Exhibit           Revision. Any disputes as to the existence or
amount of any asserted Material           Adverse Effect shall be submitted to
arbitration pursuant to Section 15.6. Said           adjustment shall be made at Closing
pursuant to Section 3.4 if actual costs are           known by Closing. Any further
adjustments after Closing shall be made between           the parties after Buyer has
submitted an invoice and adequate support for such           actual costs and Seller
shall promptly pay the amount of such adjustment to           Buyer. Buyer may use
reasonable estimates when asserting a Material Adverse           Effect but if the actual
costs for the asserted Material Adverse Effect are less           than or equal to Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), then no Material Adverse           Effect shall exist
as to such Exhibit Revision. As used herein, &#147;Material           Adverse Effect&#148; means
with respect to each Exhibit Revision, when used in           connection with Seller, a
material adverse effect (which exceeds Ten Million           Dollars ($10,000,000.00)) on
the Assets or on the business, financial condition           or results of operations of
Seller taken as a whole. Any third party claims           underlying the amount of any
Material Adverse Effect may not be settled by Buyer           without Seller&#146;s prior
written approval. If the cause underlying the           Exhibit Revision is, or results
in, suits or legal, equitable, arbitrative or           administrative proceeding
(collectively, &#147;Lawsuit&#148;), Buyer shall           endeavor to give written
notice of such Lawsuit to Seller as soon as is           practicable. If Seller or its
counsel so requests, Buyer shall furnish Seller           with copies of all pleadings
and other information with respect to such Lawsuit.           At the election of Seller
made within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such           notice, Buyer shall permit
Seller to assume control of such Lawsuit, including           the determination of all
appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on           behalf of Buyer, and the
conduct of litigation through attorneys of           Seller&#146;s choice; provided,
however, that any settlement of the Lawsuit by           Seller may not result in any
liability or cost to Buyer without its prior           written consent. If Seller elects
to assume control, (i) any expense incurred by           Buyer thereafter for
investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by           Buyer, and (ii) Seller
shall give all reasonable information and assistance,           other than pecuniary,
that Buyer shall deem necessary to the proper defense of           such Lawsuit.  </FONT></P>

          Buyer, in its sole discretion, may extend an offer of employment commencing on

than fifty           (50) miles from Midland, Texas; (B) for base salary or hourly wage
at least           equal to the employee&#146;s regular base salary or hourly wage level
in effect           for such employee as of the Effective Time; (C) that such employee
shall keep           substantially the same job title and responsibilities that such
employee had           with Seller as of the Effective Time as set forth on Schedule
9.1(m)(i), and           that such employee shall be entitled to participate in any
benefit programs and           incentive plans applicable to similarly situated employees
of Buyer or WPC on           the same basis as such benefits and plans are customarily
made available by           Buyer or WPC from time to time, including without limitation
all employee           retirement, bonus, insurance, vacation, sick leave, long-term
disability and           other benefit programs, and any option or other equity incentive
plans, as such           benefits and plans may be modified, amended or terminated from
time to time, and           such other terms and conditions as set forth in Section
9.1(n) below; (D) that           such employee agrees and acknowledges that he or she is
not entitled to receive           any additional consideration from Seller, including but
not limited to payments           for compensation or accrued but unused vacation or any
other benefits; (E) that           in the event such employee voluntarily terminates his

hereinafter defined)           prior to the one (1) year anniversary of such employment

Bonus; and (F) that in the           event such employee&#146;s employment is terminated
by Buyer other than for           &#147;cause&#148; at any time prior to the one (1) year

entitled to           receive the full amount of the Retention Bonus and any severance
payable under           benefit plans or programs then maintained by Buyer for the
benefit of its           employees. As used herein, &#147;cause&#148; shall mean the

any such case in which an offer of employment is extended by Buyer, Seller
          agrees that the payment of any retention bonus (the &#147;Retention
          Bonuses&#148;) by Buyer to such employee shall be conditioned upon the
          employee&#146;s acceptance of Buyer&#146;s offer of employment and remaining an
          employee of Buyer for a period of not less than one (1) year from the date such
          employment commences in order to be paid such bonus. The total amount of
          Retention Bonus payable by Buyer to each employee is set forth on Schedule
          9.1(m)(ii). The total amount of Retention Bonuses payable to employees that
          accept Buyer&#146;s offer of employment shall constitute a downward adjustment
          to the Purchase Price at Closing. Following Closing, Buyer shall be responsible
          for the payment of such Retention Bonuses, shall pay the applicable Retention
          Bonuses on the one (1) year anniversary of the date of employment of such
          employee with Buyer, and shall indemnify Seller from and against any liability
          for its failure to properly pay Retention Bonuses. Seller will, at its
          discretion and/or subject to certain employment agreements, pay certain
          employees on Schedule 9.1(m)(ii) bonuses in addition to the Retention Bonuses.
          For a period of one (1) year following Closing, Seller agrees not to hire any
of           the individuals listed on Schedule 9.1(m)(ii) that receive and accept
employment           offers from Buyer. During the period beginning one (1) year
following Closing           and ending two (2) years following the Closing, Seller agrees
not to initiate           contact with any of the individuals listed on Schedule
9.1(m)(ii) that receive           and accept employment offers from Buyer for the purpose
of hiring or offering to           hire such individual; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit           Seller from hiring, offering to hire or otherwise
communicating with any such           individual if such individual initiates such
discussions with Seller.           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement including the payment           of any Retention Bonus, the employees hired by
Buyer pursuant to this Section           9.1(m) shall be entitled to participate in and
receive the benefits of any           severance plan of WPC or Buyer as then in effect.  </FONT></P>

Further, for           purposes of the preceding sentence, Buyer shall deem any Hired
Employee to have           not less than three (3) years of service with Buyer from the

as may be           necessary to correct any statements or omissions if, at the time when
a           prospectus relating to such securities is required to be delivered under the
          Securities Act, any event shall have occurred as the result of which any such
          prospectus or any other prospectus or prospectus supplement as then in effect
          would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
          material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
          circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, (v) advise the Seller,

          issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of the
          Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for
          that purpose and promptly use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent
the           issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order

of the           Registration Statement, prospectus (preliminary and final) and such
other           documents as the Seller may reasonably request to facilitate the sale of
such           securities. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in connection with the

          prior written notice to Seller to suspend sales of WPC Shares under the
          Registration Statement for up to two (2) non-consecutive 60-day periods if WPC
          determines in good faith that such sales would materially delay or interfere
          with any pending financing, acquisition, corporate restructuring or other
          transaction involving WPC or its subsidiaries or would require WPC to disclose
          material nonpublic information. The Seller shall cooperate with all reasonable
          requests by WPC necessary to effectuate any post-effective amendment or
          amendments to the Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus

If the Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or legal           action that may
result in a Loss for which indemnification may be sought under           this Article 15
(a &#147;Claim&#148;), the Indemnified Party shall endeavor to           give written
notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party as soon as is           practicable. If
the Indemnifying Party or its counsel so requests, the           Indemnified Party shall
furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all           pleadings and other
information with respect to such Claim. At the election of           the Indemnifying
Party made within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice,           the Indemnified
Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of           such Claim (to
the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter           relates to a Loss
for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the           determination of all
appropriate actions, the negotiation of settlements on           behalf of the
Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys           of the
Indemnifying Party&#146;s choice; provided, however, that any settlement           of the
Claim by the Indemnifying Party may not result in any liability or cost           to the
Indemnified Party without its prior written consent. If the Indemnifying           Party
elects to assume control, (i) any expense incurred by the Indemnified           Party
thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter shall be borne by           the
Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable
          information and assistance, other than pecuniary, that the Indemnifying Party
          shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim. In the absence of
such           an election, the Indemnified Party will use its best efforts to defend, at
the           Indemnifying Party&#146;s expense, any claim, legal action or other matter
to           which such other Party&#146;s indemnification under this Article&nbsp;15
applies           until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense. If the Indemnifying
Party           fails to assume such defense within the time period provided above, the
          Indemnified Party may settle the Claim, in its reasonable discretion at the
          Indemnifying Party&#146;s expense. If such a Claim requires immediate action,
          both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good
          faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim
          or either Party&#146;s position with respect to such Claim.  </FONT></P>

conducted as follows: the arbitration proceeding shall be submitted by the parties to a
panel of three independent and impartial arbitrators with knowledge or experience in the
oil and gas industry, one selected by each of the parties within thirty days after said
written notice and a third selected by the first two arbitrators (each an &#147;Arbitrator,&#148; and
collectively the &#147;Arbitrators&#148;). The third Arbitrator, selected by the first
two Arbitrators, shall be a person having substantial experience and recognized expertise
in oil and gas industry. The arbitration shall be conducted according to procedures
established by agreement of the parties or the arbitration panel. At the hearing, the
parties shall present such evidence and witnesses as they may choose, with or without
counsel. Adherence to formal rules of evidence shall not be required but the arbitration
panel shall consider any evidence and testimony that it determines to be relevant, in
accordance with procedures that it determines to be appropriate. Any award entered in the
arbitration shall be made by a written opinion stating the reasons and basis for the
award made and any payment due pursuant to the arbitration shall be made within fifteen
(15) days of the Arbitrators&#146; decision. The final decision may be filed in a court
of competent jurisdiction and may be enforced by Buyer or Seller as a final judgment of
such court. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses of the arbitration,
provided, however, that the costs of employing the Arbitrators shall be borne 50% by the
Seller and 50% by the Buyer.  </FONT></P>
