date of the Merger will be 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date
(the "Effective Time").

  

  

  

Section 1.2 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of

and time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing.

  

  

  

Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. As of the Effective Time, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving such Merger (the "Surviving Company"). The parties acknowledge and
agree that (a) the Merger shall be effected so as to constitute a "merger" as
such term is understood under the Companies Act and (b) the Surviving Company
shall be deemed to be a "surviving company" in accordance with Section 104H of
the Companies Act. Pursuant to Section 109(2) of the Companies Act, from and
after the Effective Time: (i) the Merger of the Company and Merger Sub and the
vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in the Surviving
Company shall become effective; (ii) the Surviving Company shall continue to
be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of the Company and
Merger Sub; (iii) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to
prosecution shall be unaffected; (iv) any civil, criminal or administrative
action or proceeding pending by or against the Company or Merger Sub may be
continued to be prosecuted by or against the Surviving Company; (v) a
conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of or against, the

(vi) the Certificate of Merger shall be deemed to be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company; (vii) the Registrar shall strike off
the register Merger Sub; and (viii) the cessation of Merger Sub shall not be a

Section 1.4 Surviving Company Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws. At the
Effective Time, the memorandum of association and the bye-laws of the
Surviving Company shall be the form of memorandum of association and the bye-
laws which are attached hereto as Exhibit C and Exhibit D, respectively (as
they may be amended or modified from time to time after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written agreement of the parties).

  

  

  

Section 1.5 Directors. The parties to this Agreement shall take all requisite
action so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the directors of the
Surviving Company until their successors are duly elected and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the bye-
laws of the Surviving Company and applicable Laws.

  

  

  

Section 1.6 Officers. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Surviving Company until their successors are duly elected or appointed and

ARTICLE II

  

  

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Share Capital. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

  

  

(a) Conversion of Common Shares. Except as otherwise provided in Section
2.1(b), each common share of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (each, a
"Company Common Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $11.00 in cash, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"). Each Company Common Share to be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
share certificates representing Company Common Shares (the "Certificates") or
book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Company Common Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Common Shares other than, (i) in the case
of the Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded
Shares), the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger Consideration and (ii)
in the case of the Dissenting Shares, the right to receive the Appraised Fair
Value to the extent that the Appraised Fair Value is greater than the Merger
Consideration in accordance with (and subject to the terms of) Section 2.1(e).

  

  

  

(b) Treasury Shares; Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Company Common Share, held by
the Company as treasury stock or owned by any of the Company's wholly owned
Subsidiaries or owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the "Excluded Shares") shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in respect of the Excluded
Shares.

  

  

  

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Share Capital. Each common share, par value $1.00
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable common share, par value $1.00 per share, of the
Surviving Company.

  

  

  

(d) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding Company Common Shares
shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, share split
(including a reverse share split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any share dividend or share distribution (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Shares) with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change and such adjustment shall provide the
Company's shareholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action.

  

  

  

(e) Dissenters' Rights. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be
canceled and, unless otherwise required by any applicable Law or Order,
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in
Section 2.1(a), and any holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that
the fair value of a Dissenting Share as appraised by

  

  

  

3

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

the Supreme Court of Bermuda, under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act (the
"Appraised Fair Value") is greater than the Merger Consideration, be entitled
to receive such difference from the Company by payment made within thirty (30)
days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such
appraisal procedure. In the event that a holder fails to perfect, effectively
withdraws or otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an "Appraisal
Withdrawal"), such holder's Company Common Shares shall be canceled and
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for each such Company Common Share. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal or payment of
the fair value of any Company Common Shares, Appraisal Withdrawals and any
other instruments served pursuant to the Companies Act and received by the
Company relating to shareholders' rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the Companies Act and the Company shall not voluntarily,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
settle or offer to settle, any such demands. In no event shall the exercise by
one or more Dissenting Holders of demands for appraisal pursuant to the
Companies Act give rise to a right to terminate this Agreement.

  

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

  

(a) Exchange Fund. At least one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or
trust company that shall be appointed by Parent (and reasonably satisfactory
to the Company) to act as a paying agent hereunder (the "Paying Agent"), in
trust for the benefit of holders of Company Common Shares, cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for
all of the Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such cash in the
aggregate being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). In the event
the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
this Agreement, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an
amount sufficient to make such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by
Parent; provided, however, that (i) any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and (ii) no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to the former holders of Company Common Shares pursuant to
this Article II.

  

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures.

  

  

  

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third (3rd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Company
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by
hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common
Shares (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper

  

  

  

4

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss together with any required
bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration into which the number of Company Common Shares previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Parent shall require the paying agent agreement to
provide that the Paying Agent deliver such letter of transmittal and
instructions not later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time.
Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together with
any required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, including
by the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of any
Company Common Shares held in book entry on a book-entry statement, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily and reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together with any required bond
or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the number of Company Common Shares represented by such
holder's properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (B) the Merger Consideration (less any
applicable withholding Taxes). No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss together with any required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment upon
due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Shares is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable share transfer and other
applicable Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger
Consideration, paid in full (less any applicable withholding Taxes) with
respect to any Company Common Share in accordance with the terms hereof, shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Share.

  

  

  

(ii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (A)
shall be remitted by the applicable entity to the appropriate Governmental
Entity and (B) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith in requesting and
providing any information or documentation allowing for the reduction or
elimination of any such deduction and withholding.

  

  

  

(c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of the Company
Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates

  

  

  

5

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Company or Parent for
transfer, the holder of any such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and
instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of transmittal in
order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Article II.

  

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
former holders of Company Common Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Company upon its demand, and
any former holders of Company Common Shares who have not surrendered their
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance
with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of
their Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in each
case subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

  

(e) No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, and any such amounts will be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of such Company Common Shares.

  

  

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the case of any Certificate
that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number of Company Common
Shares formerly represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration (without interest and less any
applicable withholding Taxes).

  

  

  

Section 2.3 Treatment of Company Options and LTIP Awards; ESPP.

  

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, in connection with the Merger, automatically be
assumed by Public Parent, together with the Company Stock Plans, and be
converted into an option to purchase shares of Public Parent Common Stock
(each, a "Converted Option"). Each Converted Option so assumed by Public
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Converted Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any vesting provisions),
provided that (A) such Converted Option shall be exercisable for that number
of whole shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Public Parent
(the "Public Parent Common Stock") equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Shares
that were issuable upon exercise of such Converted Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Merger
Consideration and the denominator of which is the closing price of Public
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time (the "Award Exchange Ratio"), and (B) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Public Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Converted Option shall equal the quotient (rounded up to
the

  

  

  

6

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

nearest whole cent) of (i) the exercise price per Company Common Share
applicable to such Converted Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (ii) the Award Exchange Ratio. The exercise price and the number of shares
of Public Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Converted Options
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder;
provided, that in the case of any Converted Option to which Section 422 of the
Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Public Parent
Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in
accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in
order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. For purposes
of determining the exercise price of any Company Option that is not
denominated in U.S. Dollars (and rounded up to the nearest whole cent), such
exercise price shall be converted into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rate as
in effect on the business date immediately preceding the Effective Time (and
rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

  

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company LTIP Award outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be converted into that number of time-
vesting restricted share units of Public Parent Common Stock (each a
"Converted LTIP Award") equal to the product of (i) such Company LTIP Award's
Company Common Share Number and (ii) the Award Exchange Ratio. Any Converted
LTIP Awards issued pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions (including, without limitation, time-based vesting schedule) as
applied to the related Company LTIP Award, provided that any performance
vesting condition shall be waived. Accordingly, Converted LTIP Awards shall
vest based solely on continued employment or service. The "Company Common
Share Number" with respect to a Company LTIP Award shall be (w) with respect
to Company LTIP Awards that are vested as of the Effective Time, the actual
number of Company Common Shares earned in respect of performance, (x) with
respect to Company LTIP Awards for which the performance period has ended on
or prior to December 30, 2014 but which are not vested as of the Effective
Time, the actual number of Company Common Shares earned in respect of
performance, (y) with respect to Company LTIP Awards for which the performance
period ended after December 30, 2014 but prior to the Effective Time, the
number of Company Common Shares that will be earned based on the target level
of performance, and (z) with respect to Company LTIP Awards for which the
performance period has not ended as of the Effective Time, the number of
Company Common Shares that would be earned based on the target level of
performance. The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors shall take
any action reserved for it under the Company Stock Plans to further the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3(b).

  

  

  

(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that any
award of Company Options or Company LTIP Awards which are exercised or become
issuable due to expiration of the service vesting periods after the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date are fulfilled from those shares of the
Company held within the Kofax Employee Share Trust. Furthermore, in the event
there are no remaining shares of the Company in the Kofax Employee Share
Trust, the Company and/or the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors
shall initiate the necessary actions to terminate the Kofax Employee Share
Trust.

  

  

  

(d) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that (i) no
offering period under the ESPP shall be commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement and (ii) no new participants may join the offering period in effect
under the ESPP as of the date of this Agreement. In the event that the
offering period under the ESPP in effect as of the date of this Agreement has
not ended on the date immediately preceding the Effective Time, then the ESPP
and such offering period shall be terminated as of the day immediately
preceding the Effective

  

  

  

7

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

Time, and all participant contributions then in the ESPP shall be used to
purchase Company Common Shares on such date in accordance with the terms of
the ESPP as if such date was the last day of such offering period. As of the
Effective Time, all Company Common Shares purchased under the ESPP shall be
treated identically to all other Company Common Shares with respect to the
payment of the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 2.1(a), and the
Company shall cause the ESPP to terminate.

administrators or the SEC, as applicable, on a timely basis since December 6,
2013 (together with any documents so filed or furnished during such period on

the "Company SEC Documents"). Each of the Company SEC Documents complied as to

Securities Laws, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the
date filed or furnished with the UK securities administrators or the SEC, none
of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

  

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at such date, and the

and were prepared in conformity with IFRS applied on a consistent basis during
the periods referred to therein (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto).

  

  

  

(c) The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the six months
ended December 31, 2014, fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as at such date, and the consolidated results of operations and
consolidated cash flows for such period and were prepared in conformity with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods referred to therein
(except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments.

  

  

  

Section 3.6 Internal Controls and Procedures. The Company has designed and
maintained disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others in the
Company or its Subsidiaries to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Section 3.7 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a) as disclosed, reflected or
reserved against in the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2014 (or the notes thereto), (b) for
liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, (c) for
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
the date of such balance sheet, and (d) for liabilities or obligations that
have been discharged or paid in full, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or
not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, other than those which would not reasonably be
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

  

Section 3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since June 30, 2014 through
the date hereof, (i) the Company has conducted its business in all material
respects in the ordinary course, except in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated herein, and (ii) there has not occurred any
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

  

Section 3.9 Compliance with Law; Permits.

  

  

  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and since July 1, 2013 have been, in
all material respects, in compliance with all Laws affecting the Company's
business and no Governmental Entity has issued any written notice or
notification stating that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in
compliance with any Law.

  

  

  

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, registrations, approvals and orders of any
Governmental Entity (the "Company Permits") necessary for the Company and its
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets and to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted, except where the
failure to have any of the Company Permits would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. All Company Permits are in full force and effect, no default (with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both) has occurred under any such Company
Permit, and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice from any Governmental Entity threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw
or modify any such Company Permit, in each case, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

  

Section 3.10 Environmental Matters.

  

  

  

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws,

prior to the Closing, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal from any
Person, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify

making, and details of the material terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, and the Company and its Representatives may contact such
Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (i) the Company and its
Representatives may provide information (including any non-public information)
regarding, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books,

Sub, and (ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with such
Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent

constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a
substantially current basis, of the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, including any material amendments or proposed amendments
as to price and other material terms thereof.

  

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(c), the Company Board shall not

resolve to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Company Circular, (iii) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company,
an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares
of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is
commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by the Company shareholders (including, for these purposes, by
disclosing that it is taking no position with respect to the acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders, which shall

  

  

  

27

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer) within ten (10) Business Days after commencement, (any of the
foregoing, a "Change of Recommendation"), or authorize, adopt, approve or
propose to authorize, adopt, approve, an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or
permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may (A) effect a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that, as a result of a development or change in circumstances (not including
any developments or changes in circumstances arising out of the entry into of
any new, or modification, amendment or extension to or of any existing,
customer agreement of the Company or a Subsidiary) that occurs or arises after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than a Superior Proposal)
that was not known to the Company Board or any of the individuals listed on
Section 8.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (an "Intervening Event") failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (B) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.3(b) and enter into, the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement associated with such Superior Proposal; provided,
however, that the Company Board may only take the actions described in the
foregoing clause (B) if:

  

  

  

(1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent of the
Company Board's intention to take such actions at least three (3) Business
Days in advance of taking such action (or two (2) Business Days in the case of
any modifications or proposed modifications as to price and other material
terms of a Superior Proposal that is the subject of a prior notification under
this clause), which notice shall specify, as applicable, the material terms of
the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company that could reasonably result
in a Superior Proposal, including a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with, and the identity of, the party making the Acquisition
Proposal and other material documents (including any financing commitments
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal);

  

  

  

(2) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such
three (3) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period, as the case may be, to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the Acquisition Proposal would no longer meet the definition of a Superior
Proposal;

  

  

  

(3) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent by
5:00 PM Eastern Time on the last Business Day of such three (3) Business Day
or two (2) Business Day period, as the case may be, and shall have determined
in good faith (x) with respect to the actions described in clause (A) of this
Section 5.4(c), after consultation with outside counsel, that it would
continue to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law not to effect the Change of Recommendation and (y) with respect
to the actions described in clause (B) of this Section 5.4(c), after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that the
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were given effect; and

  

  

  

(4) the Company pays the Company Termination Fee in accordance with procedures
set forth in Section 7.6.

  

  

  

28

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company, the Company Board or any other committee of the Company Board from
(i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the shareholders of
the Company) provided that such communication only contains the information
set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of
any such tender offer. Actions permitted under this Section 5.4(d) shall not
be a basis for Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.3(a).

  

  

  

(e) As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer made by any Person for (i) a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) the direct or
indirect acquisition by any Person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or (iii)
the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the voting power of the outstanding Company Common Shares, including
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person beneficially owning Company Common Shares with fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the voting power of the outstanding Company Common Shares.

  

  

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term
changed from 15% to 50%) that the Company Board has determined in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) would, if consummated, be more favorable to the Company's
shareholders from a financial perspective than the Merger, taking into account
among other things all of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal (including the financing, likelihood and timing of consummation of
the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal) and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent
to the Company in writing in response to such Acquisition Proposal under the
provisions of Section 5.4(c)).

and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor
all Company Benefit Plans, and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective

amendment or termination of any of the foregoing in accordance with its terms.

Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Employees") (i) base compensation and
bonus opportunities that, in the aggregate, are at least equal to those that
were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time
(provided that Parent shall make no modifications to bonus opportunities with
respect to the Company's fiscal year ended June 30, 2015) and (ii) accrual
based-vacation policies that are

  

  

  

29

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

at least equal to those that were provided to the Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time. From the Effective time until December 31, 2015,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current Company
Employee, all other employee health, retirement and welfare benefits and
commission opportunities that are no less favorable than the compensation and
benefits or commissions that were provided to the Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company
or its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Company Employee whose employment
terminates during the period between the Effective Time and the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time, severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided for under the Company's
severance arrangements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

  

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate, severance, paid time off and level of benefits) under the
employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates providing benefits to any
Company Employee after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors, provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated (such plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability and/or life benefits to any Company
Employee (or his or her covered dependents) (collectively, the "Parent Welfare
Plans"), Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
limitations and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Welfare Plan to
be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, and, to
the extent permissible under Parent Welfare Plans, Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents under the corresponding Old Plan during the portion of the plan
year of such Old Plans ending on the date such Company Employee's
participation in the corresponding Parent Welfare Plan begins (such initial
plan year of participation, the "Initial Year of Participation") to be taken
into account under such Parent Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the Initial Year
of Participation as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
Parent Welfare Plan. Between the Effective Time and January 1, 2016, Parent
shall continue to maintain all Old Plans with respect to Company Employees.

  

  

  

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control," "change in control"
or similar phrase within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans, will occur
at or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

  

  

  

(d) Parent and the Company agree that prior to the Closing the Parent shall
engage in discussion with Company Employees with respect to adoption of a
retention program for employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to such
discussions, and grant Parent reasonable access to Company Employees for such
discussions.

  

  

  

(e) It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that nothing in this
Section 5.5 or otherwise contained in this Agreement is intended to or does or
shall constitute

  

  

  

30

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

an amendment to or establishment of any employee benefit or other plan or,
subject to the express provisions of Sections 5.5(a)-(d), shall prevent the
amendment or termination of any such plan. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
be a guarantee to any Company Employee of (i) employment or (ii) without
limiting the express provisions of Sections 5.5(a)-(d), any specific term or
condition of employment.

  

  

  

Section 5.6 Consents and Approvals.

  

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals,
and expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Company
Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, including, without
limitation, in connection with any Regulatory Law (all of the foregoing,
collectively, the "Governmental Consents"), (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the Transactions; provided that in no event
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the
Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for
any consent or approval required for the consummation of the Transactions
under any contract or agreement.

  

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in (i)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or Governmental
Consents are required to be obtained from, any Governmental Entities
(including in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries are operating any business) and (ii) to the extent not made prior
to the date hereof, timely making or causing to be made all such applications
and filings as reasonably determined by Parent and the Company as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof with respect to filings or submissions required under the HSR Act).
Each party shall supply as promptly as practicable such information,
documentation, other material or testimony that may be requested by any
Governmental Entity, including by complying at the earliest reasonably
practicable date with any request under or with respect to the HSR Act, any
other Governmental Consent and any such other applicable Laws for additional
information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
such applications or filings or the Merger.

  

  

  

(c) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such further action as may be necessary
to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice,
state antitrust enforcement authorities, or competition authorities of any
other nation or other jurisdiction (including multinational or supranational),
or any other Person, may assert under any Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated

  

  

  

31

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

herein, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Person with respect to the Merger, in each case so as
to enable the Merger and the Transactions to occur as soon as possible (and in
any event no later than the Termination Date), including by proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by agreement, consent decree, hold
separate order, trust or otherwise, (x) the sale, divestiture or disposition
of such assets, businesses, services, products or product lines of Parent or
the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) or
behavioral limitations, conduct restrictions or commitments with respect to
any such assets, businesses, services, products or product lines of Parent or
the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates), (y) the
creation or termination of relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates and (z) any other actions that would limit the freedom of action of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries'
(including the Company's or the Surviving Company's) or Affiliates' assets,
businesses, services, products or product lines, in each case as may be
required in order to obtain all required Governmental Consents as promptly as
practicable (including expirations or terminations of waiting periods whether
imposed by Law or agreement) and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or delaying any of the foregoing beyond the Termination Date (each
of (x), (y) and (z), a "Divestiture Action"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) nothing in this Section 5.06(c) shall require, or be construed to require,
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates to take a Divestiture Action in
the event it would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse
effect to the Parent Business or a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
the Company shall not take any Divestiture Action without first obtaining the
consent of Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
without Parent's prior written consent, and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without the Company's prior written consent, discuss or
commit to any extension of any waiting period under any Law or any agreement
not to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be required to
take any action pursuant to this Section 5.6 unless it is expressly
conditioned on the effectiveness of the Merger.

  

  

  

(d) Without limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal limitations
and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, each of the Company and
Parent agrees (i) to cooperate and consult with each other in connection with
the making of all registrations, filings, notifications, communications,
submissions and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 5.6, (ii)
to furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any notifications
or filings, (iii) to keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated therein, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, (iv) to permit the
other party to review and to incorporate the other party's reasonable comments
in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Entity with respect
to obtaining the necessary approvals for the Transactions, and (v) not to
participate in any meeting or discussion in person or by telephone expected to
address substantive matters related to the transactions contemplated herein
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions unless, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, it gives the other
party reasonable notice thereof and the opportunity to attend and observe. The
parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product

  

  

  

32

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
Section 5.6 in a manner so as to preserve any applicable privilege. Parent and
the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
5.6(d) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

  

  

  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a Governmental Entity or any other
Person is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of any Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use
best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions,
including, without limiting the foregoing, taking the actions set forth in
Section 5.6(c).

  

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the EC Merger
Regulation, and all other federal, state, foreign, multinational or
supranational statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other Laws, including, without limitation, any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Laws, that are designed or intended
to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition and including any Laws that relate to foreign investments.

  

  

  

Section 5.7 Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Transactions after the date of this Agreement, Parent, the
board of directors of Parent, the Company and the Company Board shall each use
its respective reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize, to the extent possible,
the effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

  

  

  

Section 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by
such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or
the Merger, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Company or Parent and (b) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party which relate to the Transactions or this Agreement.

  

  

  

Section 5.9 Public Announcements. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation
except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations imposed by any
national securities exchange or as may be requested

  

  

  

33

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

by a Governmental Entity; provided that the restrictions in this Section 5.9
shall not apply to any Company communication regarding an Acquisition Proposal
or a Change of Recommendation. Parent and the Company agree to issue a joint
press release announcing this Agreement. Either party may, without
consultation, issue any press release or other public statement in connection
with a dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein, if required by Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as
may be requested by a Governmental Entity.

  

  

  

Section 5.10 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

  

(a) The Surviving Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor
of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or bye-laws or other organizational documents or in any
agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to (i) maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Company's and any Company
Subsidiary's certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors or officers as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (ii) to not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former
directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify
and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the Indemnified
Parties) each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and each Person who served at the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' request or direction, or for their benefit, as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(each, together with such Person's heirs, executors or administrators, an
"Indemnified Party") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Losses") in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an
"Action"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before, at or after the
Effective Time in connection with such Indemnified Party's service as a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or acts or
omissions in connection with such Indemnified Party's service as officer,
director, member, trustee or other fiduciary in any other entity if such
services were at the request, at the direction or for the benefit of the
Company), including an Action arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time; provided, that any
Person to whom any funds are advanced pursuant to the foregoing must, if
required by Law, provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined the indemnification of such Person is not permitted
under Law. In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

  

  

  

34

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time, or (ii) Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to purchase, for effectiveness on the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
herein; provided that in the case of either (i) or (ii) above, in no event
shall the Surviving Company be required to expend more than a cumulative
amount for such insurance or a tail policy in excess of 300% of the aggregate
annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to
maintain the existing policies to maintain or procure insurance coverage
pursuant hereto, in which case the Surviving Company shall provide the
greatest coverage that is then available for 300% of such annual premium. If
such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, in accordance with clause (i) above, Parent shall cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause
all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Company.

  

  

  

(d) Parent shall or shall cause to be paid all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity, advancement and other obligations provided in this
Section 5.10.

  

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company,
any other indemnification arrangement, the Companies Act or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations
under this Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such
Indemnified Party.

  

  

  

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 5.10.

  

  

  

Section 5.11 Merger Sub. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause
Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (b) cause
the Surviving Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement and (c)
ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any
business or make any investments other than as specifically contemplated by
this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any Indebtedness.

  

  

  

Section 5.12 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

  

  

  

35

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

Section 5.13 Obligations of Public Parent. Public Parent hereby (i)
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the prompt and full discharge by
each of Parent and Merger Sub of all of their respective covenants,
agreements, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement including the due
and punctual payment of all amounts which are or may become due and payable by
Parent or Merger Sub hereunder when and as the same shall become due and
payable and (ii) acknowledges and agrees to take all actions necessary to
satisfy its obligations with respect to Converted Options and Converted Awards
pursuant to Sections 2.3(a) and (b) hereof (collectively, the "Obligations"),
in accordance with the terms hereof. Public Parent acknowledges and agrees
that, with respect to all Obligations to pay money, such guaranty shall be a
guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and shall not be
conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against Parent or
Merger Sub. If Parent or Merger Sub shall default in the due and punctual
performance of any Obligations, including the full and timely payment of any
amount due and payable pursuant to any Obligations, Public Parent will
forthwith perform or cause to be performed such Obligations and will forthwith
make full payment of any amount due with respect thereto at its sole cost and
expense. The liabilities and obligations of Public Parent pursuant to this
Agreement are unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by
(x) any modification, amendment or supplement to this Agreement or (y) any
change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Merger
Sub. Public Parent hereby waives any right, whether legal or equitable,
statutory or non-statutory, to require any person to proceed against or take
any action against or pursue any remedy with respect to Parent or Merger Sub
or any other person or make presentment or demand for performance or give any
notice of nonperformance before the Company may enforce its rights hereunder
against Public Parent.

material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this
Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.

such date;

  

  

  

(b) if this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement have been submitted

and Material Breach of its obligations under Section 5.2 or Section 5.4; or

  

  

  

(b) if the Company breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and

Section 7.5 Manner and Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this Article VII, it shall become void and of no further force and
effect, with no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement (or any
shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent or Representative of such

termination shall relieve any party of liability for (a) the Willful and
Material Breach by any party to perform its obligations, (b) the Willful and
Material Breach by any party of its representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement or (c) fraud. The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
this Section 7.5, and the provisions of Section 5.3(b) (Access;

Payment) and Article VIII (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of

Section 7.6 Termination Payment. Any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding,

  

  

  

(a) The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (and if such amount
is actually paid pursuant to this Agreement, it shall constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective Affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers or agents for
any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated) by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal
to the Company Termination Fee:

  

  

  

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4(a),
in which case payment shall be made within one (1) Business Day of such
termination;

  

  

  

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or
Section 7.3(b), in which case payment shall be made within one (1) Business
Day of such termination; or

  

  

  

(iii) if (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made or proposed to the
Company or otherwise publicly announced, (B) this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), and
(C) within

  

  

  

39

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

twelve (12) months following the date of such termination, the Company enters
into a Contract for or relating to, or otherwise consummates any Acquisition
Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (A)), in which case payment shall be made
within three (3) Business Days of the date on which the Company consummates
such Acquisition Proposal. Following receipt by Parent of the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 7.6, the Company shall have no
further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein to Parent or Merger Sub.

  

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 8.5 with respect to the enforcement of the provisions of
this Section 7.6, Parent's right to receive payment from the Company of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company
Specified Person") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Specified Persons shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

  

Section 8.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement and
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto by any party hereto shall terminate
at the Effective Time or, except as provided in Section 7.5, upon the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1 to 7.4, as the case may
be, except that this Section 8.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of
the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time or after termination of this Agreement, including those contained in
Section 5.5 and Section 5.10.

  

  

  

Section 8.2 Expenses. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring such Expense.

  

  

  

Section 8.3 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more consecutive counterparts (including by facsimile or PDF transmission),
each of which shall be deemed to be an original, with the same effect as if
the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument, and shall
become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered (electronically or otherwise) to the other parties.

  

  

  

Section 8.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of law. The parties to this Agreement irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States of America located in
the State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(each, a "Chosen Court") solely in

  

  

  

40

  

  

  


 

  

  

  

respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement (other than the
Statutory Merger Agreement, which shall be interpreted, construed, governed
and enforced as set forth therein), and in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as
a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document (other than the Statutory Merger
Agreement, which shall be interpreted, construed, governed and enforced as set
forth therein), that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document (other than the Statutory Merger Agreement, which shall be
interpreted, construed, governed and enforced as set forth therein) may not
(as a result of a lack of personal jurisdiction) be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such a Delaware
state or federal court. The parties to this Agreement agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 8.7 or in such other manner as may be permitted
by applicable Laws, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, the choice of
governing law construction of this Agreement and the submission of disputes to
the Chosen Court shall not be deemed to cause the fiduciary duties of any
jurisdiction other than Bermuda to apply to the obligations of the Company
Board with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

  

Section 8.5 Remedies; Specific Enforcement.

  

  

  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Each party agrees that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages) to (i) a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach.

  

  

  

(b) Each party further agrees that (i) it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity and (ii) no other party or any other Person shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  

  

  

Section 8.6 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN. EACH
PARTY (A) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

Section 8.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this Section 8.8 shall be null and void.

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

  

Section 8.10 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the exhibits and schedules hereto (including the Company Disclosure Letter)
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. Except as provided below and Section 5.5 (which shall be
for the benefit of the Company Employees) and Section 5.10 (which shall be for
the benefit of the Indemnified Parties), this Agreement is not intended to and
shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except (i) the
right of the Company on behalf of its shareholders to pursue damages
(including claims for damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the
transaction to the Company's shareholders) or other relief in the event of
Parent's or Merger Sub's Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement and
(ii) for in the event the Effective Time shall have occurred, the rights of
the Company's shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration and holders of
the Company Options and Company LTIP Awards to receive the substitutions of
awards pursuant to Section 2.3, at the Effective Time and the other actions
(including payments) contemplated by Section 2.3, which rights are hereby
expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub. The third-party
beneficiary rights referenced in clause (i) above may be exercised only by the
Company (on behalf of its shareholders and holders of Company Options and
Company LTIP Awards as their agent) through actions expressly approved by the
Company Board at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company Board, and no
shareholders of the Company or holders of Company Options or Company LTIP
Awards whether purporting to act in its capacity as a shareholder,
optionholder or Company LTIP Award holder or purporting to assert any right
(derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the Company, shall have any right or
ability to exercise or cause the exercise of any such right, it being
understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims will attach to
such Company Common Shares and subsequently trade and transfer therewith. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.11
without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.11 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
to this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or
after obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, so long as (a) no amendment that
requires further shareholder approval under applicable Laws after the
Requisite Company Vote shall be made without such required further shareholder
approval and (b) such amendment has been duly approved by the board of
directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the
parties to this Agreement. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under
this Agreement, or (c) subject to applicable Laws, waive compliance with any
of the covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights. In order to be effective, (a) any
termination or amendment of this Agreement shall require the prior approval of
that action by the board of directors of each party seeking to terminate or
amend this Agreement and (b) any extension or waiver of any obligation under
this Agreement or condition to the consummation of this Agreement shall
require the prior approval of a duly authorized officer or the board of
directors of the party or parties entitled to extend or waive that obligation
or condition.
