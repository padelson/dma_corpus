_Section_ __ _ 3.2_ (either directly or as an offset to a downward Purchase
Price adjustment) to the extent attributable to Property Costs or other

(ii) if applicable, the amount by which the Effective Time Net Working
Capital for Oakfield is less than Zero Dollars ($0.00);

(iii) the amount of all Property Costs (including rentals, utilities,

to the extent that such deposits will not be returned to Buyer after the
Closing) with respect to the Conveyed Properties and attributable to periods
prior to the Effective Time and that are subsequently paid by or on behalf of
Buyer or its affiliate (including Oakfield, unless such costs or expense are
included in the Effective Time Net Working Capital for Oakfield);

 



25 (iv) an amount equal to all Production Taxes (not deducted or netted
from the proceeds described in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(ii)_) allocated to
Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ that are unpaid as of the
Closing and that are subsequently paid or otherwise economically borne by
Buyer or its affiliate (including Oakfield), which amount shall, where
possible, be computed based upon the Production Tax rate and values applicable
to the taxable period in question (or if unavailable, the Production Tax rate
and values applicable to the immediately preceding taxable period);

 

(v) an amount equal to the sum of the Allocated Value of each
Retained Property with respect to which a reduction of the Purchase Price is
permitted pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VI_;

 

(vi) an amount equal to the aggregate of all Title Defect

(vii) an amount equal to the product of the amount (measured in MMBtus)

Oil and Gas Interests being overproduced or from Seller having underdelivered
prior to the Effective Time _times_ $4.00 per Mcf;

by Buyer in connection with the termination and liquidation of any Subject
Hedging Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(e)_); and

 

(xi) any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or

(c) Determination of whether costs and/or expenses (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Taxes) are attributable to the period before or after
the Effective Time for purposes of the adjustments provided for in _Section_
__ _ 3.2_ is based on when services are rendered, when the goods are
delivered or when the work is performed. For clarification, the date an item
or work is ordered is not the date of a transaction for settlement purposes
hereunder, but rather the date on which the item ordered is delivered to the
job site, or the date on which the work ordered is performed, is the relevant
date. For purposes of allocating Hydrocarbon

 



26  production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), (i) liquid
Hydrocarbons are deemed to be "attributable to" the Subject Oil and Gas
Interests when they pass through the wellhead into the storage facilities
into which they are run and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons are deemed to be
"attributable to" Subject Oil and Gas Interests when they pass through the
delivery point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are
transported. Seller may utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive
at an allocation of Hydrocarbon production when exact meter readings or
gauging and strapping data is not available.

 

Section 3.3 _Allocated Values_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer agree and stipulate that the Allocated Values set
forth on _Exhibit C_ have been established for use where appropriate,
including for Seller to provide any required preferential purchase right
notifications and in calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided
herein. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price (other than those made pursuant
to _Sections 3.2(a)(iv)_ , _3.2(b)(v)_ and _3.2(b)(vi)_ , which shall be
applied to the Listed Interests with respect to which such adjustments relate)
shall be applied on a pro-rata basis to the amounts set forth on _Exhibit C_.

 

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree
to an allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted, and any other items
properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes among
the Conveyed Properties (including the Oakfield Assets) in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
") and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the United States Department
of the Treasury (the " _Treasury Regulations_ ") and, to the extent
allowed by applicable Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values,
within thirty (30) days after the date that the Final Settlement Statement is
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ (the " _Allocation_ ").
If Seller and Buyer reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation, (i)
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the
Allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer
and Seller shall, and shall cause their affiliates to, report consistently
with the Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns, including
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section
1060), and neither Seller nor Buyer nor their respective affiliates shall take
positions inconsistent with such Allocation in any audit or other proceedings
with respect to any Taxes; provided, however, that neither Party shall be
unreasonably impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise
and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with
such allocation.

 

Section 3.4 _Spud Fee_. If the Closing occurs, then, in addition to
payment of the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement) as
provided herein, Seller shall be entitled to the Spud Fee (as defined in
_Exhibit K_ ) as and to the extent provided in, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, _Exhibit K_.

employment, Buyer shall send to Seller a schedule identifying each Available
Employee who received an offer of employment from Buyer or its affiliate or
designee, and whether such offer of employment was for compensation greater
than, less than or equal to the compensation currently being paid to such
Available Employee. All offers of employment contemplated by this  _Section_
__ _ 5.9(a)_ shall expire at least five (5) days prior to the Closing, and
after the Closing shall be void. Buyer shall promptly, but in any event at
least four (4) days prior to the Closing, notify Seller of whether such
offers of employment have been accepted or rejected by the applicable
Available Employees (and, if the agreed upon compensation differs from the

compensation arrangement (i.e., as greater than, less than, or equal to
current compensation)). Buyer hereby agrees that it will comply with all
applicable Laws in making any employment decisions and taking any actions
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_. Buyer also agrees that it will
provide copies of any offer letters and/or acceptance letters to Seller at its
reasonable request. All Available Employees who accept an offer of employment
from, and commence employment with, Buyer or its affiliate or designee shall
be referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_."

 

(b) Seller shall terminate the employment of each Available Employee
who accepts an offer of employment made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_
effective as of the Closing Date or, if later, as of the date on which such

occurs within ninety (90) days after the Closing or such later time as may be
required by Law). Seller shall be solely responsible for all (i) obligations
owed to, and Liabilities that are attributable to, associated with or related
to, or that arise out of or in connection with the employment of (A) those
Business Employees who do not become Transferred Employees, including Rejected
Available Employees, and (B) the Transferred Employees, if any, up to and
including the last date of their employment with Seller or its affiliate,
including, in each case, salary, bonus (including any "retention bonus" or
"stay bonus"), accrued paid time off, severance, retirement benefits and

any

 



44  offer of employment made by Buyer or its affiliate or designee pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_ (collectively, " _Rejected Available Employees_ ").

such Specified Hedging Agreement fails to authorize or enter into any such
amendment, waiver or transfer, Seller shall not be in breach of this _Section_
__ _ 5.10_ for such counterpartys failure to authorize or enter into such

(d) In the event that the Closing occurs and any Specified Hedging
Agreement is not able to be novated to Buyer at the Closing because the
applicable counterparty thereto does not consent to entering into the
applicable Novation Instruments and/or related ISDA agreement with Buyer (any

Agreement to Buyer within such ninety (90) day period, and (ii) Seller shall
remain a party to such Untransferred Hedging Agreement and maintain such
Untransferred Hedging Agreement in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms and  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_, provided Buyer shall INDEMNIFY,

any and all Liabilities incurred by Seller (or any of the other Seller

(e) In the event that (X) any Untransferred Hedging Agreement is not
able to be novated to Buyer within ninety (90) days after Closing in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.10(d)_ and _5.11_ , or (Y) this Agreement is

liquidation of such Subject Hedging Agreements, and (ii) upon agreement
amongst the applicable counterparty and Buyer as to the mutual termination and
liquidation of such Subject Hedging Agreements and an amount to be paid to or
by Seller upon liquidation of such Subject Hedging Agreements, Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Subject Hedging Agreements

46   _however_ , that Seller shall not take any affirmative action to liquidate
any Subject Hedging Agreements except to the extent Buyer consents in writing
to the liquidation amount to be received or payable by Seller or any of its
affiliates in connection with any such liquidation, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, or such Subject Hedging
Agreements by their term provides for a liquidation under such circumstances;
_provided further_ , and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Seller,
Buyer and the applicable counterparty are not able to jointly negotiate the
mutual termination and liquidation of any Subject Hedging Agreement within
thirty (30) days following the expiration of the ninety (90) day period
following Closing, Seller may proceed to terminate and liquidate such Subject
Hedging Agreement without the consent of Buyer except that Buyer shall have
the right to consent in writing to the liquidation amount to be received or
payable by Seller or any of its affiliates in connection with any such
liquidation, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. With respect to any such Subject Hedging Agreements that are

transactions contemplated thereby and the actions to be taken by the Parties
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ are

of (i) the representations and warranties made by either Party in this
Agreement or in any certificate to be delivered at Closing or (ii) the
covenants contained in  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_.

 

Section 5.11 _Novation_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause, as promptly as practical after the Execution Date, the
counterparties to the existing hedges described on _Schedule 5.10(a)_ (the "
_Existing Hedging Agreements_ ") to novate such counterparties positions
under the Existing Hedging Agreements to Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, and Buyer shall pay to Seller one-half (1/2) of the fees paid by
Seller to a counterparty that was necessary to effect any such novation. In
addition, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause at Closing
the novation of the Specified Hedging Agreements and the Existing Hedging
Agreements to Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver (or cause to
be executed and delivered) to the Specified Hedging Agreement and Existing

Instruments_ "). Buyer shall execute an ISDA agreement with each applicable
counterparty of the Specified Hedging Agreements prior to such novation and
pay to Seller any fees paid by Seller to a trade counterparty that was
necessary to effect any novation of a Specified Hedging Agreement. Seller
shall consult with Buyer regarding any such fee prior to agreeing to pay for
such fee. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an
ISDA agreement with each applicable counterparty of the Existing Hedging
Agreements and to cause at Closing the novation of the Existing Hedging
Agreements; _provided_ that Seller shall be responsible for any novation fees

ARTICLE VI

 

EXAMINATION OF TITLE AND PROPERTIES

 

Section 6.1 _Access_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date, until 5:00 p.m. Central time on
the thirtieth (30th) day after the Execution Date (the " _Defect Deadline_
"), Seller shall give Buyer (and any of its officers, employees, agents,
accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, landmen, consultants or other
designated representatives (collectively, " _Buyer_ __ _s Representatives_
")) reasonable access to Sellers personnel and the Conveyed Properties
(including the Records in Sellers or its affiliates possession), solely for
the purpose of Buyers due diligence investigation of the Conveyed Properties,
but only to the extent that Seller or its affiliates may do so without
violating any confidentiality or other obligations to any third party and
only to the extent that Seller or its affiliates have the authority to grant
such access without breaching any obligation or restriction binding on Seller
or any of its affiliates; _provided_ that Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver of any such obligation or restriction.
Such access by Buyer shall be limited to Sellers normal business hours, and
Buyers investigation shall be conducted in a manner that
minimizes interference with the operation of the Conveyed Properties and at
the sole cost and expense of Buyer.

 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that the permission of the operator (if other
than Seller or its affiliate) or another third Person may be required before
Buyer will be able to inspect portions of the Conveyed Properties and that
such permission must be obtained prior to the inspection of such portions.
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such permission
for Buyer upon Buyers request. All investigations and due diligence conducted
by Buyer or Buyers Representatives shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost,
risk and expense 

 



48  (except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Seller Indemnified Parties), and any conclusions made from any such
investigations and due diligence done by Buyer or any of Buyers
Representatives shall result from Buyers own independent review and judgment.
Buyer agrees to comply with (and to cause Buyers Representatives to comply
with) the rules, regulations and instructions issued by Seller or any
operator of the Conveyed Properties regarding the actions of Buyer (and
Buyers Representatives) in conducting any inspection pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_. Any physical inspections or other environmental review
or diligence (including Buyers Environmental Review) shall be performed by a
reputable engineering firm and/or environmental consultant reasonably
acceptable to Seller.

 

Section 6.2 _Environmental Property Inspection_.

 

(a) From and after the Execution Date, until the Defect Deadline,
Seller shall permit Buyer and Buyers Representatives, at Buyers sole risk,
cost and expense, reasonable access to the Conveyed Properties operated by
Seller (or any of its affiliates) to conduct field inspections for purposes of
Buyers due diligence investigation of environmental matters relating to the
Conveyed Properties (" _Buyer_ __ _s Environmental Review_ "). In connection
with the granting of such access, subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_, Buyer
agrees that Buyer shall be liable to Seller for any and all damage to the
Conveyed Properties arising out of or relating to Buyers (or Buyers
Representatives) inspection and access to the Conveyed Properties. Buyer
shall, and shall cause Buyers Representatives to, abide by Sellers (or any
of its affiliates) safety rules, regulations and operating policies of which
they are informed while conducting Buyers Environmental Review. The scope of
work comprising Buyers Environmental Review shall be limited to Phase 1
Activities unless based on the results of such Phase 1 Activities, an
independent third party consultant (including the consultant engaged by Buyer
to conduct Buyers Environmental Review) reasonably recommends that sampling
or testing of environmental media or operation of equipment is necessary to
confirm that an Environmental Defect exists or to calculate the Environmental
Defect Amount, and Buyer requests in writing to do so. If Buyer requests
authorization to perform any sampling, testing or operation, Seller shall have
the right, in its sole discretion, to reject Buyers request up to and
within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt. However, if Seller rejects Buyers
request, Buyer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to exclude the
applicable Conveyed Property from the Conveyed Properties conveyed by Seller
to Buyer at Closing in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Retained Property. Buyer shall (i) consult with Seller
before conducting any work comprising Buyers Environmental Review, (ii)
perform all such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not
unreasonably interfere with Sellers (or any of its affiliates) operations,
(iii) comply with all applicable Laws and customary industry practices, and
promptly and completely (x) remove all equipment, tools or other property
brought onto the Conveyed Properties in connection with Buyers Environmental
Review and (y) restore the Conveyed Properties and repair any damage thereto
resulting from Buyers Environmental Review. Seller shall have the right to
have one or more representatives accompany Buyer at all times during Buyers
Environmental Review, and Buyer shall give Seller at least forty-eight (48)
hours notice prior to any visits by it (or any Buyer Representatives) to the
Conveyed Properties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Buyer may not access, and may not conduct Buyers Environmental
Review with respect to, any Conveyed Property where Seller or its affiliates
do not have the authority to grant access for such due diligence and review;
_provided_ , _however_ , Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain permission from any necessary third 

 



49  party operator to allow Buyer and Buyers Representatives such access, it
being understood by Buyer that the execution by Buyer or Buyers
Representatives of a customary access agreement may be a condition of such
access. The Parties agree that all information discovered during Buyers
Environmental Review shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

(b) BUYER SHALL DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF,
RESULTING FROM, BASED ON, ASSOCIATED WITH, OR RELATING TO, IN ANY WAY, THE
ACCESS AFFORDED TO BUYER PURSUANT TO THIS _ARTICLE VI_ , REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE,
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY (i) LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT RESULTING FROM THE
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES AND (ii) LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS MERELY DISCOVERED AS
A RESULT OF BUYERS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW THAT WERE EXISTING PRIOR TO SUCH
ACCESS, WHICH LIABILITIES SHALL BE ALLOCATED PURSUANT TO THE OTHER PROVISIONS
OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL CONTINUE IN FULL FORCE AND
EFFECT NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 

(c) From and after the Execution Date until the Closing, Buyer will
maintain, at its sole cost and expense and with insurers reasonably
satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts
set forth on _Schedule 6.2(c)_. Coverage under all insurance required to be
carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary insurance, (ii) list Seller
Indemnified Parties as additional insureds, (iii) waive subrogation against
Seller Indemnified Persons, and (iv) provide for thirty (30) days prior
notice to Seller of cancellation or modification of the policy or reduction
in coverage. Buyer will provide evidence of such insurance to Seller prior to
entering upon the Conveyed Properties.

 

Section 6.3 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyers (a) rights with
respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1(j)_ ,
_4.1(p)_ , _4.1(q)_ , _4.1(r)_ , _4.1(s)_ , _4.1(t)_ and _4.1(v)_ , (b) rights
under the special warranty of title under the Assignment and the Surface
Deed, (c) rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
13.1(c)_, and (d) rights under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(e)_ (to the extent
relating to clause (b), clause (d), clause (e), clause (f) and clause (h) of
the Retained Liabilities definition), the rights and remedies of Buyer set
forth in this _Article VI_ shall be Buyers exclusive rights and remedies with
respect to any defect of title (including any Title Defect but excluding
title to the Oakfield Interests), any Environmental Defect and any
Environmental Liability with respect to the Conveyed Properties, and the
provisions of _Article_ __ _ XI_ (other than Buyers (i) rights provided in
_Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ for a breach of Sellers representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1(j)_ , _4.1(p)_ , _4.1(q)_ , _4.1(r)_ ,
_4.1(s)_ ,  _4.1(t)_ and _4.1(v)_ , and (ii) rights under _Section_ __ _
11.2(e)_ (to the extent relating to clause (b), clause (d), clause (e), clause
(f) and clause (h) of the Retained Liabilities definition)) shall not apply
with respect to any defect in title (including any Title Defect but excluding
title to the Oakfield Interests), Environmental Defect or Environmental
Liability; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything the contrary
herein, any such remedies (and any recoveries of damages or monies pursuant

 



50  thereto or otherwise) shall be without duplication of Title Defect Amounts
and/or Environmental Defect Amounts for which Buyer receives a Purchase Price
Adjustment or other remedy pursuant to this _Article VI_.

Section 6.4 _Notice of Title Defects_ _ and Title Benefits;
Remedies_.

(a) If Seller discovers any Title Benefit, or Buyer discovers any
Title Defect, then such Party may deliver to the other Party, on or prior to
the Defect Deadline, a Title Notice with respect to such Title Benefit or
Title Defect, as applicable. Except as set forth in the special warranty of
title contained in the Assignment and the Surface Deed, Seller and Buyer shall
be deemed to have waived, and neither Buyer nor Seller, respectively, shall
have any liability for, any Title Benefit or Title Defect for which Buyer
or Seller, respectively, has not received a proper Title Notice on or before
the Defect Deadline. For the avoidance of doubt, if Buyer or Seller fails to
provide a Title Notice which satisfies the requirements set forth in the
definition of Title Notice, then the relevant Title Defect(s) or Title
Benefit(s), as the case may be, shall be deemed waived.

 

(b) With respect to each Listed Interest for which Buyer has asserted a
Title Defect pursuant to a properly and timely delivered Title Notice (each
such Listed Interest, a " _Title Defect Property_ "), Seller shall have until
the third (3rd) day prior to Closing (the " _Defect Response Date_ ") to
notify Buyer of those asserted Title Defects Seller elects to attempt to cure
(each, a " _Title Cure Election_ ") and those asserted Title Defects and/or
the Title Defect Amounts Seller disputes (each, a " _Title Dispute Election_
"). At Closing or upon resolution of a Disputed Title Matter, as applicable,
with respect to each Title Defect Property that Seller has not cured (and
Buyer has not elected to waive in writing), the following shall apply:

(i) if the Title Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the
Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property, then Seller shall
have the option, in its sole discretion, to exclude such Title Defect Property
(and all related or associated Conveyed Properties) from the
Conveyed Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
in which case, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
such Retained Property ( _provided_ , _however_ , any Conveyed Properties
owned by Oakfield may not be excluded from the transactions contemplated
hereby and clause (ii) below shall apply thereto); or

 

(ii) Seller shall include such Title Defect Property (and all related
or associated Conveyed Properties) (any such Title Defect Property, together
with all other such Title Defect Properties, the " _Included Title Defect
Properties_ ") in the Conveyed Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement, in which case, (A) if Seller has not made a Title Cure
Election or Title Dispute Election with respect to such Title Defect Property
prior to the Defect Response Date, the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall
be reduced by the Title Defect Amount for such Included Title Defect Property
(as determined by mutual agreement of the Parties), (B) if Seller has made a
Title Cure Election or Title Dispute Election with respect to such Title
Defect Property prior to the Defect Response Date, the Purchase Price payable
at Closing shall be reduced by the Title Defect Amount for such Included Title
Defect Property (as determined by mutual agreement of the Parties or if the
Parties cannot agree, by Buyer acting reasonably and in good faith) and at
the Closing Buyer shall deposit such amount into the Escrow Account pending
the curing or resolution of the applicable Title Defect, or (C)

 



51  upon resolution of a Disputed Title Matter, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced (without duplication) by the Title Defect Amount (if any) for such
Included Title Defect Property (as determined by the Arbitrator).

(c) With respect to any Included Title Defect Property for which there
is a timely delivered Title Cure Election or Title Dispute Election, until the
one hundred twentieth (120th) day after the Closing (such period, the " _Cure
Period_ "), Seller may, but shall have no obligation to, at its sole cost and
expense, cure the Title Defect asserted with respect to such Included Title
Defect Property. If, as of the expiration of the Cure Period, Seller has cured
(or partially cured) any Title Defect affecting any Included Title
Defect Property, within ten (10) days after the end of the Cure Period,
Seller and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the amounts
deposited in escrow in respect of any portion of the Title Defect that was
cured to Seller, and pay the amounts deposited in escrow in respect of any
portion of the Title Defect that was not cured to Buyer. With respect to any
Included Title Defect Property for which there is a timely delivered Title
Dispute Election, the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall apply and at
the resolution of such Disputed Matter pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, the
amount deposited in escrow with respect thereto shall be released from the
Escrow Account to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, pursuant to the decision of
the Arbitrator.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no
event shall there be any remedies provided by Seller (other than with respect
to the special warranty of title provided in the Assignment and the Surface
Deed delivered at Closing), and Seller shall not be responsible for nor shall
the Purchase Price be reduced for, (i) any individual Title Defect for which
the Title Defect Amount does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (the
" _Title Threshold_ ") or (ii) any Title Defect with respect to which the
Title Defect Amount exceeds the applicable Title Threshold, unless and until
the aggregate of (1) all such Title Defect Amounts that exceed the applicable
Title Threshold (excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title
Defects that are cured by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_ and less
the aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts that exceed the Title Threshold)
and (2) all such Environmental Defect Amounts that exceed the applicable
Environmental Threshold (excluding the amount of Environmental Defect Amounts
attributable to Environmental Defects that are cured by Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_), exceeds an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the
aggregate of the Allocated Values of all Listed Interests (the " _Defect
Deductible_ "), and then only with respect to the amount of such Title Defect
Amounts (less such Title Benefit Amounts) that exceed the Defect Deductible.

 

Section 6.5 _Title Defect Amount; Title Benefit Amount_.

 

(a) The amount by which the Allocated Value of any Listed Interest is
reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect with respect thereto
is the " _Title Defect Amount_ ", which shall be determined in accordance with
the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then such
amount shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



52 (ii) if the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance that is undisputed
and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the
amount necessary to be paid to remove such encumbrance from the Listed
Interest;

 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in (A) the actual
Net Revenue Interest for any Well, with respect to the Target Depth for such
Well, below (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit C_ for such Well
(and there is a corresponding decrease in the Working Interest for such Well
below the Working Interest stated on _Exhibit C_ with respect to the Target
Depth for such Listed Interest), then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of (y) the Allocated Value of such Well _multiplied_ _by_ (z) one
(1),  _minus_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue
Interest for such Well, with respect to the Target Depth for such Well, and
the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest for such Well stated on 
_Exhibit_ __ _ C_;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in (A) the actual Net
Revenue Interest for any Undeveloped Lease, with respect to the Target Depth
for such Undeveloped Lease, below (B) the Net Revenue Interest Floor (or the
Net Revenue Interest set forth on  _Exhibit_ __ _ C_ for such Undeveloped
Lease, as the case may be) (and there is a corresponding decrease in the
Working Interest for such Undeveloped Lease below the Working Interest stated
on _Exhibit C_ with respect to the Target Depth for such Listed Interest),
then the Title Defect Amount shall be an amount equal to the product of the
Allocated Value of such Undeveloped Lease _multiplied by_ a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount by which the Net Revenue Interest Floor (or
the Net Revenue Interest set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ C_ for such Undeveloped
Lease, as the case may be) exceeds such actual Net Revenue Interest, with
respect to the Target Depth for such Undeveloped Lease, and the denominator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest Floor (or the Net Revenue Interest set
forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ C_ for such Undeveloped Lease, as the case may be);

 

(v) if the Title Defect represents a decrease in (A) the actual
Net Mineral Acres covered by an Undeveloped Lease (with respect to the Target
Depth for such Undeveloped Lease) below (B) the Net Mineral Acres for such
Undeveloped Lease stated on _Exhibit C_ , then the Title Defect Amount shall
be the product of (x) the Allocated Value of such Undeveloped Lease
_multiplied by_ (y) one (1), _minus_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the
actual Net Mineral Acres covered by such Undeveloped Lease (with respect to
the Target Depth for such Undeveloped Lease) and the denominator of which is
the Net Mineral Acres for such Undeveloped Lease stated on _Exhibit C_ ;

 

(vi) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or encumbrance upon,
or other defect in title to, a Listed Interest of a type not described above,
the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of such Listed Interest, the portion of such Listed Interest
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of such Listed
Interest, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such
other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 



53 (vii) the Title Defect Amount with respect to any Listed Interest
shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in
another Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 

(viii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Listed Interest shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such
Listed Interest.

 

(b) The only remedy for Title Benefits is the netting against Title
Defect Amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ which is only available
for each Title Benefit Amount exceeding the Title Threshold. Each " _Title
Benefit Amount_ " shall be determined in accordance with the following
methodology, terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then such
amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in (A) the actual
Net Revenue Interest for any Well, with respect to the Target Depth for such
Well, over (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated on _Exhibit C_ for such Well
(and there is a corresponding increase in the Working Interest for such Well),
then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of (y) the Allocated Value
of such Well _multiplied_ _by_ (z) the result obtained by subtracting one (1)
from a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue
Interest for such Well, with respect to the Target Depth for such Well, and
the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest for such Well stated on
_Exhibit C_ ;

 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents an increase in (A) the actual
Net Mineral Acres covered by an Undeveloped Lease (with respect to the Target
Depth for such Undeveloped Lease) above (B) the Net Mineral Acres for such
Undeveloped Lease stated on _Exhibit C_ , then the Title Benefit Amount shall
be the product of (x) the Allocated Value of such Undeveloped Lease
_multiplied by_ (y) the result obtained by subtracting one (1) from a
fraction, the numerator of which is the actual Net Mineral Acres covered by
such Undeveloped Lease (with respect to the Target Depth for such Undeveloped
Lease) and the denominator of which is the Net Mineral Acres for such
Undeveloped Lease stated on _Exhibit C_ ; and

 

(iv) if the Title Benefit Amount cannot be calculated pursuant to
subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Listed Interest,
the portion of such Listed Interest affected by the Title Benefit, the legal
effect of the Title Benefit, the potential economic effect of the Title
Benefit over the life of the Listed Interest, the values placed upon the Title
Benefit by Buyer and Seller and such other reasonable factors as are necessary
to make a proper evaluation.

 

Section 6.6 _Notice of Environmental Defects_ _; Remedies_.

 

 (a) If Buyer discovers any Environmental Defect, then Buyer may
(but shall have no obligation to) deliver to Seller, on or prior to the
Defect Deadline, an Environmental Notice with respect to such Environmental
Defect. Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no
liability for, any Environmental Defect for which Seller has not received an
Environmental Notice on or before the Defect Deadline. For the avoidance of
doubt, if Buyer

 



54  fails to provide an Environmental Notice which satisfies the requirements
set forth in the definition of Environmental Notice, then the relevant
Environmental Defect(s) shall be deemed waived. 

(b) With respect to each Conveyed Property (other than a Buyer
Operated Property) for which Buyer has asserted an Environmental Defect
pursuant to a properly and timely delivered Environmental Notice (each such
Conveyed Property, an " _Environmental Defect Property_ "), Seller shall have
until the Defect Response Date to notify Buyer of those asserted
Environmental Defects Seller elects to attempt to cure (each, an "
_Environmental Cure Election_ ") and those asserted Environmental Defects
Seller disputes (each, an " _Environmental Dispute Election_ "). At Closing
or upon resolution of a Disputed Environmental Matter, as applicable, with
respect to each Environmental Defect Property that Seller has not cured (and
Buyer has not elected to waive in writing), the following shall apply:

(i) if the Environmental Defect Amount is equal to or greater than the
greater of (A) Allocated Value of the applicable Environmental Defect Property
and (B) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), then either Seller or Buyer
shall have the option, in its sole discretion, exclude such Environmental
Defect Property (and all related or associated Conveyed Properties) from the
Conveyed Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, in
which case, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
such Retained Property ( _provided_ , _however_ , any Conveyed Property owned
by Oakfield may not be excluded from the transactions contemplated hereby and
clause (ii) below shall apply thereto);

 

(ii) Seller shall include such Environmental Defect Property (and all
related or associated Conveyed Properties) (any such Environmental Defect
Property, together with all other such included Environmental Defect
Properties, the " _Included Environmental Defect Properties_ ") in the
Conveyed Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
in which case, (A) if Seller has not made an Environmental Cure Election or an
Environmental Dispute Election with respect to such Environmental Defect
Property prior to the Defect Response Date, the Purchase Price payable at
Closing shall be reduced by the Environmental Defect Amount for such Included
Environmental Defect Property (as determined by mutual agreement of the
Parties), (B) if Seller has made an Environmental Dispute Election with
respect to such Environmental Defect Property prior to the Defect Response
Date, the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be reduced by the
Environmental Defect Amount for such Included Environmental Defect Property
(as determined by mutual agreement of the Parties or if the Parties cannot
agree, by Buyer acting reasonably and in good faith) and at the Closing Buyer
shall deposit such amount into the Escrow Account pending the resolution of
the applicable Environmental Defect, or (C) upon resolution of a Disputed
Environmental Matter, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Environmental
Defect Amount for such Included Environmental Defect Property (as determined
by the Arbitrator); or

 

(iii) if Seller has made an Environmental Cure Election with respect to
any Environmental Defect Property prior to the Defect Response Date, such
Environmental Defect Property shall be excluded from the Conveyed Properties
conveyed by Seller to Buyer at the Closing (each, a " _Subject Environmental
Defect Property_ ") and the Purchase Price payable at Closing shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property.

 



55 (c) With respect to any Included Environmental Defect Property for
which there is a timely delivered Environmental Dispute Election, the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall apply and at the resolution of such
Disputed Environmental Matter pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, the portion
of the Allocated Value of such Included Environmental Defect Property shall be
released from the Escrow Account to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, pursuant
to the decision of the Arbitrator. If, as of the expiration of the Cure
Period, Seller has cured or partially cured (as determined by mutual agreement
of the Parties or the Arbitrator, as applicable) any Environmental Defect
affecting any Subject Environmental Defect Property that was excluded
(pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)(iii)_) from the Conveyed Properties
conveyed by Seller to Buyer at the Closing, then, (i) (A) the Purchase Price
shall be increased (as reflected on the Final Settlement Statement) by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property (or,
if the applicable Environmental Defect was only partially cured, the Purchase
Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Environmental Defect Property less an amount equal to the portion of
such Environmental Defect Amount that relates to the un-cured portion of such
Environmental Defect) or (B) if the applicable Environmental Defect was only
partially cured and the Environmental Defect Amount attributable to such un-
cured portion of such Environmental Defect exceeds the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
positive difference of an amount equal to the portion of such Environmental
Defect Amount that relates to the un-cured portion of such
Environmental Defect minus the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect
Property, and (ii) Seller shall assign to Buyer pursuant to an assignment in
substantially the same form as the Assignment, such Environmental Defect
Property (such aggregate increase or decrease to the Purchase Price pursuant
to this sentence, the " _ED Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no
event shall there be any remedies provided by Seller, and Seller shall not be
responsible for nor shall the Purchase Price be reduced for, (i) any
individual Environmental Defect for which the Environmental Defect Amount does
not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) (the " _Environmental Threshold_
") or (ii) any Environmental Defect with respect to which the Environmental
Defect Amount exceeds the Environmental Threshold, unless and until the
aggregate of (1) all such Environmental Defect Amounts that exceed the
applicable Environmental Threshold (excluding the amount of Environmental
Defect Amounts attributable to Environmental Defects that are cured by Seller
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_) and (2) all such Title Defect Amounts
that exceed the applicable Title Threshold (excluding any Title Defect Amounts
attributable to Title Defects that are cured by Seller pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 6.4(c)_ and less the aggregate of all Title Benefit Amounts that exceed
the Title Threshold), exceeds Defect Deductible, and then only with respect to
the amount of such Environmental Defect Amounts that exceed the Defect
Deductible.

Section 6.7 _Title and Environmental Dispute Resolution_. If, (1)
following Sellers Title Dispute Election or Environmental Dispute Election
delivered prior to the Defect Response Date or (2) as of the expiration of the
Cure Period to the extent related the adequacy of any curative materials
submitted to Buyer or curative work performed by Seller, the Parties cannot
agree upon (x) the existence of a Title Defect or Title Benefit, the adequacy
of any Title Defect curative materials submitted to Buyer, the Title Defect
Amount with respect to any Title Defect or the Title Benefit Amount with
respect to any Title Benefit (each, a " _Disputed Title Matter_ ") or (y) the
existence of an Environmental Defect, the adequacy of any Environmental
Defect

 



56  curative actions taken by Seller, or the Environmental Defect Amount with
respect to any Environmental Defect (each, a " _Disputed Environmental Matter_
" and, together with any Disputed Title Matter and any Disputed Accounting
Matter, a " _Disputed Matter_ "), then, in each case, the Disputed Matter
shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of
_Article XII_.

 

(a) If the Title Defect Amount of any Title Defect Property as
determined by the Arbitrator is equal to or greater than the Allocated Value
of such Title Defect Property, and (i) if Seller elects such remedy provided
in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)(i)_, then within ten (10) days after such
election, (A) such Title Defect Property shall be excluded under the terms of
this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Buyer the amount deposited in the Escrow Account with respect to
such Title Defect Property to Buyer, and Seller shall pay an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property minus such amount deposited
in the Escrow Account with respect thereto to Buyer, and (B) Buyer shall
assign to Seller such Title Defect Property pursuant to a conveyance
containing a special warranty of title, and (ii) if Seller does not elect such
remedy provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)(i)_, then within ten (10) days
following such determination by the Arbitrator, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the amount deposited in the
Escrow Account with respect to such Title Defect Property to Seller and/or
Buyer, as applicable, as would be necessary to give effect to
the Arbitrators award with respect to such Title Defect. If the Title Defect
Amount of such Title Defect Property as determined by the Arbitrator is less
than the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, then, within ten (10)
days following such determination by the Arbitrator, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the amount deposited in the
Escrow Account with respect to such Title Defect Property to Seller and/or
Buyer, as applicable, as would be necessary to give effect to the
Arbitrators award with respect to such Title Defect.

 

(b) If _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)(ii)(B)_ applies and if the Environmental
Defect Amount of any Environmental Defect Property as determined by the
Arbitrator is equal to or greater than the Allocated Value of such
Environmental Defect Property, and if a Party elects such remedy provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)(i)_, then within ten (10) days after such election, (I)
such Environmental Defect Property shall be excluded under the terms of this
Agreement, and Seller and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
deliver to Buyer the amount deposited in the Escrow Account with respect to
such Environmental Defect Property, and (II) Buyer shall assign to Seller such
Environmental Defect Property pursuant to a conveyance containing a
special warranty of title. If _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)(ii)(B)_ applies and if
the Environmental Defect Amount relating to any Environmental Defect Property
as determined by the Arbitrator is either (i) less than the Allocated Value
of such Environmental Defect Property or (ii) (A) equal to or more than the
Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property and (B) neither Party
elects the remedy under _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)(i)_ following determination by
the Arbitrator, then (in each case with respect to clause (i) and (ii)
immediately above) within ten (10) days following such determination by the
Arbitrator, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to deliver the amount deposited in the Escrow Account with respect to such
Environmental Defect Property to Seller and/or Buyer, as applicable, as would
be necessary to give effect to the Arbitrators award with respect to such
Environmental Defect.

Section 6.8 _Casualty Loss and Condemnation_. If, during the Interim
Period, all or any portion of the Conveyed Properties are destroyed or damaged
by fire, flood, earthquake,

 



57  windstorm, theft, vandalism, explosion, blowout, riot, sabotage, accident or
other casualty of a similar nature or shall be taken by condemnation or under
the right of eminent domain (each, a " _Casualty Loss_ "), and such Casualty
Loss exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), then subject to
_Section_ __ _ 13.1(c)_, Seller, at its option, may elect (a) to either (i)
reduce the Purchase Price by the amount of the Casualty Loss _less_ five
hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) or (ii) cause the Conveyed Properties
affected by any casualty or taking to be repaired or restored to at least
their condition prior to such casualty, at Sellers sole cost (as promptly as
reasonably practicable (which work may extend beyond the Closing Date), or (b)
if Buyer and Seller agree, to remove the Conveyed Properties affected by any
casualty or taking and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of
such Conveyed Property ( _provided_ , _however_ , this option may not be
elected with respect to Conveyed Properties owned by Oakfield), and in each
such case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims
against third parties with respect to such Casualty Loss except to the extent
the Parties otherwise agree in writing. If the Casualty Loss is less than five
hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), then there shall be no remedies for such
Casualty Loss.

Section 6.9 _Preferential Purchase Rights_. With respect to each
preferential purchase right, including those set forth on _Schedule 4.1(j)_ ,
Seller, within five (5) Business Days after the Execution Date, shall send to
the holder of each such preferential purchase right in accordance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such right, of the transactions
contemplated hereby. If any holder of a preferential purchase right with
respect to any of the Conveyed Properties exercises such preferential purchase
right prior to Closing, then the Conveyed Properties with respect to which
such exercised preferential purchase right relates shall be excluded from the
Conveyed Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the
Allocated Value of such Conveyed Properties (other than in the case of
Conveyed Properties owned by Oakfield which shall not be excluded from the
transactions contemplated hereby, in which case Buyer shall be obligated to
comply with the terms, and entitled to all the proceeds paid in connection
with any exercise of, any preferential purchase right applicable to such
Conveyed Properties). Should a holder of a preferential purchase right fail
to exercise its preferential purchase right as to any of the Conveyed
Properties prior to Closing and the time for exercise or waiver has not yet
expired, the affected Conveyed Properties shall not be transferred at Closing
and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Values of such
Conveyed Properties (other than in the case of Conveyed Properties owned by
Oakfield which shall not be excluded from the transactions contemplated
hereby, in which case Buyer shall be obligated to comply with the terms, and
entitled to all the proceeds paid in connection with any exercise of, any
preferential purchase right applicable to such Conveyed Properties). In the
event that such a holder exercises its preferential purchase right
following the Closing, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell or
convey the affected Conveyed Properties and Buyer shall have no further
obligation to purchase, accept or pay for such affected Conveyed Properties,
and the affected Conveyed Properties shall be excluded from the Conveyed
Properties to be acquired by Buyer at Closing hereunder. If, prior to the
expiration of the Cure Period, (a) the applicable preferential purchase right
is waived or expires without exercise by the holder thereof or (b) the holder
of a preferential purchase right with respect to any Retained Property fails
to consummate the purchase of such Retained Property in accordance with the
terms and conditions of such preferential purchase right, then, within ten
(10) Business Days of Sellers providing Buyer with notice thereof, Buyer
shall purchase (at a purchase price equal to the Allocated Value thereof,
subject to adjustments in

 



58  accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2_), and Seller shall assign to Buyer
pursuant to an assignment in substantially the same form as the Assignment,
such Retained Property.

 

Section 6.10 _Applicable Consen_ _ts_.

 

(a) With respect to each Applicable Consent, including those set forth
on  _Schedule 4.1(j)_ , Seller, within five (5) Business Days after the
Execution Date, shall send to the holder of each such Applicable Consent a
notice in compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such
Applicable Consent seeking such holders consent to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and Seller shall thereafter use commercially reasonable
efforts to procure such third party consents (other than Customary Post-
Closing Consents) necessary to transfer the Conveyed Properties to Buyer or
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Seller (such consents, the " _Applicable Consents_ ") prior to
the Closing and, with respect to any Applicable Consents not obtained (or
denied, in writing) on or prior to the Closing, until the expiration of the
Cure Period ( _provided, however_ , that Seller shall not be obligated to pay
any consideration or waive or release any right or privilege in order to
obtain any such consent). Subject to the immediately succeeding proviso,
notwithstanding the existence of an outstanding Applicable Consent with
respect to any Conveyed Property at Closing, such Conveyed Property shall
be included in the Conveyed Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant
to this Agreement at the Closing, without any reduction to the Purchase Price
with respect thereto; _provided, however_ , that, if, as of the Closing,
Seller has not obtained any Applicable Consent with respect to any Conveyed
Property and (i) the holder of such Applicable Consent is a governmental
authority, (ii) the failure to obtain such Applicable Consent would cause (x)
the assignment of the Conveyed Properties affected thereby to Buyer to be
void or voidable or (y) the termination of a Lease, Right of Way or Applicable
Contract under the express terms thereof, or (iii) such Applicable Consent
requested by Seller is denied in writing (any such Applicable Consent, a "
_Required Consent_ "), then, such Conveyed Property (and any associated Listed
Interest and other Conveyed Properties) shall not be included in the Conveyed
Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement at the
Closing (or the Parties shall take such other actions as are reasonable
necessary in order comply with the terms of the instrument creating such
Required Consent), and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the
Allocated Value of any such Listed Interest.

(b) If, as of the expiration of the Cure Period, any Required Consent
applicable to a Conveyed Property that was excluded from the Conveyed
Properties conveyed by Seller to Buyer at Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)_ has been obtained, then within five (5) Business Days of the
expiration of the Cure Period, Seller shall assign to Buyer pursuant to an
assignment in substantially the same form as the Assignment, such Conveyed
Property (and, if applicable, any associated Listed Interest and other
Conveyed Properties) and the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Conveyed Property (and, if applicable,
any associated Listed Interest and other Conveyed Properties), subject to
adjustments in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ (such amount, the " _RC
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_ ").

 

(c) If any Applicable Consent with respect to any contract or agreement
is not obtained prior to the Closing, then, until the earlier of the
expiration of the Cure Period and such time that such Applicable Consent is
obtained (or denied in writing), to the extent permissible under Law and under
the terms of such contract or agreement, Seller shall provide the benefits

 



59  and burdens of such contract or agreement to Buyer, and Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Seller for, and shall DEFEND, INDEMNIFY and HOLD HARMLESS Seller
(and each of the other Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and
all Liabilities incurred by Seller (or any of the other Seller Indemnified
Parties) in connection therewith (to the extent such Liabilities are incurred
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices, in all
material respects, or incurred in accordance with Buyers instructions),
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR
IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY
OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT
RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY OF THE SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES. With respect to any contract or agreement for which any
Applicable Consent has not been obtained as of the expiration of the Cure
Period or is denied in writing, Seller shall endeavor to mutually agree with
Buyer with respect to alternative arrangements intended to provide Buyer, to
the greatest extent possible, with the benefit and burden of any such contract
or agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ to
the contrary or the inclusion in the Assignment of any Conveyed Properties
subject to a Required Consent outstanding as of the Closing, neither this
Agreement nor the Assignment shall be deemed to provide for the conveyance of
any such Conveyed Properties to Buyer at the Closing.

 

Section 6.11 _Special Warranty_. The Assignment shall contain
a special warranty, effective as of the Closing Date and surviving
indefinitely, by which Seller warrants there is no Title Defect as to each
Undeveloped Lease and Well arising by, through or under Seller or any of its
affiliates, but not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted
Encumbrances. The Surface Deed shall contain a special warranty of title,
effective as of the Closing Date and surviving indefinitely, by which Seller
warrants title as to each applicable real property interest conveyed thereby
arising by, through or under Seller or any of its affiliates, but not
otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances. Buyer shall not
assert any claim under the special warranty of title under the Assignment with
respect to any matter for which Buyer (a) has previously asserted a claim
under _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)_ or (b) has recovered any amount under _Section_
__ _ 6.4(b)_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, for purposes of
Sellers special warranty of title in the Assignment, the aggregate value of
all claims made under the special warranty with respect to any Listed Interest
shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Listed Interest; _provided _
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Title Threshold and the Defect
Deductible shall not apply to any claim made under the special warranty in the
Assignment or the Surface Deed.

 

Section 6.12 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_ _; Waiver_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Oakfield shall be permitted to purchase,
at Sellers sole cost, a "tail" policy of directors and officers liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing with
respect to those persons who are currently covered by Oakfields directors
and officers liability insurance policy on the same terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and amount, for such individuals for six (6) years
after the Closing.

 



60 (b) Effective as of the Closing and other than any claims arising out
of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer hereby waive, on their own behalf and on
behalf of each of their respective affiliates, any and all claims against any
current or former director or officer of Oakfield in their capacity as such.

any Production Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_,
Buyer will cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed consistently with past

preparation of any such Tax Return in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.5_.
Buyer will pay all Production Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return, and to
the extent any such Taxes paid by Buyer are allocated to Seller pursuant to

Section 7.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. After the Closing,
upon reasonable notice, Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate, and afford or
cause to be afforded to each other and their representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the personnel (without substantial

Conveyed Properties and Oakfield that are necessary or useful in connection
with: (i) the filing of any Tax Return, any amended Tax Return, Tax election

Conveyed Properties or Oakfield; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
assistance do not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Buyer or
Seller and documents requested by Buyer or Seller shall require a reasonable
business purpose and shall be limited to those documents that reasonably
relate to such purpose. In the event that documents requested by a
Party include information that does not relate to the

 



62  Conveyed Properties or Oakfield, then the other Party shall be permitted to
redact such information in such documents. The Party requesting such
personnel, books, records, and information shall bear all of the out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of the other Party reasonably incurred in connection
with providing such personnel, books, records, and information. Each Party
shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and all material records or other

Conveyed Properties or Oakfield for any Tax period or portion thereof
beginning on or before the Closing and ending after the Closing, until the
expiration of the relevant statute of limitations (including extensions) to
which such Tax Returns and other documents relate.

 

Section 7.6 _Like Kind Exchange_. Buyer and Seller agree that
either Party (the " _Exchange Party_ ") may reasonably request cooperation of
the other Party (the " _Cooperating Party_ ") in completing a like-kind
exchange which will qualify for treatment as a tax deferred exchange pursuant
to the provisions of Section 1031 of the Code (a " _1031 Exchange_ "). The
Cooperating Party shall provide reasonable cooperation requested by the
Exchange Party in implementing the 1031 Exchange. This cooperation shall not
subject Cooperating Party to any additional liability beyond its existing
obligations under this Agreement. The Exchange Party shall indemnify the
Cooperating Party against any and all costs and expenses incurred with
respect to furnishing such cooperation and reimburse the Cooperating Party,
upon demand, for any increased expense incurred by the Cooperating Party
relating to the 1031 Exchange. Cooperating Party shall not be obligated to
take title to any property, other than the Conveyed Properties, in the case
of Buyer. A 1031 Exchange shall not delay the Closing. The accomplishment of
the 1031 Exchange is not a condition to the Exchange Partys obligations under
this Agreement. The Exchange Partys failure to locate an exchange property
or to consummate a like-kind exchange for any reason or for no reason at all
(other than on account of Cooperating Partys material breach of this
Agreement) shall in no way relieve the Exchange Party of its obligations
under this Agreement. Neither Party represents to the other that any
particular tax treatment will be given to either Party as a result of the
like-kind exchange.

 

Section 7.7 _Tax Refund_. The amount of any refunds of
Production Taxes of Oakfield for any Tax Period ending prior to the Effective
Time shall be for the account of Seller. The amount of any refunds of
Production Taxes of Oakfield for any Tax Period beginning at or after the
Effective Time shall be for the account of Buyer. If a Party receives a
refund (whether by way of refund, credit, offset or otherwise) of Production
Taxes to which the other Party is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.7_, or of any Production Taxes that are allocated to the other Party
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the recipient Party shall promptly pay such
amount to the other Party, net of any reasonable costs or expenses incurred by
such Party or its affiliates in procuring such refund.

were received by such other Party, reimburse the Party which paid such
Property Costs, (iii) if a Party or any of its affiliates receives an invoice
of a Property Cost which is owed by the other Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.2(b)_, such Party receiving the invoice shall promptly forward such invoice
to the Party obligated to pay the same, and (iv) if an invoice for Property
Costs is received by a Party or any of its affiliates, which is partially an
obligation of both Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)_, then the
Parties shall consult with each other, and each shall promptly pay its
portion of such Property Costs to the obligee thereof.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, subject

Buyer, including the Excluded Assets. From and after the Closing, at
the request of Buyer but without further consideration, Seller shall execute
and deliver or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and

cease using the Seller Marks in any manner, directly or indirectly, and

transaction contemplated hereunder and all costs and fees associated
therewith.

Buyer will discontinue all use of "Oakfield", "Oakfield Energy" or "Oakfield
Gathering System" alone or in any combination of any words or marks
confusingly similar thereto, and will as promptly as possible, but in no event
later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, eliminate such names from

certificate of formation in proper form for filing with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, changing Oakfields name to a name not similar to
"Oakfield Energy

 



70  LLC," together with all other documentation required to be filed in other
jurisdictions where Oakfield is qualified or licensed to do business to
reflect such name change.

exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for
purposes of determining the amount of Liability for which any Party is
obligated to indemnify or entitled to indemnity under _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ (but not for the purpose of determining whether
or not a representation or warranty has been breached), qualifiers as to
materiality or material adverse effect set forth in any such representation
or warranty herein shall be disregarded.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Seller
shall not be required to indemnify Buyer under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ for
any Production Tax (or portion thereof) allocable to Buyer under _Section_ __
_ 7.1_ as a result of a breach by Seller of any representation or warranty
set forth in _Sections 4.1(f)_ or _4.1(u)(vi)_ , except to the extent the
amount of such Production Tax (or portion thereof) (i) exceeds the amount that
would have been due absent such breach or (ii) was taken into account as an
increase to the Purchase Price under _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, _9.1(a)_ or _10.2_
, as applicable.

 

Section 11.4 _Notice of Claim for Indemnification_. Each indemnified
party hereunder agrees that upon its discovery of facts giving rise to a
claim for indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, including receipt
by it of notice of any demand, assertion, action or proceeding, judicial or
otherwise by any third party with respect to any matter to which it believes
itself to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it
shall give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party,
together with a statement of such information regarding any of the foregoing
as it shall then have; _provided_ that the failure of any indemnified party to
give notice of a claim shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its
obligations under this _Article XI_ except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying partys ability to defend against the
claim. Such notice shall include a formal demand for indemnification under
this Agreement. To the extent a Survival Period is applicable to such claim
for indemnity, Buyer must provide any such notice within the Survival Period,
otherwise all indemnifications granted by Seller hereunder shall terminate and
expire. In the event that the indemnifying party admits its obligation to
defend the indemnified party against such claim at the sole cost and expense
of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall afford the indemnifying
party a reasonable opportunity to pay, settle or contest the claim at the
indemnifying partys expense;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying
party shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified party, (a)
settle any third party claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written release of
the indemnified party from all liability in respect of such third party claim
or (b) settle any third party claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect
the indemnified party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity). With respect to any claim subject to indemnification pursuant to
this _Article XI_ or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, the indemnified
party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate (at the
indemnifying partys sole cost and

 



73  expense) with the indemnifying party in asserting any defense that may be
available to the indemnified party with respect to any such claim.

 

Section 11.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. If the Closing occurs, the
indemnity obligations set forth in this Agreement shall be the exclusive
remedies for the Parties for the breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant set forth in this Agreement or any claim arising out of, resulting
from or related to the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Party
hereby releases, waives and discharges, and covenants not to sue (and shall
cause its affiliates to waive, discharge and covenant not to sue) with respect
to, any cause of action not expressly provided for in this Agreement,
including claims under state or federal securities Laws and claims available
at common law, in equity or by statute, including rescission.

 

Section 11.6 _Extent of Indemnification_. THE INDEMNIFICATION
AND ASSUMPTION PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE
WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES IN QUESTION AROSE OUT OF OR RESULTED FROM,
SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF
LAW OF OR BY ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY,
EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT RESULTING FROM THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT
OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

Section 11.7 _Losses_. In the event a Party is obligated to make
payments to the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as
the case may be, any such amounts shall be net of any (a) insurance proceeds
realized by and paid to any Person in respect of or related to the event,
cause or condition giving rise thereto, and (b) amounts actually recovered
from third parties with respect to such event, cause or condition giving rise
thereto, in any case, after giving effect to any expenditures to obtain such
payments and any applicable deductible or retention and resulting
retrospective premium adjustment.

 

Section 11.8 _Claimants_. Any claim for indemnity under this
_Article XI_ by any current or former affiliate, assignee, stockholder,
member, officer, director, employee, agent, lender, advisor, representative,
accountant, attorney, or consultant of any Party must be brought and
administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No indemnified party
other than Seller and Buyer shall have any rights against either Seller or
Buyer under the terms of this _Article XI_ except as may be exercised on its
behalf by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this _Article XI_.
Seller and Buyer may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights
under this _Article XI_ on behalf of the other Seller Indemnified Parties and
Buyer Indemnified Parties, respectively, affiliated with it in its sole
discretion and shall have no liability to any such other indemnified party for
any action or inaction under this _Section_ __ _ 11.8_.

select a mutually agreeable single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney
with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles involving
properties in the regional area in which the Conveyed Properties are located,
within fifteen (15) days after the Defect Response Date or, if Seller has
elected to cure in accordance with this Agreement (including the making of
such election following the delivery of a Title Dispute Election), the
expiration of the Cure Period, as applicable. With respect to any Disputed
Environmental Matter, the Parties shall select a mutually agreeable single
arbitrator, who shall be an environmental consultant with at least ten (10)
years experience, within fifteen (15) days of the Defect Response Date or,

expiration of the Cure Period, as applicable. With respect any Disputed
Accounting Matter, the Parties shall select a mutually agreeable single
arbitrator, who shall be an accountant at a regionally recognized independent
national accounting firm with at least ten (10) years of relevant experience,
within fifteen (15) days of the Final Settlement Statement Cut-Off Date. If
the Parties have not selected a mutually agreeable arbitrator in accordance
with the provisions and deadlines set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(b)_,
then such arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules (" _Rules_ ") of the American Arbitration Association ("
_AAA_ ") (the arbitrator selected in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
12.1(b)_, the " _Arbitrator_ ").

 

(c) The Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20)
days after submission of the Disputed Matters to the Arbitrator and shall be
binding on and non-appealable by the Parties.

 

(d) In making his determination with respect to any Disputed Matter,
the Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in _Article III_ or _VI_
, as applicable, and the other terms hereof and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Arbitrator are necessary
to make a proper determination; _provided, however,_ that with respect to any
Disputed Matter related to any Title Defect Amount, Title Benefit Amount or
Environmental Defect Amount, the Arbitrator shall not award Buyer (or Seller,
if applicable) a greater amount than the amount claimed by Buyer (or Seller,
if applicable) in its Title Notice or Environmental Notice, as applicable.

 

(e) With respect to any Disputed Matter, the Arbitrator shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining such specific Disputed Matter,
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect
to any Disputed Matter. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
the Arbitrator may, however, award reasonable costs, including attorney fees
and fees and expenses associated with the Arbitrator, to the Party determined
by the Arbitrator to be the prevailing Party in the arbitration of any
Disputed Matter. Within ten (10) days after the Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Buyer and

 



75  Seller of such award, (A) Buyer shall pay (without duplication) to Seller

shall pay (without duplication) to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by

the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 12.4 _Jurisdiction of Provisions_. The Arbitrator shall not

the provisions of this Agreement. Pending the final decision of the Arbitrator
of any Disputed Matter, both Parties will proceed diligently with performance
of all contractual obligations, including the payment of all sums not in
dispute, required by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parties reserve the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for
the purpose of obtaining security or other provisional relief to satisfy or
effectuate an eventual arbitration award, including attachment and injunctive
relief. The commencement of any action for such relief in aid of arbitration
shall not constitute a waiver of the right to arbitration nor shall it
prejudice in any way the right to proceed to arbitration.

 

Section 12.5 _Written Decision or Award_. The written decision or award
of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Parties and the Parties
shall abide by and comply with such decision and a judgment may be rendered
upon such decision or award in a court of competent jurisdiction. Unless
apportioned otherwise by the Arbitrator under _Section_ __ _ 12.1_ or _12.6_
, Buyer and Seller shall equally bear the cost of the services and expenses of
the Arbitrator and all other costs of the arbitration proceedings.

 

Section 12.6 _Authority of Arbitrator_. The Arbitrator shall be
authorized to consider only issues that this Agreement expressly requires to
be submitted to arbitration. The Arbitrator shall have the authority to
determine whether the Arbitrator is authorized by this Agreement to consider a
matter submitted for arbitration. If the Arbitrator concludes that he has no
such authority, he shall cease consideration of that matter and so notify both
Parties. The Arbitrator shall have the authority to equitably apportion the
costs and expenses of any arbitration between Buyer and Seller. The
Arbitrator shall have no authority to award incidental, indirect, special,
consequential (including lost profits or other consequential or business
interruption damages or any other damages not measured by actual
damages), multiple, statutory, punitive or exemplary damages with respect to
any dispute arising under, related to, or in connection with this Agreement,
the breach hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. This limitation of
losses and damages shall apply to any arbitration no matter when the
proceeding is initiated and shall survive the termination of this Agreement
without limit.

not satisfied (or waived in writing by Buyer) as of the Closing Deadline;
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer shall not be permitted to terminate this

this Agreement and such breach is the cause of or has resulted in the failure
of any condition in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ to be satisfied;

 

(c) by either Party, in its sole and absolute discretion, upon written
notice to the other Party, if, as of the scheduled date of Closing, the sum

Section 13.2 _Effect of Termination_. Without limiting Sellers
and Buyers respective remedies and rights in regard to the Performance
Deposit under _Section_ __ _ 13.3_, in the event of termination of this
Agreement by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 13.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by
the terminating Party to the other Party, and this Agreement shall thereupon
terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) _ Section_ __ _ 3.1_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.4_, _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(f)_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 11.6_,
this _Article XIII_ and _Article_ __ _ XIV_ will survive the termination of
this Agreement and will remain in full force and effect and (ii) subject to

to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the governmental authority to
which they were made.

 



77 Section 13.3 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Seller_ __ _s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, if Seller is entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.1(a)_ because of the failure of Buyer to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the instance where, as of
the Closing Deadline, (i) all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of Buyer set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ (other than those actions or
deliveries to occur at Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of
other conditions precedent set forth in _Article VIII_ at Closing) have been
met, or waived in writing by Buyer, and (ii) Seller is ready, willing and able
to perform its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ (a " _Buyer Closing
Breach_ "), Seller, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the
Agreement and retain the Performance Deposit, free of any claims by Buyer with
respect thereto, as liquidated damages. All other remedies are hereby
expressly waived by Seller. IT IS EXPRESSLY STIPULATED BY THE PARTIES THAT THE
ACTUAL AMOUNT OF DAMAGES RESULTING FROM SUCH TERMINATION WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF
NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE ACCURATELY BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE NATURE OF
THIS AGREEMENT, THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE OIL AND GAS INTERESTS, THE
UNCERTAINTIES OF APPLICABLE COMMODITY MARKETS AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH MATTERS, AND THAT THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN
ARE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE BY THE PARTIES OF SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY.

 

(b) _Buyer_ __ _s Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth herein, if Buyer is entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.1(b)_ because of the failure of Seller to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the instance where, as of
the Closing Deadline, (i) all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of Seller set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ (other than those actions or
deliveries to occur at Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of other
conditions precedent set forth in _Article VIII_ at Closing) have been met, or
waived in writing by Seller, and (ii) Buyer is ready, willing and able to
perform its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, Buyer, as its sole and
exclusive remedy, may either (A) enforce specific performance of this
Agreement or (B) terminate this Agreement and receive back the entirety of the
Performance Deposit, free of any claims by Seller with respect thereto (in
which case Seller shall promptly return the Performance Deposit to Buyer). All
other remedies are hereby expressly waived by Buyer.

 

(c) _Termination Without Breach_. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated under _Section_ __ _ 13.1_ under circumstances other than
those described in _Section_ __ _ 13.3(a)_ or _(b)_ , Buyer shall be entitled
to receive back the entirety of the Performance Deposit, free of any claims
by Seller with respect thereto.

Section 13.4 _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 21,
2017, by and between WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (an affiliate
of Seller) and QEMVII, LLC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain
in effect following the Execution Date and any termination of this Agreement
in accordance with this _Article XIII_ ; _provided_ that, __ if the Closing
shall occur, then, except with respect to any portion of the Conveyed
Properties not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
and the Excluded Assets, the Confidentiality

 



78 Agreement shall terminate (or the Parties shall cause it to be terminated) as
of the Closing and be of no further force and effect thereafter.

Agreement may be amended, modified or waived, except by an instrument in
writing executed, by Buyer and Seller in the case of amendment or
modification, or, in the case of a waiver, by the Party to whom the obligation

Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, and in
case of any such invalidity, this Agreement shall be construed as if the
invalid provision had not been included herein.

 

Section 14.3 _Assignment_. Except in connection with a 1031 Exchange or

Agreement may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written

consent of Seller.

 

Section 14.4 _Interpretation_.

this Agreement are for guidance and convenience of reference only and shall
not limit or otherwise affect the interpretation of any of the terms or

80 (c) _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules
attached to or referred to in this Agreement are incorporated into and made a

a way as to make its relevance or applicability to information called for by
another Schedule or other Schedules reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure shall be deemed to be disclosed on such other Schedule or
Schedules, as the case may be, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or
cross-reference thereto.

(d) _Not to be Construed Against Drafter_. The Parties acknowledge
that they have had an adequate opportunity to review each and every provision
contained in this Agreement and to submit the same to legal counsel for review
and comment, including the waivers and indemnities contained herein. Based on

contained in this Agreement. Based on the foregoing, the Parties agree that
the rule of construction that a contract be construed against the drafter, if
any, shall not be applied in the interpretation and construction of this
Agreement.

 

(e) _Time for Performance_. This Agreement contains a number of dates
and times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the
Parties intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final
date and time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and
relinquishes any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to
meet any performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis
that its late action constitutes substantial performance, to require the other
Party to show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds. Without limiting the
foregoing, time is of the essence in this Agreement. If any time period
hereunder expires on, or the date for or deadline for performance of any
obligations or delivery of any notice hereunder falls on, a day which is not
a Business Day, unless otherwise provided for herein, then the date of
expiration of any such time period, or the date for or deadline for
performance of any such obligation or delivery of any such notice hereunder,

implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person (other than the Parties,
and their respective successors and permitted assigns) any benefits, rights or
remedies.

the failure of a Party to insist on the strict performance of any provision of
this Agreement or to exercise any right, power or remedy upon a breach thereof
shall not constitute a waiver of any provisions of this Agreement or limit
such Partys right thereafter to enforce any provision or exercise any right.

 

Section 14.11 _Conspicuousness of Provisions_. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the provisions contained in this Agreement that are set out in
"bold" and/or all capital letters satisfy the requirement of the "express

Section 14.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by Seller
and Buyer in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original instrument, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. Facsimile and electronic (i.e., pdf transmission) signature
