cooperation shall not subject Cooperating Party to any additional liability beyond its existing obligations under this Agreement. The Exchange Party shall indemnify the Cooperating Party against any and all costs and expenses incurred with respect
to furnishing such cooperation and reimburse the Cooperating Party, upon demand, for any increased expense incurred by the Cooperating Party relating to the 1031 Exchange. Cooperating Party shall not be obligated to take title to any property, other
