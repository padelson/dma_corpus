ARTICLE 2

  

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

  

2.1 _Sale and Transfer of Shares_.  Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i) Purchaser hereby purchases from
FiberMark International, and FiberMark International hereby sells, and will
convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Purchaser at the Closing (but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_
and _7.2_ hereof, and subject to the registration of the Purchaser as limited
partner in the commercial register by way of special succession ("
_Sonderrechtsnachfolge_ ")) the FiberMark International Held Interest, free
and clear of all Liens, and (ii) Purchaser hereby purchases from Parent, and
Parent hereby sells and will convey, assign, transfer and deliver at the
Closing to Purchaser (but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ hereof), the FiberMark
Investments Shares, including all rights to dividends not yet distributed,
free and clear of all Liens. The sale and purchase of the
FiberMark International Held Interest shall include the balances in all
Partner Accounts of FiberMark International in the Company.  At any time
prior to Closing, FiberMark International and FiberMark Investments shall be
entitled to withdraw all balances in their respective Private Accounts in the
Company.

  

2.2 _Purchase Price_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, in consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer and delivery to Purchaser of the FiberMark International
Held Interest and the FiberMark Investments Shares, the Purchaser shall pay
to the Sellers the FiberMark Investments Purchase Price and the Preliminary
Purchase Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in _Section 2.3_.

     

   

2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  

(a) _Preparation of the Final Closing Statement_.

  

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than sixty days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers a statement (the
" _Proposed Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Purchasers determination
of (1) the Net Working Capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ") and (2) Cash of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Cash_ ").

  

(ii) If the Sellers disagree with the Purchasers calculation of the Closing
Working Capital or the Closing Cash, the Sellers shall promptly, but in no
event later than twenty Business Days after receiving the Proposed Closing
Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") deliver to the Purchaser written notice
describing in reasonable detail their dispute by specifying those items or
amounts as to which the Sellers disagree, together with the Sellers
determination of such disputed items and amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ ");
_provided_ , that the Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with all items
and amounts that are not disputed in the Dispute Notice. If the Sellers either
give notice that they agree with the Purchasers calculation of the Closing
Working Capital and Closing Cash or fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within
the Review Period, the Purchaser and the Seller agree that the Proposed
Closing Statement shall be deemed to set forth (1) the Closing Working
Capital and shall constitute the " _Final Net Working Capital_ " for purposes
of _Section 2.3(b)_, and (2) the Closing Cash and shall constitute the Final
Closing Cash (as defined below) for purposes of _Section 2.3(b)_.

  

If the Sellers deliver a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser within the Review
Period, the Sellers and the Purchaser will use reasonable good faith efforts
to resolve the dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date the
Sellers deliver the Dispute Notice to the Selling Parties. If the Purchaser
and the Sellers are not able to resolve all disputed items within such 30-day
period, then the items in dispute shall be submitted immediately to the New
York office of Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting
Firm shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to calculate the Closing Working Capital and/or the
Closing Cash. Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers will be afforded an
opportunity to present to the Accounting Firm any material relating to the
determination of the matters set forth in the Dispute Notice and to discuss
such matters with the Accounting Firm.  The Accounting Firm shall be
instructed to promptly deliver to the other party copies of all documents and
other data made available by the Sellers or the Purchaser to the Accounting
Firm.  The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator
to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of the Sellers, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other, and not by independent
investigation, the Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash and shall
be instructed that its calculation (A) with respect to Closing Working
Capital, must be made in accordance with the standards and definitions in
this Agreement and Exhibit A, and (B) with respect to each item in dispute,
must be within the range of values established for such amount as determined
by reference to the value assigned to such amount by the Sellers in the
Dispute Notice and by the Sellers in the Proposed Closing Statement. The
Accounting Firm shall submit such calculation to the Sellers and the
Purchaser as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days
after the remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm.
The determination by the Accounting Firm of the Closing Working Capital and
the Closing Cash as set forth in a written notice delivered to the Purchaser
and the Sellers by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement
absent manifest error will be binding and conclusive on the Purchaser and
the Sellers. Closing Working Capital as determined after all disputes have
been resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.3 (a)(ii) _is referred to
herein as the " _Final Net Working_

   

9   

 

  

 _Capital_ " and Closing Cash as determined after all disputes have been
resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.3(a)(ii) _is referred to herein
as the " _Final Closing Cash_ ".

  

(iii) In the event Purchaser and the Sellers submit any unresolved objections
to an Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in _Section 2.3(a)(ii)
_above, the fees and expenses of such Accounting Firm will be borne pro rata
as determined by the Accounting Firm by the Purchaser and the Sellers based
on the amount of deviation of the determination of Closing Working Capital
and Closing Cash, as set forth in the Dispute Notice and the Proposed Closing
Statement, respectively, from the determination of Final Net Working Capital
and Final Closing Cash made by the Accounting Firm.

  

(iv) The Purchaser will cause the Company to make its financial records and
relevant personnel available to the Sellers and their accountants and other
representatives at reasonable times during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on date of the final determination of the Final Net
Working Capital and Final Closing Cash pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)(ii)
_above.

  

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  

(i) If the Final Net Working Capital as determined in accordance with
_Section 2.3(a)(ii) _exceeds the Reference Working Capital, Purchaser shall
pay to the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more accounts designated by the Sellers the amount by which the Final Net
Working Capital exceeds the Reference Working Capital plus any interest
accruing on such amount at the Reference Rate beginning on the Closing Date
through the date of payment.

  

(ii) If the Final Closing Cash as determined in accordance with _Section
2.3(a)(ii) _is positive, Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by the
Sellers the amount by which the Final Closing Cash is greater than zero plus
interest accruing on such amount at the Reference Rate beginning on the
Closing Date through the date of payment.

  

(iii) Any Net Working Capital Shortfall and any Closing Cash Shortfall
(together, the " _Shortfall_ "), which amount shall include interest accruing
on such funds in the Preliminary Purchase Price Escrow Account (the rate of
such interest accruals being the " _Reference Rate_ ") beginning on the
Closing Date through the date of payment, shall be released to the Purchaser
from the Preliminary Purchase Price Escrow Account, and the remaining amount,
if any, in the Purchase Price Escrow Account shall be released to one or more
accounts designated by the Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Shortfall exceeds the amount on deposit in the Preliminary Purchase Price
Escrow Account, such excess shall be payable by the Sellers.

  

(iv) Any adjustment payment pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be paid
within three Business Days after the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital and the Final Closing Cash pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_.

  

(v) Any right of the Purchaser to set-off and/or to withhold any adjustment
payment pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be prohibited unless Purchasers
respective set-off claim is undisputed or has been confirmed by final court
decision.

  

The Preliminary Purchase Price shall be adjusted in accordance with the
aggregate amount paid (A) to the Sellers pursuant to _Sections 2.3(b)(i)
_and  _2.3(b)(ii)_ , which amount shall increase the

     

   

Preliminary Purchase Price, or (B) to the Purchaser pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)(iii)_, which amount shall reduce the Preliminary Purchase Price.  The
Preliminary Purchase Price as so adjusted is referred to herein as the "
_Final Purchase Price_ ".

  

2.4 _Purchaser Indemnity_. The Purchaser shall not take any action with
respect to FiberMark International and FiberMark Investments and their
respective Subsidiaries that may result in a claim against the Sellers under
Sec. 172 para. 4 of the HGB or Sections 30 and 31 of the German Act on
Limited Liability Companies (GmbHG) with respect to the FiberMark
International Held Interest. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers against all Losses resulting from any such claim.

(i) cooperation in the preparation and filing of any filings that may be

actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable
date of all of the

     

   

conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) promptly notify the other party upon
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or non-
occurrence would be reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing.

  

6.7 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided
to them in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby is subject to the terms of the confidentiality agreement between the

 Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

  

6.8 _Preservation of Records_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company
to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the respective
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a period of five (5) years
from the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law) and shall
make such records and personnel available to the Parent and its Affiliates,
at such Partys expense, as may be reasonably required by such party in
connection with, among other things, any insurance claims by, Legal
Proceedings or Tax audits against or governmental investigations of
the Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  

6.9 _Change of Recordals; Change of Name_.

  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to effect the necessary change of recordals with all patent and
trademark offices and other similar authorities where material
Intellectual Property of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (i) is still
recorded in the name of legal predecessors of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) where, to the Knowledge of the Parent, the relevant
recordals of the patent and trademark offices and other similar authorities
are materially incorrect for any other reason.

  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will take all
actions necessary to change the name of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries containing the word " _FiberMark_ " to delete any references to
such word.

  

(c) The Seller shall grant to the Purchaser a fully paid license to utilize
the " _FiberMark_ " business name on existing products solely in a manner
consistent with that in effect as of the Closing Date, and such license term
shall be in effect for one (1) year after the Closing Date; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cease utilizing the " _FiberMark_ " business name prior to the
expiration of the above mentioned one (1) year license.

  

6.10 _338 Election_.

  

(a) At Purchasers option, Purchaser shall make an election under Section
338(g) of the Code with respect to any one or more of FiberMark Investments
and the Company, (all elections made pursuant to this sentence, collectively,
the " _Section 338 Election_"). The Section 338 Election shall
properly reflect the Price Allocation (as hereinafter defined). Within 120
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers a
statement (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") containing Purchasers good faith
determination of (i) the ADSP (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338-4) for each of the entities in respect of which the
Section 338 Election is made and (ii) an allocation of the ADSP for each such
entity among the assets of that entity, each in accordance with the Treasury
Regulations under Section 338 of the Code. If within 30 days after receipt
of the Allocation Statement the Sellers notify Purchaser in writing that the
allocation of one or more items reflected in the Allocation Statement is not
a reasonable allocation, then Purchaser and the Sellers will negotiate in
good

     

   

faith to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and the Sellers fail to
resolve such dispute within 30 days, then Purchaser and the Sellers shall
submit such dispute to the Accounting Firm which shall determine whether the
allocation of the items in question was reasonable and, if not reasonable,
shall appropriately revise the Allocation Statement.  If the Sellers do not
respond within 30 days, or upon resolution of the disputed items, the
allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement (as such may have been
adjusted) shall be the "Price Allocation" and shall be binding on the parties
hereto. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to act, and to cause their
respective Affiliates to act, in accordance with the Price Allocation in the
preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return.

  

(b) In the event that Purchaser does not make the 338 Election with respect
to the Company or FiberMark Investments, Purchaser shall not cause or permit
the Company or FiberMark Investments to make any distribution with respect to
stock (or any transfer that could be treated as a distribution with respect
to stock under Section 301 of the Code) until the first day of the taxable
year of the Company (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that
begins after the Closing Date, it being understood that at present the
Companys and FiberMark Investments taxable year-end is December 31.

  

(c) The Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser to cause the entities listed
in clause (iii) of the first sentence of _Section 4.11(c)_  each to make an
election under Section 754 of the Code that is effective for the period that
includes the Closing Date.

  

6.11 _Publicity_.

  

(a) No party to this Agreement shall issue any press release or public
announcement or comment concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, unless, in the judgment of the Purchaser or Parent disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Parent or under the rules of any securities exchange on which the
securities of the Purchaser are listed, _provided_ that, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law
to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

  

Each of Purchaser and Parent agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall
not be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public and that copies of
this Agreement shall not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the
public, except where such disclosure, availability or filing is required by
applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law or under the rules
of any securities exchange on which the securities of the Purchaser are
listed.

  

6.12 _Financial Statements_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
procure the consent of KPMG to the inclusion of financial statements of the
Company for the three years ended December 31, 2005 in filings of Purchaser
Parent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to the extent
required by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. Such financial statements have
been previously delivered to Purchaser.

  

6.13 _Non-competition_. From the Closing Date and until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers will not and will cause their
existing and future Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly anywhere in
Europe, engage in any of the business activities conducted by the Company as
of the date of this Agreement (other than activities (including derivatives
thereof and improvements thereon) being conducted on the date hereof by
Parent and its Subsidiaries, (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries));
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers and their
Subsidiaries may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment,
securities of any Person that are traded on any

     

   

recognized securities exchange if neither Sellers nor any of
their Subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, (1) is an Affiliate of
such Person or (2) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, five (5)
percent or more of any class of securities of such Person.

  

6.14 _Release of Liens_. Parent shall ensure the removal, on or prior to the
Closing Date, of (i) all Liens on any equity interests to be acquired
directly or indirectly by Purchaser via the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, equity interests in Joint Ventures
and Subsidiaries, (ii) all Liens set forth on Schedules 4.9(e)(ii) and
4.15(a)(vii), (iii) all land charges ( _Grundschulden_ ) set forth on Schedule
4.12(ii) as shown by the land register excerpts contained in Schedule 4.12
(iii) as being registered in department III ( _Abteilung III_ ) of the
relevant land register (provided, however, that the removal of each such land
charge shall be deemed to have occurred upon submission to the relevant land
register of (x) an irrevocable application for its deletion _(L
oschungsantrag)_ and (y) the consent to its deletion by its beneficiary or
beneficiaries _(L oschungsbewilligung des oder der Berechtigten) _without any
outstanding trust instructions ( _Treuhandauflagen_ ), each in the form (
_grundbuchm aßige Form_) required by Section 29 German Land Register
Ordinance ( _Grundbuchordnung_ ), and (z) the notary in charge of the
deletion procedure has assumed liability for deletion fees on behalf of the
respective entities owning the respective encumbered real estate properties
vis-a-vis the competent land registers), and (iv) all guarantees set forth on
Schedule 4.15(a)(vi) and (vii).

their covenants hereunder, and if such violation (if curable) is not cured
within twenty (20) days after the giving of written notice by Purchaser to
the Parent or (ii) there has been any event, change, occurrence or
circumstance that renders the condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ incapable
of being satisfied by the Outside Date; or

  

(e) by the Parent if (i) Purchaser shall be in material violation of any of
its covenants hereunder, and if such violation (if curable) is not cured
within twenty (20) days after the giving of written notice by the Parent to
Purchaser or (ii) there shall have been any event, change, occurrence or
circumstance that would prohibit or preclude the ability of the Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

8.2 _Procedure Upon Termination_.  In the event of termination and
abandonment by Purchaser or Parent or both, pursuant to _Section 8.1_
hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or
parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the transaction shall be
abandoned, without further action by Purchaser or Parent.

  

8.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, then each of the parties shall
be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement
after the date of such termination and such termination shall be without
liability to Purchaser or Parent; _provided_ , that no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for any willful breach of this
Agreement.

  

ARTICLE 9

  

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

  

9.1 _Survival of Representations_.  The representations and warranties set
forth in _Sections 4.2_,  _4.4_ , _4.7_ and _5.2_ shall survive the Closing
indefinitely; representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.11_
(except for _Sections 4.11(c)(i)_ and _(ii))_ shall survive until 60
(sixty) calendar days after the expiration of all applicable statute of
limitations (including all periods of extension, whether automatic or
permissive); representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.21_ shall
survive the Closing for 3 years after the Closing Date; and all other
representations and warranties and covenants of the parties hereto contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant
hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing until the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Indemnity Period_ "). No claim for
breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant,
agreement or obligation may be asserted after the expiration of the Indemnity
Period; _provided_ , that the written assertion prior to expiration of the
Indemnity Period of any claim by a party for indemnification hereunder with
respect to the breach or alleged breach of any representation or warranty or
the failure or alleged failure to perform any covenant or other obligation,
which assertion specifies the underlying facts supporting the claim as
opposed to general assertions of a breach, shall survive until
final resolution of such claim.

     

   

9.2 _General Indemnification_.

  

(a) If, after the Closing Date, Purchaser and/or its officers, directors
and/or Affiliates (each a " _Purchaser Indemnitee_ " and together the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") suffer any damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, claims of any kind, interest or expenses (but
excluding consequential damages ( _Folgeschaeden_ ) or loss of profits (
_entgangener Gewinn_ )) (" _Loss_ ") as a result of (i) the failure of any
representation or warranty made by the Sellers in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement to be true and correct as of
the date made ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for the purposes of this
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_, in determining whether there has been a breach of any
such warranty or representation, if any such warranty or representation is
qualified in any respect by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, such
qualifications or exceptions will be ignored), and (ii) any breach by the
Sellers of any of their covenants or agreements contained herein which are to
be performed by the Sellers on or before the Closing Date, then, subject to
the other provisions of this _Article 9_, and except as set forth in
_Section 9.4(f)_ and the last sentence of _Section 9.6(h)_ , such Purchaser
Indemnitee(s) shall be entitled to be reimbursed the amount of such Loss
solely from the Escrow Account or by drawing on the General Credit Support,
as the case may be.

  

(b) After the Closing, Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the
Sellers and/or their respective officers, directors and/or Affiliates (each a
" _Seller Indemnitee_ " and together the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") harmless
from any Loss suffered or paid, directly or indirectly, as a result of (i)
the failure of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this
Agreement to be true and correct as of the date made, (ii) any breach by
Purchaser of any of its covenants or agreements contained herein and (iii)
any breach by the Company of any of its covenants or agreements contained
herein which are to be performed by the Company after the Closing Date.

  

9.3 _Third Party Claims_.

  

(a) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") is made against any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ hereof (an " _Indemnified Party_ "), and if such Indemnified
Party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this _Article 9_,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Party obligated to indemnify
such Indemnified Party (or, in the case of a Purchaser Indemnitee seeking
indemnification, such Purchaser Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Parent)
(such notified party, the " _Responsible Party_ ") of such claims; _provided_
that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is
actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

  

(b) The Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such
notice to assume the conduct and control, through counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the expense of the Responsible Party,
of the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_ that the Responsible
Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party, and further
_provided_ that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such
Indemnified Party. So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably contesting
any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle
any such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to pay or settle any such claim (whether or not appropriate
notice has been given by Indemnified Party), _provided_  that in such event
it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Responsible Party or
from the Escrow Account or by drawing on the General Credit Support, as the
case may be, for such claim unless the Responsible Party shall have consented
to such payment or settlement. If (and only if) the Responsible Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder
that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to 

     

   

contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive any right
to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(c) The Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and shall furnish such records, information and testimony,
and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and
appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

9.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_ Except for the right to
indemnification set forth in _Section 9.6_ (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not be subject to the following limitations), the rights of the
Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 9.2(a)_ are subject to the following limitations:

  

(a) the amount of any and all Losses will be determined net of (i) any
specific accruals or specific reserves on the Balance Sheet, (ii) any amounts
recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees under indemnification agreements or
arrangements with third parties or under insurance policies with respect to
such Losses (each such source named in this clause (ii) a " _Collateral
Source_ ") and (iii) an amount equal to the net present value (to be
calculated using a discount factor of 6% per annum) of any net Tax benefits
(it being understood that net tax benefits shall be computed on a
hypothetical (rather than actual) basis, using an assumed 38 % tax rate and
taking into account (x) any Tax decrease resulting from a Tax deduction in
respect of indemnified Damages and (y) any Tax increase resulting from the
Purchaser Indemnitees receipt of payments under this _Section 9.4_  in
respect of indemnified Losses (including any Tax increase that results
from the loss of Tax deductions by reason of a net decrease in the Final
Purchase Price, it being further understood that for this purpose any Tax
increase resulting from a decrease in the Final Purchase Price shall be
calculated on a present value basis)). For the avoidance of doubt, a Tax
increase pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding sentence shall not include
any increase in Taxes of an entity other than the entity that suffered the
Loss in respect of which indemnification is being provided and shall not
include any consequential Tax damages, it being understood that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the loss of Tax deductions described in the parenthetical
of clause (y) of the preceding sentence shall not be considered consequential
Tax damages.  If a Purchaser Indemnitee shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Sellers in respect of Losses and shall
subsequently receive insurance proceeds, net Tax benefits or other amounts
recovered under indemnification agreements or arrangements with third parties
(to the extent that such insurance proceeds, net Tax benefits or other
amounts were not previously taken into account under the first sentence of
this _Section 9.4(a)_ ) in respect of such Losses, then such Purchaser
Indemnitee shall promptly repay to the Sellers a sum equal to the amount of
such insurance proceeds, net Tax benefits or other amounts actually received
(net of applicable Taxes), provided, that if any insurance proceeds, net Tax
benefits or other amounts taken into account under the first sentence of this
_Section 9.4(a)_ or paid over to the Sellers pursuant to this sentence
are subsequently denied, disallowed or otherwise lost, then the Sellers shall
pay to the Purchaser Indemnitees additional indemnification equal to the
amount of the applicable proceeds, net Tax benefits or other amounts;

  

(b) Indemnification under this _Article 9_ shall not be available to any
Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party first uses all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain recovery from any Collateral Source for such
claim before making any claim for indemnification by the Responsible Party;
_provided_ that for purposes of tolling the Indemnity Period, the Indemnified
Party may assert such claim. In the event of any claim payable out of
the Escrow Account or by drawing on the General Credit Support, as the case
may be, the Parent may, in its sole discretion, require any Indemnified Party
to grant to Parent an assignment of the right of such Indemnified Party to
assert a claim against any Collateral Source. If the amount to be netted
hereunder from any payment required under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _9.2(b)_ is
determined after payment of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
Indemnified Party under this _Article 9_, the Indemnified Party shall repay
to the Responsible Parties, promptly after such determination,

   

36   

 

  

any amount that the Responsible Parties would not have had to pay pursuant to
this _Article 9_ had such determination been made at the time of such
payment;

  

(c) the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover for any
particular Loss pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ unless such Loss, together with
any related Losses, equals or exceeds $100,000;

  

(d) the Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant
to clause (i) of _Section 9.2(a)_ until the total amount which the Purchaser
Indemnitees would recover under clause (i) of _Section 9.2(a)_ (as limited
by the provisions of _Sections 9.4(a)_, _9.4(b)_ , _9.4(c)_ and _9.4(d)_
), exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), at which point, the
Purchaser Indemnitees become entitled to recover the entire amount of any
Losses (including Losses that were below the Threshold) pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ (as limited by the provisions of _Sections 9.4(a)_, _9.4(b)_ ,
_9.4(c)_  and _9.4(d))_ ;

  

(e) if a Purchaser Indemnitee has been indemnified for a Loss hereunder, and
at any time thereafter a Purchaser Indemnitee recovers all or a portion of
such Loss from a third Person, the Purchaser Indemnitee which made such
recovery shall promptly refund the amount paid from by the Sellers to the
Parent with respect to such Loss, less any expenses incurred in
collecting from a third party (up to the amount recovered from the third
Person); and

  

(f) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) all remaining funds in
the Escrow Account in excess of $5,450,000 shall be released from the Escrow
Account to the Sellers, and (ii) if the Sellers had previously elected to
substitute General Credit Support in lieu of funds on deposit in the Escrow
Account in accordance with _Section 3.4_ , the General Credit Support
required to be maintained by the Sellers shall be reduced to $5,450,000,
provided, however, that if any claim is then pending under _Section 9.2_ , an
additional amount sufficient to recover such claim shall be retained in the
Escrow Account or additional sufficient General Credit Support shall be
maintained until such time as such claim is finally resolved. On the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, all remaining funds in the Escrow Account
shall be transferred to the Tax Escrow Account, and (ii) if the Sellers had
previously elected to maintain General Credit Support in lieu of funds
on deposit in the Escrow Account in accordance with _Section 3.4_ , Sellers
shall procure that any undrawn amounts under such General Credit Support be
available to the Purchaser under the Tax Credit Support, provided, however,
that if any claim is then pending under _Section 9.2_ , an amount sufficient
to recover such claim shall be retained in the Escrow Account or
sufficient General Credit Support shall be maintained until such time as such
claim is finally resolved. At any time the Purchaser Indemnitees (x) will be
entitled to recover no more than the amount of cash then in the Escrow
Account or the amount of the General Credit Support then remaining and (y)
pursuant to this Agreement, will not be entitled to recover Losses from any
source other than the Escrow Account or by drawing on the General Credit
Support.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have
no rights to indemnification under _Article 9_ for Losses aggregating more
than $21,800,000, and after the first anniversary of the Closing Date for
Losses aggregating more than $5,450,000 (plus any additional amounts with
respect to any claim then pending under _Section 9.2_ until such claim is
finally resolved), provided however, that the Purchaser Indemnitees shall
have no rights to indemnification under _Article 9_  after the third
anniversary of the Closing Date (except with respect to any claim then pending
under _Section 9.2_ until such claim is finally resolved) and provided
further that this _Section 9.4(f)_ shall not apply to breaches of covenants
set forth in _Section 6.2_, breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in _Sections 4.2_,  _4.4_ , and _4.7_ or the indemnification
provisions set forth in _Section 9.6_.

     

   

9.5 _Limitations on Claims with Respect to Environmental Matters_.

  

(a) With respect to any claim by a Purchaser Indemnitee for a Loss resulting
from a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in  _Section 4.21_,
and in addition to the other limitations set forth in this _Article 9_ , the
Sellers shall only be liable to the Purchaser Indemnitees for Losses
resulting from the following:

  

(i) an investigation ( _Ma ßnahmen der Gefahrerkundung,
Untersuchungsmaßnahmen_) in connection with, or in anticipation of, the
remediation of non-compliance with Environmental Law;

  

(ii) a clean-up ( _Sanierung_ ) within the meaning of Section 2 para 7 of the
Federal Soil Protection Act or any applicable Environmental Law;

  

(iii) securing measures ( _Sicherungsma ßnahmen_) or protective containment
measures ( _Schutz- und Beschr ankungsmaßnahmen_) pursuant to Section 4 para
3 of the Federal Soil Protection Act or any applicable Environmental Law; or

  

(iv) measures to eliminate, reduce or otherwise remedy an immediate danger to
human health or well-being ( _Ma ßnahmen zur Abwehr von unmittelbaren
Gefahren fur Leib und Leben_).

  

(b) Purchaser Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover Losses resulting
from a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in _Section 4.21_
if:

  

(i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required pursuant to any
Environmental Law (or by the relevant regulatory authority) to remedy the
relevant matter by a final and binding ( _bestandskr aftig_) or an
unappealable enforceable ( _endg ultig sofort vollziehbar_) decision of a
competent authority or as a result of a public law contract between the
Company or its Subsidiary and the competent authority agreed to either prior
to the Closing Date or, with the Sellers consent, after the Closing Date, or
by a final court judgment resulting from a third party claim; or

  

(ii) prompt remediation is required pursuant to any Environmental Law due to
an imminent material danger to public health; or

  

(iii) the respective measure to remedy the relevant matter has been agreed to
by the Sellers; or

  

(c) Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses resulting
from a breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Section
4.21_, to the extent that

  

(i) the Loss could have been avoided or mitigated by Purchaser or the Company
and its Subsidiaries by taking the measures or applying the environmental,
health and safety standards that should reasonably have been taken by a
prudent businessman; provided that this exclusion shall not apply if Seller
did not take measures or apply environmental, health and safety standards
that should reasonably have been taken by a prudent businessman during the
two (2) years prior to the Closing Date.

  

(ii) the Loss is a result of (1) a shut-down, cessation of business
activities on, or the abandonment of a plant or a portion thereof, of a
building or of a facility, (2) a change of

     

   

use resulting in more stringent environmental laws, thresholds or standards
becoming applicable, (3) construction activity that directly brings about a
Loss that is not the product of the mere discovery of a latent matter, or (4)
a notification or preparatory or explanatory measures or investigation on the
property which Purchaser or the Company and its Subsidiaries were not obliged
to carry out under Law and was not requested by the competent Governmental
Body.

  

9.6 _Tax Indemnity._

  

(a) The Sellers agree to assume, defend and indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnitees (including, without limitation and for avoidance of
doubt, from and after the Closing, the Company, its Subsidiaries and
FiberMark Investments) from and against (i) any liability for Tax resulting
from a breach of the covenant in _Section 6.2(b)(xiii)_ , (ii) to the extent
not described in clause _(i)_ or _(iii)_ or _Section 10.1_ , any liability of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or FiberMark Investments for payment of Taxes
relating to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii)
any Taxes resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than those Taxes described in _Section 10.1_ ), and (iv) any liability
for Taxes resulting from the breach of clause (iii) of the first sentence of
_Section 4.11(c)_ , but only if and to the extent that the total amount of
such Taxes described in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section 9.6(a)_
exceeds the total amount of Taxes included as Liabilities in the final
determination of Final Net Working Capital (and for the avoidance of doubt,
the calculation of Net Working Capital shall not include any liabilities for
income Taxes). The indemnity shall become due within 10 (ten) Business
Days following a notice delivered by Purchaser to the Sellers that payment of
such Taxes to the respective Tax authority is due or that such Taxes have
been paid, provided, however, that no indemnity amounts shall be due: (i) in
the event an application for suspension of enforcement has been submitted,
until a decision with respect to such application finally has been made; (ii)
in the event that a suspension of enforcement is granted, until the
expiration of such suspension of enforcement; or (iii) to the extent the
Purchaser has not complied with the provisions set forth in (d) and (e) below
and such failure prejudiced the Sellers in mitigating their liability under
this _Section 9.6(a)_.

  

In the case of any liability for Taxes described in clause (i) or clause (ii)
of the first sentence of this _Section 9.6(a)_  that arise in a taxable
period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing
Date (the " _Straddle Period_ "), the allocation of such liability for Taxes
shall be apportioned between the period starting on the first day of the
Straddle Period and ending on (and including) the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Date Straddle Period_ ") and the remaining portion of the Straddle
Period. In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, and not determined
by reference to income, revenues, receipts or transactions, the amount of
such Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Date Straddle Period be determined
as follows: the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period shall be
multiplied by a fraction (x) the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the period ending on the Closing Date and (y) the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.  Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, the amount of Tax attributable to the
Pre-Closing Date Straddle Period shall be the amount of Tax to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries would be liable if the Pre-Closing Straddle
Period were a taxable period and if it were permitted to file a tax return
for the purpose of the Pre-Closing Date Straddle Period.

  

(b) It is understood that the Sellers may realize a capital gain resulting
from the sale of the FiberMark International Held Interest (the " _Capital
Gain_ "), which, if realized, will be subject to trade tax at the level of
the Company. In addition, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including without limitation by Section 3.5) may result in a trade tax.
Without limiting the Sellers obligations under _Section 9.6(a)_, the
Sellers agree to assume, defend and indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
(or in the Purchasers absolute discretion, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
from and against trade tax resulting from the Capital Gain or the
transactions described in the preceding sentence.

     

   

(c) Any Tax indemnification payment under _Section 9.6(a_ ) or _(b)_ shall be
reduced by the net present value (to be calculated using a discount rate of
6% per annum) of any net Tax benefit to the Purchaser Indemnitee that results
from the adjustment giving rise to such payment (it being understood that net
Tax benefits shall be computed using an assumed 38% Tax rate and taking into
account (x) any Tax decrease resulting from a Tax deduction resulting from
such adjustment and (y) any Tax increase resulting from an inclusion of
Taxable income, gain or profits as a result of such adjustment or resulting
from the receipt of the applicable Tax indemnification payment by the
Purchaser Indemnitee (including any Tax increase that results from a loss of
Tax deductions by reason of a net decrease in the Final Purchase Price, it
being understood for this purpose that any Tax increase resulting from a
decrease in the Final Purchase Price shall be calculated on a present value
basis)). For the avoidance of doubt, a Tax increase or decrease pursuant to
the preceding sentence shall not include any increase or decrease in Taxes of
an entity other than the applicable Purchaser Indemnitee and shall
not include any consequential Tax damages or benefits (it being understood
that Tax increases described in the parenthetical in clause (y) of the
preceding sentence shall not be considered consequential Tax damages). For
avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall not be entitled under _Section 9.6(g)_
to any refund of Taxes to the extent such refund corresponds to a Tax
decrease taken into account under this _Section 9.6(c)_ or _Section 9.4(a)_.

  

(d) The Purchaser shall procure that the Tax Returns ( _Steuererkl arungen_)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and of FiberMark Investments, including
any amendments thereto, for any period up to or including the Closing Date
will be duly prepared and filed by the Company, its Subsidiaries and
FiberMark Investments, consistent with past practice and Tax positions
previously taken by such entities, to the extent such practices and
procedures are not prohibited by applicable law, within the time limits set
forth in the applicable Tax laws or as determined by the Tax authorities.
Without limiting the foregoing, such positions shall include a deduction for
interest on the intercompany indebtedness between Parent and FiberMark
International through the Closing Date or, if earlier, the date before the
day on which such indebtedness is eliminated in accordance with _Section
3.5_. Purchaser shall provide the Sellers with drafts thereof and all
relevant documents and other information reasonably necessary for the review
of such drafts for Sellers comments no later than thirty (30) days prior to
the due date of such filing. Purchaser shall procure that such Tax
Returns shall include all reasonable modifications requested by the Sellers
in writing within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Sellers have been
provided with the draft Tax Returns.

  

(e) Purchaser shall procure that the Sellers are informed in a timely manner
of all Tax assessments ( _Steuerbescheide_ ) and announcements of Tax audits
( _Betriebspr ufungen_) which may give rise to a claim under this _Section
9.6_. Purchaser shall procure that the Sellers are provided with all relevant
documents and other information reasonably required by the Sellers to
evaluate the Tax assessments or Tax audits and the potential liability of the
Sellers in connection therewith. If and to the extent that Tax audits of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or FiberMark Investments relate to Taxes
for which the Sellers may be liable under the indemnity set forth in this
_Section 9.6_ , the Sellers shall at their request be given the opportunity
to instruct, at their own expense, counsel, accountants or auditors to
represent the Sellers in relation to such Tax audits and  to the extent
legally permissible  fully participate in such Tax audits (including
meetings with a Tax authority). In general, Purchaser shall take, and shall
procure that the Company, its Subsidiaries, and FiberMark Investments take,
such action, at the cost of the Sellers, as the Sellers may reasonably
require by written notice to Purchaser to avoid, dispute, resist, appeal or
otherwise defend against any claim for Taxes for which the Sellers may be
liable hereunder (a " _Tax Claim_ "). Purchaser shall procure that the Sellers
may take part in any such defense of a Tax Claim and that the Sellers will
be provided with all relevant documents, other information and
assistance reasonably required for the defense.  Binding declarations to a
Tax authority relating to Taxes for which the Sellers may be liable pursuant
to this _Section 9.6_ , including concessions with respect to any Tax Claim,
shall be made only upon consultation with and approval by the Sellers, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In addition,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this

     

   

 _Section 9.6(e)_ , the Sellers shall not settle or compromise a Tax Claim
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such settlement or compromise could
result in Taxes for a pre-Closing period or the Pre-Closing Date Straddle
Period for which the Sellers are not required to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees pursuant to this _Section 9.6_ or could increase Taxes of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or FiberMark Investments for any taxable
period that begins after the Closing Date, or for the post-Closing period of
any Straddle Period.

  

(f) [Intentionally omitted.]

  

(g) Except as provided in the last sentence of _Section 9.6(c)_ , the Sellers
shall be entitled to all refunds of Taxes received by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or FiberMark Investments attributable to any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including the pre-Closing Date
Straddle Period, but only if and to the extent that the total amount of such
refunds of Taxes exceeds the total amount of such refunds included as assets
in the final determination of Final Net Working Capital. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Sellers shall also be entitled to any refund or reduction of Taxes
for which the Sellers provided indemnification pursuant to this _Section
9.6_.

  

(h) Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be
entitled to recover from the Tax Escrow Account, in the amount of $24,000,000
plus any earnings, interest or profits thereon (and minus any distributions
from such account made in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) and plus any
amounts transferred to the Tax Escrow Account from the Escrow Account on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date as provided in _Section 9.4(f)_ , for
any liability for Taxes described in _Section 9.6(a)(ii),_ _(iii)_ or _(iv)_
or _Section 9.6(b)_ (" _Capped Taxes_ "), provided however, that if the
Sellers elect to maintain Tax Credit Support in accordance with _Section 3.4_
in lieu of amounts on deposit in the Tax Escrow Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover by drawing on the Tax Credit
Support, as increased on the third anniversary of the Closing Date as
provided in _Section 9.4(f)_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, (w) if (i) the Tax Escrow Account is reduced to zero or the
full amount is drawn under the Tax Credit Support and (ii) liabilities of the
Purchaser Indemnitees for Capped Taxes under _Section 9.6(a)_ remain
unsatisfied, then the Purchaser Indemnitees may recover from the General
Escrow Account or the General Credit Support provided in lieu thereof,
subject to the limitations of Section 9.4(f), (x) the Purchaser Indemnitees
will be entitled to recover in respect of Capped Taxes no more than the
amount of cash then in the Tax Escrow Account (as increased pursuant to
_Section 9.4(f)_ ) or the amount then available to be drawn under the Tax
Credit Support (as increased pursuant to _Section 9.4(f))_ , and the
additional amounts available pursuant to clause (w), (y) pursuant to this
Agreement, the Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to recover Capped
Taxes from any source other than the Tax Escrow Account, the Tax
Credit Support and the additional sources of recovery described in clause
(w), and (z) on the date that the amount of cash in the Tax Escrow Account is
reduced to zero or the Tax Credit Support provided in lieu of the Tax Escrow
Account has been fully drawn, and the additional sources of recovery
described in clause (w) have been exhausted, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall
have no further rights to indemnification for Capped Taxes. On the date
following the expiration of the last applicable statute of limitations with
respect to Capped Taxes, any amounts remaining in the Tax Escrow
Account shall be released from the Tax Escrow Account to Sellers and any Tax
Credit Support shall be released; provided, however, that if any claim is
then pending under this _Section 9.6_ in respect of Capped Taxes, sufficient
funds to recover such claim shall be retained in the Tax Escrow Account or
sufficient Tax Credit Support shall be maintained until such time as such
claim is finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover amounts
from the Tax Escrow Account in respect of Pre-Closing Ordinary Course Taxes,
but rather shall have full recourse against the Sellers for Pre-Closing
Ordinary Course Taxes.

     

   

(i) Absent a change in law, the Parties shall treat all payments made
pursuant to this Article 9 as adjustments of the Purchase Price, shall file
their Tax returns consistent with such treatment and shall defend such
position if and to the extent challenged by a Tax authority. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if there is a change in applicable law or if it is finally
determined (pursuant to a closing agreement, non-appealable decision of a
court of competent jurisdiction, or other legally binding determination) that
a Purchaser Indemnitee or its Affiliates is subject to Tax in respect of the
receipt or accrual of an indemnity payment, then the amount of such payment
shall be increased so that the Purchaser Indemnitee receives, after Tax, the
amount of indemnification to which it is entitled (determined without regard
to this sentence).

  

9.7 Exclusive Remedy.  Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, (i) indemnification pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article 9_ shall be the exclusive remedy for
the Parties for any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or
other provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto, (ii) except for recourse against the Sellers as otherwise
provided in _Sections 9.4(f)_ and _9.6_ , no Purchaser Indemnitee shall
have any recourse against the Sellers or any director, officer, equity owner
or Affiliate of the Sellers with respect to any matter that is subject
to indemnification pursuant to _Article 9_, and (iii) except for recourse
against the Sellers as otherwise provided in _Sections 9.4(f)_  and _9.6_ ,
making a claim for a proper distribution from the Escrow Account or the Tax
Escrow Account, as the case may be, or drawing on the General Credit Support
or the Tax Credit Support, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available
to the Purchaser Indemnitees to recover any Loss, Losses or other amounts
(including, without limitation, any claims relating to environmental matters
or Tax matters other than those described in _Sections 9.4(f)_ and _9.6_ )
suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

The provisions of this _Article 9_ were specifically bargained for and
reflected in the amounts payable to the Sellers pursuant to _Article 2_.

  

9.8 _Payment Currency_. Any amounts Payable under this _Article 9_ shall be
payable in U.S. dollars. Any payment amounts made in Euro shall be converted
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate as quoted in the Wall Street Journal
on such date as the Indemnified Party makes a claim to the Responsible Party.

  

ARTICLE 10

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

10.1 _Payment of Sales, Use or Similar Taxes_.  All sales, use, transfer,
intangible, recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of
any nature whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any German transfer or similar
taxes incurred by the Company resulting from the transfer of the Company
Interests) shall be borne by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Sellers shall be responsible for trade tax, as described in _Section 9.6(b)_.

  

Sellers shall not opt for VAT under Section 9 of the German Value Added Tax
Act.

  

10.2 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereunder are
consummated, each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall bear its own
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

     

   

10.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_.  This Agreement (including
the schedules and exhibits hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to
this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party,
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver
of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure
on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy.

  

10.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of
or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York. Any action against any party relating to
the foregoing shall be brought in any federal or state court of
competent jurisdiction located within the State of New York, and the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court located within the State of New York over any such
action. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such action.

  

10.5 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally
by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when sent by facsimile
(with written confirmation of transmission) or (iii) one Business Day
following the day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of
receipt), in each case at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or
to such other address or facsimile number as a party may have specified by
notice given to the other party pursuant to this provision):

10.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement

     

   

shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

10.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person not a party to this
Agreement. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made by the Purchaser, directly or indirectly (by operation
of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be
void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) on or after the Closing Date,
Purchaser may, without consent, collaterally assign this Agreement or any of
its rights under this Agreement to any of its lenders in connection with any
debt financing and (b) at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
may assign any of its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to
one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries. No assignment of any obligations
hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations; provided
that upon any assignment described in clause (b) of the preceding sentence,
the Purchaser shall be released from the obligation under Section 4.21(g) and
such obligation shall be assumed by the assignee or assignees of the
Purchaser. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such assignee unless the
context otherwise requires.

  

10.8 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named
as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such party. Except to the extent a named party
to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such named party in this Agreement and not otherwise), no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any party
hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

10.9 _Counterparts_ This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

10.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to
any other remedies at Law or in equity.

  

 _** REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK **_

     

   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the
date first written above.
