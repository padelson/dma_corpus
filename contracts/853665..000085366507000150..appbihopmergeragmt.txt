                                  ARTICLE III

                Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the
                    Constituent Corporations; Exchange Fund;
                              Company Equity Awards

     SECTION 3.01.  Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the  Merger  and  without  any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

     (a)  Capital  Stock of Sub.  Each share of capital  stock of Sub issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable  share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

     (b)  Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned  Stock.  Each share of
Company  Common  Stock  that is held  by the  Company,  as  treasury  stock,  or
otherwise  owned by Parent,  Sub or any  subsidiary  of the Company  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall  automatically  be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

     (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock.  Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and  outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time or  issuable
pursuant to any outstanding options,  warrants or other rights (including shares
of Company  Restricted  Stock, but excluding shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 3.01(b) and, except as provided in Section  3.01(d),  the Appraisal
Shares)  shall be converted  into the right to receive  $25.50 in cash,  without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically  be
canceled  and  shall  cease to exist,  and each  holder  of a  certificate  that
immediately  prior to the Effective Time  represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

     (d) Appraisal  Rights.  Notwithstanding  anything in this  Agreement to the
contrary,  shares (the  "Appraisal  Shares") of Company  Common Stock issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects  with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section  3.01(c),  but instead such holder shall be
entitled  to  payment of the fair value of such  shares in  accordance  with the
provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal  Shares shall no
longer be  outstanding  and shall  automatically  be canceled and shall cease to
exist,  and each holder of Appraisal  Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect  thereto,  except the right to receive  the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose

<PAGE>

                                                                               9

the right to appraisal  under  Section 262 or a court of competent  jurisdiction
shall  determine  that such  holder is not  entitled  to the relief  provided by
Section  262,  then the right of such  holder to be paid the fair  value of such
holder's  Appraisal  Shares  under  Section 262 shall  cease and such  Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been  converted at the Effective  Time into,  and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger  Consideration as provided in
Section  3.01(c).  The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands
and any other  instruments  served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company,
and Parent shall have the right to  participate  in and direct all  negotiations
and proceedings  with respect to such demands.  Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,  or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

     SECTION 3.02.  Exchange Fund. (a) Paying Agent.  Prior to the Closing Date,
Parent  shall  appoint  a bank or trust  company  reasonably  acceptable  to the
Company  to act as paying  agent (the  "Paying  Agent")  for the  payment of the
Merger  Consideration,  the Option/SAR Amounts and the RSU Amounts in accordance
with  this  Article  III and,  in  connection  therewith,  shall  enter  into an
agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably  acceptable to the Company.
At or prior to the  Effective  Time,  Parent shall  deposit,  or shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation  to  deposit,  with the Paying  Agent,  cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger  Consideration,  the aggregate Option/SAR
Amount and the RSU Amount,  in each case as required to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

     (b) Certificate Exchange  Procedures.  As promptly as practicable after the
Effective  Time,  but in any event within two business days  thereafter,  Parent
shall cause the Paying  Agent to mail to each holder of record of a  Certificate
(i) a  letter  of  transmittal  (which  shall  specify  that  delivery  shall be
effected,  and risk of loss and title to the Certificates  shall pass, only upon
proper  delivery  of the  Certificates  to the  Paying  Agent  and  which  shall
otherwise be in customary form) and (ii)  instructions  for use in effecting the
surrender of the  Certificates  in exchange for the Merger  Consideration.  Each
holder of record of a Certificate  shall,  upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
such Certificate,  together with such letter of transmittal,  duly executed, and
such other  documents  as may  reasonably  be required by the Paying  Agent,  be
entitled to receive in exchange  therefor the amount of cash which the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously  represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section  3.01(c),  and
the Certificate so surrendered  shall  forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company  Common  Stock which is not  registered  in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the  Certificate  so surrendered
is registered if such Certificate  shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person  requesting  such payment  shall pay any
fiduciary  or surety bonds or any transfer or other  similar  taxes  required by
reason of the  payment of the Merger  Consideration  to a person  other than the
registered   holder  of  such   Certificate   or  establish  to  the  reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not  applicable.  Until

<PAGE>

                                                                              10

surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b),  each Certificate  shall be
deemed  at any time  after the  Effective  Time to  represent  only the right to
receive upon such  surrender the Merger  Consideration  which the holder thereof
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article
III. No interest  shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.

     (c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon
the surrender of  Certificates  in accordance with the terms of this Article III
shall be deemed to have been paid in full  satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates.
At the close of  business on the day on which the  Effective  Time  occurs,  the
stock  transfer  books of the  Company  shall be closed,  and there  shall be no
further  registration  of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation  of the  shares  of  Company  Common  Stock  that  were  outstanding
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time.  If, after the Effective  Time,  any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving  Corporation for transfer, it shall be
canceled  against  delivery  of cash to the holder  thereof as  provided in this
Article III.

     (d) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains  undistributed  to the holders of the Certificates for nine months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates  who have not theretofore  complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,  payment
of their claims for the Merger Consideration  pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III.

     (e)  No  Liability.  None  of  Parent,  Sub,  the  Company,  the  Surviving
Corporation  or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
cash from the Exchange Fund  delivered to a public  official in compliance  with
any applicable state,  Federal or other abandoned  property,  escheat or similar
Law. If any  Certificate  shall not have been  surrendered  prior to the date on
which the related Merger  Consideration  would escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental  Entity, any such Merger  Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law,  immediately prior to such time become the property
of Parent,  free and clear of all claims or  interest  of any person  previously
entitled thereto.

     (f)  Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the  Exchange  Fund  as  directed  by  Parent;  provided,   however,  that  such
investments  shall be in  obligations  of or  guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or  instrumentality  thereof  and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United  States of America,  in  commercial  paper  obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc.  or  Standard &
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker's  acceptances of commercial  banks with capital  exceeding
$1.0 billion  (based on the most recent  financial  statements of such bank that
are then publicly available).  Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments  shall be paid  solely to Parent.  Nothing  contained  herein and no
investment  losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish

                                                                              11

the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger  Consideration or
any holder of a Company  Stock  Option or Company SAR to receive the  Option/SAR
Amount or any holder of a Company RSU to receive the RSU Amount, in each case as
provided herein.

     (g) Lost  Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person  claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond or surety in such  reasonable  amount as Parent
may  direct as  indemnity  against  any claim  that may be made  against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed  Certificate the applicable Merger  Consideration with
respect thereto.

     (h) Withholding  Rights.  Parent,  the Surviving  Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration  otherwise
payable  pursuant to this  Agreement  to any holder of shares of Company  Common
Stock or any holder of a Company Stock  Option,  Company SAR or Company RSU such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to
deduct  and  withhold  with  respect  to the  making of such  payment  under the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended (the  "Code"),  or any  provision of
state,  local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid  over  to  the  appropriate  taxing  authority  by  Parent,  the  Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent,  such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes  of this  Agreement  as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company  Common Stock or the holder of the Company Stock Option,  Company SAR or
Company  RSU,  as the case  may be,  in  respect  of which  such  deduction  and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

     SECTION 3.03. Company Equity Awards. (a) As soon as reasonably  practicable
following the date of this  Agreement the Board of Directors of the Company (or,
if appropriate,  any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt
such  resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that,
at  the  Effective  Time,  each  unexercised   Company  Stock  Option  and  each
unexercised  Company  SAR,  whether  vested or  unvested  and whether or not any
applicable  performance  conditions  have been  satisfied,  in each case that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled, with the
holder of each such Company  Stock  Option or Company SAR  becoming  entitled to
receive an amount in cash  equal to (i) the  excess,  if any,  of (A) the Merger
Consideration  over (B) the  exercise  price per share of Company  Common  Stock
subject to such  Company  Stock Option or Company  SAR,  multiplied  by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or
Company SAR (such amount, the "Option/SAR Amount"). All amounts payable pursuant
to this Section  3.03(a) shall be paid as promptly as practicable  following the
Effective Time, without interest.

     (b) As soon as reasonably  practicable following the date of this Agreement
the Board of  Directors  of the  Company  (or,  if  appropriate,  any  committee
administering  any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other actions as may be required to provide that,  at the Effective  Time,  each
Company RSU that is  outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall
vest in full and  shall be  converted  into the  right  to  receive  the  Merger
Consideration  in  accordance  with  Section  3.01(c)  (such  amount,  the  "RSU
Amount").

     (c) With respect to the ESPPs, each share of Company Common Stock purchased
thereunder  shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive  the Merger  Consideration  pursuant to Section  3.01(c).  As soon as
reasonably  practicable following the date of this Agreement,  the Company shall
take any and all actions with  respect to the ESPPs as are  necessary to provide
that (i)  participants  may not increase their payroll  deductions from those in
effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no offerings shall be commenced after
the date of this  Agreement  and (iii) the  offerings  that are in effect on the
date of this  Agreement  (the  "Current  Offering  Periods")  shall  continue in
accordance  with the  applicable  terms of the ESPPs,  and each share of Company
Common Stock purchased by a participant on the last day of either ESPP's Current
Offering  Period (each,  an "Offering  Period Last Day") shall be converted into
the right to  receive  the  Merger  Consideration  in  accordance  with  Section
3.01(c);  provided that,  notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if the Closing occurs
prior  to an  ESPP's  Offering  Period  Last  Day,  each  participant's  payroll
deductions  accumulated as of the Effective Time for the Current Offering Period
of such ESPP  shall be applied to the  purchase  of a number of whole  shares of
Company Common Stock, at a purchase price determined as if the Closing Date were
such ESPP's  Offering  Period Last Day, which number of shares shall be canceled
and converted into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration  in accordance
with  Section  3.01(c).  Each ESPP shall  terminate  immediately  following  the
earlier  of its  Offering  Period  Last  Day  or the  Closing  Date  (the  "ESPP
Termination Date"). Any excess payroll deductions not used to purchase shares or
determine  payment amounts  pursuant to this Section 3.03(c) as a result of ESPP
share  limitations or fractional share  limitations  shall be distributed to the
applicable participant  immediately following the ESPP Termination Date, without
interest.

                         Representations and Warranties

     SECTION 4.01.  Representations  and  Warranties  of the Company.  Except as
disclosed in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed with,
or  furnished  to, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC") by the
Company  and   publicly   available   prior  to  the  date  of  this   Agreement
(collectively,  the  "Filed  SEC  Documents")  or as set  forth  in the  Company
Disclosure  Letter (it being  understood  that any  information set forth in one
section or subsection of the Company  Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply
to and  qualify  the  Section  or  subsection  of this  Agreement  to  which  it
corresponds  in number and each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to
the extent that it is reasonably  apparent that such  information is relevant to
such other Section or subsection,  the Company represents and warrants to Parent
and Sub as follows:
<PAGE>

                                                                              13

     (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  is duly  organized  and  validly  existing  under  the Laws of its
jurisdiction  of  organization  and  has all  requisite  corporate,  company  or
partnership power and authority to carry on its business as currently conducted.
Each of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  is duly  qualified  or licensed to do
business  and is in good  standing  (where  such  concept  is  recognized  under
applicable  Law) in each  jurisdiction  where the nature of its  business or the
ownership,  leasing or operation of its properties  makes such  qualification or
licensing necessary,  other than where the failure to be so qualified,  licensed
or in good standing,  individually or in the aggregate, has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect.  The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement a true and complete
copy of the Company  Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws and the
comparable organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as
in effect on the date of this Agreement.

     (b)  Subsidiaries.  Section 4.01(b) of the Company  Disclosure Letter lists
each Subsidiary of the Company and the jurisdiction of organization thereof. All
outstanding  shares of capital  stock of, or other  equity  interests  in,  each
Subsidiary  of the  Company are owned by the  Company or any  Subsidiary  of the
Company and have been (to the extent such  concepts are relevant with respect to
such ownership  interests)  validly issued and are fully paid and  nonassessable
and are owned,  directly or  indirectly,  by the  Company  free and clear of all
pledges,  liens, charges,  mortgages,  encumbrances or security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever  (collectively,  "Liens"), other than Permitted Liens.
Except for its interests in its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly
or  indirectly,  any  capital  stock  of,  or other  equity  interests  in,  any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.

consists of 125,000,000  shares of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000  shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Preferred  Stock").  At
the close of business on July 11,  2007,  (A) (1)  74,946,095  shares of Company

after July 11, 2007 in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Company
Restricted  Stock")) and (2) 33,557,148  shares of Company Common Stock are held

11, 2007 in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Company RSUs") (4)
no shares of Company Common Stock were subject to  outstanding  rights under the
ESPPs  (assuming that the closing price for the Company Common Stock as reported
on the NASDAQ  Stock  Market on the last day of the  offering  periods in effect
under the ESPPs on July 11, 2007 was equal to the Merger  Consideration) and (C)
no shares of Company  Preferred  Stock were issued or outstanding or held by the
Company in its treasury.  Except as set forth above, at the close of business on
July 11,  2007,  no shares of capital  stock or other voting  securities  of the
Company were issued,  reserved for issuance or outstanding.  Since July 11, 2007
to the date of this  Agreement,  (x) there have been no issuances by the Company
of shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company, other than
issuances  of shares of Company  Common  Stock  pursuant to the  exercise of the
Company  Stock  Options or Company SARs or rights under the ESPPs,  in each case
outstanding  as of July 11,  2007,  and (y) there have been no  issuances by the
Company of options, warrants, other rights to acquire shares of capital stock of
the Company or other rights that give the holder  thereof any economic  interest
of a nature  accruing to the holders of Company Common Stock,  except for rights
under the ESPPs.  All  outstanding  shares of Company  Common Stock are, and all
such shares that may be issued prior to the Effective  Time will be when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
preemptive rights. There are no bonds,  debentures,  notes or other indebtedness
of the Company having the right to vote (or  convertible  into, or  exchangeable
for,  securities  having the right to vote) on any  matters on which  holders of
Company  Common  Stock  may  vote  ("Voting  Company  Debt").   Except  for  any
obligations  pursuant to this  Agreement or as otherwise set forth above,  as of
July  11,  2007,  there  are  no  options,   warrants,  rights,  convertible  or
exchangeable   securities,   stock-based   performance   units,   Contracts   or
undertakings  of any kind to which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  is a
party or by which any of them is bound (1)  obligating  the  Company or any such
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,  delivered or sold,
additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests in, or any security
convertible or  exchangeable  for any capital stock of or other equity  interest
in, the Company or of any of its  Subsidiaries  or any Voting  Company Debt, (2)
obligating the Company or any such Subsidiary to issue,  grant or enter into any
such option, warrant, right, security, unit, Contract or undertaking or (3) that
give any person the right to receive any economic  interest of a nature accruing

          (iv)  None  of the  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement,  the
     obtaining of the Stockholder  Approval or the consummation of the Merger or
     any  other  transaction   contemplated  by  this  Agreement  (alone  or  in
     conjunction  with any other event,  including any termination of employment

     director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
     of its  Subsidiaries to any  compensation  or benefits,  (B) accelerate the

     sections  4001(a)(3)  and 3(37) of ERISA that covers one or more  employees
     (each  a  "Multiemployer   Plan").   None  of  the  Company,   any  of  its
     Subsidiaries, or any Commonly Controlled Entity has, at any time, withdrawn
     from  a  Multiemployer  Plan  in a  "complete  withdrawal"  or  a  "partial
     withdrawal" as defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, respectively, so
     as to result in a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  All
     contributions  required to be made by the Company,  any of its Subsidiaries
     or any Commonly  Controlled Entity to each  Multiemployer Plan on behalf of
     one or more  current  or  former  employees  have been made when due in all

     a  "nonqualified  deferred  compensation  plan" (as defined in Code Section
     409A(d)(1)) subject to Code Section 409A has been operated since January 1,
     2005 in good faith  compliance  with Code Section 409A, the regulations and
     guidance promulgated thereunder.

          (viii) No Company Benefit Plan provides  benefits,  including  without
     limitation death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect
     to current or former  employees of the  Company,  its  Subsidiaries  or any
     Commonly Controlled Entity after retirement or other termination of service
     (other than (A) coverage mandated by applicable Laws, (B) death benefits or

     defined  in  Section  3(2) of ERISA,  (C)  deferred  compensation  benefits
     accrued as liabilities on the books of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
     or a Commonly  Controlled  Entity,  or (D) benefits the full direct cost of

     any Company  Benefit Plan or otherwise  involving any such Company  Benefit
     Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

     (m) Taxes.  (i) Each of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  has filed or has
caused to be filed  all  material  tax  returns  required  to be filed by it (or

and all such returns are complete and accurate in all material respects. Each of
the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  has  either  paid or  caused to be paid all
material  taxes  due  and  owing  by the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries  to any
Governmental  Entity, or the most recent financial  statements  contained in the
Filed SEC  Documents  reflect an adequate  reserve  (excluding  any reserves for
deferred  taxes),  if such a reserve is required by GAAP, for all material taxes
payable  by the  Company  and its  Subsidiaries,  for all  taxable  periods  and
portions thereof ending on or before the date of such financial statements.

          (ii) No deficiencies, audit examinations,  refund litigation, proposed
     adjustments  or matters in  controversy  for any material taxes (other than
     taxes that are not yet due and payable or for amounts  being  contested  in
     good faith) have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing against the
     Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  which have not been  settled and paid.
     All  assessments  for material taxes due and owing by the Company or any of
     its  Subsidiaries  with respect to completed  and settled  examinations  or
     concluded  litigation  have  been  paid.  There is no  currently  effective
     agreement  or other  document  with  respect  to the  Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries  extending  the  period of  assessment  or  collection  of any
     material taxes.

     either a  "distributing  corporation"  or a "controlled  corporation"  in a
     distribution of stock  qualifying for tax-free  treatment under Section 355
     of the Code (A) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (B)
     which  could  otherwise  constitute  part of a "plan" or "series of related
     transactions"  (within  the  meaning  of  Section  355(e)  of the  Code) in
     conjunction with the Merger.

     the  "Franchise  Agreements")  that  are  effective  as of the date of this
     Agreement to which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries is a party or by
     which the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or its or their properties is
     bound (other than any such agreements between a person and its Subsidiaries
     or  among  its  Subsidiaries)  and  which  grant or  purport  to grant to a
     Franchisee  the right to operate or license others to operate or to develop
     within a  specific  geographic  area or at a specific  location  any of the
     following  (each  a  "Franchise"):  "Applebee's  Neighborhood  Grill & Bar"
     restaurants,  "Applebee's  Grill  & Bar"  restaurants,  "Applebee's  Grill"

     restaurants,  "T.J. Applebee's Rx for Edibles & Elixirs"  restaurants,  and
     "T.J.  Applebee's  Edibles  &  Elixirs"  restaurants  (each  a  "Franchised

     enforceability,  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency  and  other  Laws  of  general
     applicability  relating to or  affecting  creditors'  rights and to general
     equity principles. All Franchise Agreements comply in all material respects
     with all applicable Laws. The execution and delivery by the Company of this
     Agreement  do not,  and  the  consummation  of the  Merger  and  the  other
     transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  and  compliance  with  the
     provisions  of this  Agreement  will not,  conflict  with, or result in any
     violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
     under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
     of any  obligation  or to the loss of a  benefit  under,  or  result in the
     creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
     any of its  Subsidiaries  under  (other than any such Lien created from any
     action taken by Parent or Sub) or any right of rescission or set-off under,
     any provision of any  Franchise  Agreement  other than any such  conflicts,
     violations,  defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would not, individually
     or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be expected  to have a Material  Adverse
     Effect. Except by operation of Law, no Franchise Agreement expressly grants
     any  Franchisee  any right of rescission or set-off;  and no Franchisee has
     asserted in writing any such right of  rescission  or set-off.  There is no
     default  under  any  Franchise  Agreement  by  the  Company  or  any of its
     Subsidiaries  or, to the  Knowledge  of the  Company,  by any  other  party
     thereto,  and no event  has  occurred  that  with the  lapse of time or the
     giving of notice  or both  would  constitute  a default  thereunder  by the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company,  by
     any other party  thereto,  in each case except as,  individually  or in the
     aggregate,  has not had or  would  not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a
     Material Adverse Effect.

     (together,  "Earnings Claim(s)"), and no Earnings Claim has been made since
     March  31,  2002  to  any  prospective  Franchisee  in  any  United  States
     Jurisdiction;  or (ii) to prospective  franchisees in any non-United States

     Subsidiaries  or Affiliates  receives  Rebates as a result of  transactions
     between the Franchisees and suppliers  selling  products or services to the
     Franchisees. When the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates buys
     products,  goods and services from a supplier,  such  supplier  charges the
     Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for these items on the same basis
     as the supplier charges a Franchisee  operating a Franchised  Restaurant in
     the United States for similar  products,  goods and services  purchased for
     use in connection with such Franchised Restaurant.  No Contract pursuant to
     which the Company or its  Subsidiaries  or Affiliates  receives a Rebate is

     with the UFOC  Guidelines in the relevant  UFOC, if applicable or (iii) not

     with any Registration Laws or Relationship  Laws, or any similar Law of any
     other jurisdiction, foreign or domestic.

          (x) The Franchise Agreements grant exclusive  development  territories

and Sub, and no other corporate proceedings (including no shareholder action) on
the part of  Parent or Sub are  necessary  to  authorize  this  Agreement  or to

Agreement  has been duly  executed and  delivered by each of Parent and Sub and,
assuming  the  due  authorization,   execution  and  delivery  by  the  Company,
constitutes  a legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of each of Parent and Sub,
enforceable  against  each of  Parent  and Sub in  accordance  with  its  terms,
subject,  as to  enforceability,  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency  and other Laws of
general applicability  relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
equity principles.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation  of the  Merger  and the other  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  and  compliance  with the  provisions  of this  Agreement  will not,
conflict  with,  or result in any  violation  or breach of, or default  (with or
without  notice  or lapse of time,  or both)  under,  or give rise to a right of
termination,  cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a
benefit under,  or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties
or assets of  Parent or Sub  under,  any  provision  of (i) the  certificate  of
incorporation  or bylaws of Parent or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of Sub or (ii)  subject to the  filings  and other  matters  referred  to in the
immediately  following  sentence,  (A) any  Contract to which Parent or Sub is a
party or by which any of their respective  properties or assets are bound or (B)
any  Law or  Judgment,  in  each  case  applicable  to  Parent  or Sub or  their
respective  properties or assets,  other than,  in the case of clause (ii),  any
such conflicts,  violations,  breaches,  defaults,  rights, losses or Liens that

Parent Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order or authorization of,
registration,  declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity
is  required  to be  obtained  or made by or with  respect  to  Parent or Sub in
connection  with the execution and delivery of this  Agreement by Parent and Sub
or the  consummation  by Parent and Sub of the Merger or the other  transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  except  for (I) the  filing  of a  premerger
notification and report form by Parent and Sub under the HSR Act and the filings
and receipt,  termination or expiration,  as applicable, of such other approvals
or waiting  periods as may be required under any other  applicable  competition,
merger control,  antitrust or similar Law, (II) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and (III) such other
consents,  approvals,  orders,  authorizations,   registrations,   declarations,
filings  and  notices  the  failure of which to be  obtained  or made would not,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected  to have a  Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

     (c)  Information  Supplied.  None  of  the  information  supplied  or to be
supplied by Parent or Sub for  inclusion  or  incorporation  by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the  stockholders of the
Company  and at the  time  of the  Stockholders'  Meeting,  contain  any  untrue
statement of a material  fact or omit to state any material  fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

     (d) Available Funds. The financing of the transactions  contemplated hereby
will consist of a combination of equity financing (the "Equity Financing") to be
funded at Closing and debt financing (the "Debt  Financing"  and,  together with
the Equity Financing, the "Financing"). The Debt Financing includes a commitment
from a financial  institution  with  respect to bridge  financing  (the  "Bridge
Financing") and a commitment from a syndicate of bond insurers to provide surety
policies  for asset  backed  securities  issued in  respect  of a whole  company
securitization  financing (the "Securitization") that will either be in place at
Closing or be used to refinance  the Bridge  Financing  after  Closing (it being
understood and agreed that for purposes hereof the "transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement"  and phrases of similar  import  shall be deemed to include the
Equity  Financing and Bridge Financing but not the  Securitization).  Parent has
delivered to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements  pursuant to
which the parties  thereto  have  committed  to provide  Parent and Sub with the
Financing  (such  agreements,  as  modified  pursuant  to Section  6.09(a),  the
"Financing  Commitments").  Each of the  Financing  Commitments,  in the form so
delivered,  is in full  force  and  effect  and is a legal,  valid  and  binding
obligation of each of Parent and Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent,  the other
parties thereto. The Financing  Commitments have not been amended,  supplemented
or otherwise modified in any respect,  except, in each case, in a manner that is
in compliance with Section  6.09(a),  and the financing  commitments  thereunder
have not been  withdrawn or  terminated.  As of the date of this  Agreement,  no
event has occurred that,  with or without notice,  lapse of time or both,  would
constitute  a  default  or breach on the part of Parent or Sub under any term or
condition of the Financing  Commitments,  and, to the  Knowledge of Parent,  (i)

                                                                              39

Parent  and Sub  will be able  to  satisfy  on a  timely  basis  all  terms  and
conditions of closing to be satisfied by them or their  Affiliates  set forth in
the Financing  Commitments,  and (ii) the Financing to be made  thereunder  will
otherwise be available  to Parent and Sub on a timely  basis to  consummate  the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Financing Commitments.  As
of the  date of this  Agreement,  Parent  and Sub  have  fully  paid any and all
commitment  fees or other fees required by the Financing  Commitments to be paid
by them on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The Financing, when funded in
accordance  with the  Financing  Commitments,  will provide  Parent and Sub with
funds  sufficient  to satisfy all of Parent's and Sub's  obligations  under this
Agreement,  including the payment of the Merger  Consideration,  the  Option/SAR
Amounts, the RSU Amounts and all associated costs and expenses.  The obligations
to make the  Financing  available to Parent and Sub pursuant to the terms of the
Financing  Commitments  are  not  subject  to  any  conditions  other  than  the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments. No vote of any holders of the
capital  stock of Parent is required  under any Law or the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange to consummate the Equity  Financing on the terms set forth in the
Financing  Commitments  or to otherwise  approve the  transactions  contemplated
hereby.

     (e)  Operations  and  Assets of Sub.  Sub has been  formed  solely  for the
purpose of engaging in the  transactions  contemplated  hereby and, prior to the
Effective Time, will not have incurred liabilities or obligations of any nature,
other than pursuant to or in connection  with this  Agreement and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent owns, beneficially
and of record,  all of the outstanding  shares of capital stock of Sub, free and
clear of all Liens.

     (f) Ownership of Company Common Stock.  Neither Parent nor Sub beneficially
own  (within  the  meaning of Section 13 of the  Exchange  Act and the rules and
regulations  promulgated  thereunder),   or  will  prior  to  the  Closing  Date
beneficially  own, any shares of Company  Common Stock,  or is a party,  or will
prior to the  Closing  Date  become a party,  to any  Contract,  arrangement  or
understanding (other than this Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting or disposing of any shares of Company Common Stock.

     (g) Brokers and Other Advisors.  No broker,  investment  banker,  financial
advisor or other person,  other than Greenhill & Co., LLC, the fees and expenses
of which  will be paid by Parent,  is  entitled  to any  broker's,  finder's  or
financial  advisor's fee or  commission  in  connection  with the Merger and the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement based upon  arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Sub.

     (h) No Other Representations or Warranties.  Except for the representations
and  warranties  contained in this Section 4.02, the Company  acknowledges  that
none of  Parent,  Sub or any  other  person on behalf of Parent or Sub makes any
other  express or implied  representation  or warranty with respect to Parent or
Sub or  with  respect  to any  other  information  provided  to the  Company  in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

indirectly,  20% or more of any class of equity  securities of the Company or of
the surviving  entity in a merger or the resulting  direct or indirect parent of
the Company or such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the transactions

consummated  would  result  in a person  or group  (or the  shareholders  of any
person) owning,  directly or indirectly,  (a) 50% or more of any class of equity
securities  of the  Company  or of  the  surviving  entity  in a  merger  or the
resulting  direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving  entity or
(b) 50% or more (based on the fair market value  thereof,  as  determined by the
Board  of  Directors  of the  Company)  of the  assets  of the  Company  and its
Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,  which the Board of  Directors  of the  Company
determines  would be more  favorable to the  stockholders  of the Company from a
financial point of view than the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement (x) after consultation with its independent  financial advisor
(who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (y) after taking
into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set
forth therein,  and (z) after taking into account all  appropriate  legal (after
consultation with its outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms
of any such  proposal) or other  aspects of such  proposal,  including,  without
limitation the identity of the third party making such proposal and the terms of
any  written  proposal  by Parent to amend or modify the terms of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall directly or indirectly  (i)(A)  withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent),  or  publicly  propose to  withdraw  (or modify in a manner  adverse to
Parent),  the approval,  recommendation  or declaration of  advisability by such
Board of Directors or any such  committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (B)
recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly  propose
to recommend,  approve or adopt, any Takeover  Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii)
approve or recommend,  or publicly propose to approve or recommend,  or cause or
permit the  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  to execute or enter  into,  any
letter of intent,  memorandum of understanding,  agreement in principle,  merger
agreement,  acquisition  agreement  or other  similar  agreement  related to any
Takeover  Proposal,  other than any  confidentiality  agreement  referred  to in
Section  5.02(a).  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or  anything  else  in  this
Agreement  to the  contrary,  at any time  prior to  obtaining  the  Stockholder
Approval and subject to compliance with Section 6.06(b), if the Company receives
a Takeover  Proposal  which the Board of Directors  of the Company  concludes in
good  faith  constitutes  a Superior  Proposal,  the Board of  Directors  of the

                                                                              46

Company may, if it determines (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to take such action  would be  inconsistent  with its  fiduciary  duties
under applicable Law, (1) make an Adverse  Recommendation Change or (2) cause or
permit the Company to terminate  this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the
Board of  Directors  of the  Company  shall not make an  Adverse  Recommendation
Change,  and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (2)
above, until after the second business day following Parent's receipt of written
notice (a "Notice of Superior  Proposal") from the Company  advising Parent that
the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying
the  reasons  therefor,  including  the  material  terms and  conditions  of any
Superior  Proposal  that is the basis of the  proposed  action by such  Board of
Directors and the identity of the person  submitting such Superior  Proposal (it
being  understood  and agreed that (I) any amendment to the  financial  terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
two  business  day  period  and (II) in  determining  whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation  Change or to cause or permit the  Company to so  terminate  this
Agreement,  the Board of  Directors  of the Company  shall take into account any
changes  to the  financial  terms of this  Agreement  proposed  by Parent to the
Company in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise).

     (c) In  addition  to the  obligations  of the Company set forth in Sections
5.02(a) and 5.02(b),  the Company shall as promptly as practicable advise Parent
orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover  Proposal after the date of
this Agreement,  the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal
and the identity of the person  making any such Takeover  Proposal.  The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material  developments with respect
to any such Takeover Proposal (including any material changes thereto).

     (d) Nothing  contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this  Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its  stockholders a
position  contemplated  by Rule  14d-9 or Rule  14e-2(a)  promulgated  under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its  stockholders  if the Board of
Directors of the Company  determines  (after  consultation with outside counsel)
that  failure to do so would be  inconsistent  with its  fiduciary  duties under
applicable  Law;  provided,  any such  disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or
(ii) (other than a "stop,  look and listen" letter or similar  communication  of
the type  contemplated  by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be an Adverse  Recommendation  Change  unless the Board of  Directors  of the
Company expressly reaffirms in such disclosure the Recommendation.

     SECTION 5.03.  WARN Act. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries  not to,  effectuate (1) a "plant  closing" (as defined in the WARN
Act)  affecting  any single  site of  employment  or one or more  facilities  or
operating  units within any single site of  employment  of the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries;  or (2) a "mass  layoff"  (as defined in the WARN Act) at any
single site of  employment or one or more  facilities or operating  units within
any single site of employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries  shall  otherwise  terminate or lay off
employees  in the  United  States in such  numbers  as to give rise to  material
liability to the Company under any  applicable  Laws  respecting  the payment of
severance  pay,  separation  pay,  termination  pay,  pay in lieu of  notice  of
termination,  redundancy pay, or the payment of any other compensation,  premium
or penalty upon  termination of employment,  reduction of hours, or temporary or
permanent  layoffs.  For  purposes  of the  WARN  Act and  this  Agreement,  the
Effective  Time is and  shall be the same as the  "effective  date"  within  the
meaning of the WARN Act.

                              Additional Agreements

     SECTION 6.01.  Preparation of the Proxy Statement;  Stockholders'  Meeting.
(a) As promptly as reasonably  practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company  shall prepare (in  consultation  with Parent) and file with the SEC
the Proxy  Statement.  Parent  shall  provide  to the  Company  all  information
concerning  Parent  and Sub as may be  reasonably  requested  by the  Company in
connection  with the Proxy  Statement and shall  otherwise  assist and cooperate
with the Company in the  preparation  of the Proxy  Statement and  resolution of
comments  referred to below.  The Company shall promptly  notify Parent upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from
the SEC or the  staff of the SEC for  amendments  or  supplements  to the  Proxy
Statement,  and shall provide Parent with copies of all  correspondence  between
the Company and its  Representatives,  on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff
of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy  Statement and to cause the Proxy Statement to
be  mailed  to the  stockholders  of  the  Company  as  promptly  as  reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy  Statement (or any  amendment or supplement  thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with  respect  thereto,  the Company
shall provide Parent a reasonable  opportunity to review and to propose comments
on such document or response.

     (b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably  practicable following the
date of this Agreement,  establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Stockholders' Meeting") for
the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder Approval. Subject to the ability of the
Board of  Directors  of the  Company  to make an Adverse  Recommendation  Change
pursuant to Section 5.02(b),  the Company shall,  through its Board of Directors
include the  Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.  Subject to Section 5.02(b),
the  Company  will use  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  solicit  from its
stockholders  proxies in favor of the  Stockholder  Approval.  The Company shall
keep Parent  updated with respect to proxy  solicitation  results as  reasonably
requested by Parent.

     SECTION 6.02.  Access to  Information;  Confidentiality.  The Company shall
afford to Parent, and to Parent's  officers,  employees,  accountants,  counsel,
consultants,  financial  advisors and other  Representatives,  reasonable access
during normal  business  hours during the period prior to the Effective  Time or

<PAGE>

                                                                              48

the  termination  of  this  Agreement  to  all  of  its  and  its  Subsidiaries'
properties,  books and  records  and to those  employees  of the Company to whom
Parent reasonably  requests access,  and, during such period,  the Company shall
furnish,  as promptly as practicable,  to Parent all information  concerning its
and  its  Subsidiaries'  business,   properties  and  personnel  as  Parent  may
reasonably  request (it being  agreed,  however,  that the  foregoing  shall not
permit Parent or any such  Representatives to conduct any soil or groundwater or
other invasive environmental testing or sampling without the Company's consent).
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where the Company
reasonably  determines  that such  access or  disclosure  would  jeopardize  the
attorney-client  privilege  of  the  Company  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  or
contravene  any  Law  or  any  Contract  to  which  the  Company  or  any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms
of the  confidentiality  letter  agreement  dated as of March 30, 2007,  between
Parent  and  the  Company  (as  it  may  be  amended  from  time  to  time,  the
"Confidentiality  Agreement"),  Parent shall hold, and shall cause its officers,
employees,  accountants,  counsel,  consultants,  financial  advisors  and other
Representatives  to hold,  all  information  received  from the  Company  or its
Representatives,  directly or indirectly,  in confidence in accordance  with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

     SECTION 6.03.  Reasonable  Best Efforts.  (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,  and
to do, or cause to be done,  and to assist and cooperate  with the other parties
in doing,  all things  necessary,  proper or  advisable to  consummate  and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,  the Merger and the other
transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement,  including using  reasonable best
efforts to accomplish  the  following:  (i) the taking of all acts  necessary to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii)
the  obtaining of all necessary  actions or  nonactions,  waivers,  consents and
approvals   from   Governmental   Entities  and  the  making  of  all  necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the
taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or  proceeding  by, any  Governmental  Entity,  including the
issuance or  reissuance  of any and all  required  state,  county or licenses or
permits  required  for the  operation  of the  Company's  business as  currently
conduct,  (iii) the  obtaining  of  consents,  approvals  and waivers from third
parties  reasonably  requested by Parent to be obtained in  connection  with the
Acquisition under any Contracts or leases,  provided,  however, that in no event
shall the  Company or any of its  Subsidiaries  be  required to pay prior to the
Effective Time any fee,  penalty or other  consideration to any person to obtain
any such  consent,  approval or waiver other than de minimus  amounts or amounts
that are  advanced  by  Parent,  and  (iv) the  execution  and  delivery  of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
and to fully carry out the purposes of, this  Agreement.  In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of Directors shall (A)
take all action  necessary  to ensure  that no fair price,  moratorium,  control
share  acquisition or other state takeover  statute is or becomes  applicable to

<PAGE>

                                                                              49

this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (B) if any fair price,  moratorium,  control share  acquisition or
other state takeover statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other  transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement  may be  consummated  as  promptly as  practicable  on the terms
contemplated  by this  Agreement  and  otherwise  to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement,  the Merger and the other  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b) In  furtherance  and not in  limitation  of the  foregoing,  each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate  filing of a  Notification  and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement  as promptly as  reasonably  practicable  after the date hereof and to
supply as promptly as reasonably  practicable  any  additional  information  and
documentary  material that may be requested  pursuant to the HSR Act and use its
reasonable  best  efforts  to  take or  cause  to be  taken  all  other  actions
necessary,  proper or advisable  consistent  with this Section 6.03 to cause the
expiration or  termination  of the  applicable  waiting  periods,  or receipt of
required authorizations,  as applicable,  under the HSR Act; provided that in no
event shall Parent be required to divest any stock,  partnership,  membership or
other ownership interest in any entity, or agree to undertake any divestiture or
restrict  its  conduct  with  regard  to  any  business.  Without  limiting  the
foregoing,  the parties shall request and shall use their respective  reasonable
best efforts to obtain  early  termination  of the waiting  period under the HSR
Act. No party shall  voluntarily  extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
enter  into  any  agreement  with  any  Governmental  Entity  to delay or not to
consummate  the  Merger or any of the other  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement except with the prior written consent of the other party (such consent
not to be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed and which  reasonableness  shall be
determined  in light of each  party's  obligation  to do all  things  necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make  effective,  in the most  expeditious
manner practicable,  the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement).

     SECTION 6.04.  Benefit Plans. (a) The Surviving  Corporation  shall provide
cash  compensation  (excluding  severance) to each Company  Employee that is not
less  favorable  than the cash  compensation  provided to such Company  Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, and any vacation, paid time-off or severance plan maintained by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries for all purposes,  including determining  eligibility
to  participate,   level  of  benefits,  vesting,  benefit  accruals  and  early
retirement subsidies, each Company Employee's service with the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries  (as well as  service  with any  predecessor  employer  of the
Company or any such  Subsidiary,  to the  extent  service  with the  predecessor
employer is  recognized by the Company or such  Subsidiary)  shall be treated as
service with Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries;  provided,  however,  that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition  would result
in any duplication of benefits.

                                                                              50

     (c) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived,  any pre-existing  condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under
any welfare  benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in which
Company   Employees  (and  their  eligible   dependents)  will  be  eligible  to
participate  from and after the Effective  Time,  except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations,  exclusions,  actively-at-work  requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company  Benefit Plan  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time.  Parent shall
recognize,  or cause to be  recognized,  the dollar  amount of all  co-payments,
deductibles and similar  expenses  incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible  dependents)  during the calendar year in which the Effective  Time
occurs  for  purposes  of  satisfying  such  year's  deductible  and  co-payment
limitations  under the  relevant  welfare  benefit  plans in which  they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

     SECTION 6.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating
thereto  now  existing  in favor of any person who is or prior to the  Effective
Time  becomes,  or has been at any time prior to the date of this  Agreement,  a
director,  officer,  employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to
an employee  benefit  plan) of the Company,  any of its  Subsidiaries  or any of
their respective  predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the
Company  Certificate of Incorporation,  the Company Bylaws,  the  organizational
documents  of any  Subsidiary  of the Company or any  indemnification  agreement
between such  Indemnified  Party and the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (in
each  case,   as  in  effect  on  the  date  hereof  or,  with  respect  to  any
indemnification  agreement entered into after the date hereof, to the extent the
terms thereof are no more favorable in any material  respect to the  Indemnified
Party  that is the  beneficiary  thereof  than the terms of any  indemnification
agreement  included as an exhibit in the Filed SEC Documents)  shall survive the
Merger and shall not be amended,  repealed or  otherwise  modified in any manner
that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

     (b) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time,  prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of acts
or omissions  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the
Effective Time,  covering each  Indemnified  Party on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less  favorable than those of such policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement;  provided,  however, that, without the prior written
consent of Parent,  the Company may not expend therefor in excess of 250% of the
amount (the "Annual  Amount") paid by the Company for coverage for the period of
12 months  beginning  on December  15,  2006.  In the event the Company does not
obtain such "tail" insurance policies,  then, for a period of six years from the
Effective  Time,  Parent shall cause the  Surviving  Corporation  to maintain in
effect the  Company's  current  directors'  and  officers'  liability  insurance
policies in respect of acts or omissions  occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such coverage and
amounts no less  favorable  than those of such policies in effect on the date of

<PAGE>

                                                                              51

this Agreement; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor  policies  of a  reputable  and  financially  sound  insurance  company
containing  terms,  including  with  respect to coverage  and  amounts,  no less
favorable  to  any  Indemnified  Party;  provided  further,   however,  that  in
satisfying its obligation  under this Section 6.05(c) the Surviving  Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay for  coverage  for any 12-month  period  aggregate
premiums  for  insurance  in  excess  of 250% of the  Annual  Amount,  it  being
understood  and agreed that the  Surviving  Corporation  shall  nevertheless  be
obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for the Annual Amount.

     (c) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving  Corporation or any of
their respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the  continuing  or surviving  corporation  or entity of
such  consolidation  or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any person, or if Parent dissolves
the  Surviving  Corporation,  then,  and in each such case,  Parent  shall cause
proper  provision to be made so that the  applicable  successors  and assigns or
transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

     (d) The  provisions of this Section 6.05 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
contract or otherwise.

     SECTION 6.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in Section 6.06(b),
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

     (b) In the event  that (i) this  Agreement  is  terminated  by the  Company
pursuant  to  Section  8.01(f),  (ii) (A)  after the date of this  Agreement,  a
Takeover  Proposal  shall have been  publicly  made to the Company  generally or
shall have otherwise  become publicly known,  (B) thereafter,  this Agreement is
terminated by Parent  pursuant to Section  8.01(e)(i) or by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section  8.01(b)(i) (but only if the  Stockholders'  Meeting
has not been held) or Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (C) within nine months after such
termination,  the  Company  consummates  the  transactions  contemplated  by any
Takeover  Proposal,  or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section  8.01(e)(ii),  then  the  Company  shall  pay  Parent  a  fee  equal  to
$60,000,000  (the  "Termination  Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds (1) in
the case of a payment  required by clause (i) above,  on the date of termination
of this Agreement,  (2) in the case of a payment  required by clause (ii) above,
on the date of the  consummation  referred to in clause (ii)(C),  and (3) in the
case of a payment  required by clause (iii) above,  as promptly as possible (but
in any event within four business days).  For purposes of this Section  6.06(b),
the term  "Takeover  Proposal"  shall have the meaning  assigned to such term in
Section 5.02(a), except that all references to 20% therein shall be deemed to be
references to 50%.
<PAGE>

                                                                              52

     (c) The Company  acknowledges  and agrees that the agreements  contained in
Section  6.06(b) are an integral part of the  transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement,  and that,  without these  agreements,  Parent would not have entered
into this  Agreement;  accordingly,  if the  Company  fails  promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to Section  6.06(b),  and, in order to obtain such  payment,
Parent  commences a suit that results in a judgment  against the Company for the
Termination  Fee,  the  Company  shall  pay to Parent  its  costs  and  expenses
(including  attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
with  interest on the amount of the  Termination  Fee from the date such payment
was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

     SECTION 6.07.  Public  Announcements.  Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before  issuing,  and give each other the  opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public  statements  with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation,  except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or the
rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation  system and except for any matters  referred to in Section  5.02.  The
parties  agree that the initial  press  release to be issued with respect to the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  shall be in the form  heretofore
agreed to by the parties.

     SECTION  6.08.  Stockholder  Litigation.  The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity  to  participate  in the defense or  settlement  of any  stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement,  and no such  settlement  shall be  agreed  to
without  Parent's  prior written  consent  (such consent not to be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

     SECTION 6.09. Financing. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
provide,  shall cause its  Subsidiaries  to provide and shall use its reasonable
best  efforts  to cause  its and  their  Representatives  (including  legal  and
accounting)  to provide  such  reasonable  cooperation  in  connection  with the
arrangement of the Debt  Financing as may be reasonably  requested in writing by
Parent with  reasonable  notice in  connection  with the  obtaining  of the Debt
Financing,  including  using  reasonable  best  efforts  to (i)  participate  in
meetings,  presentations,  due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows
and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assist with the preparation of materials
for rating agency presentations, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda
or similar  offering  documents  required in connection with the Debt Financing,
(iii) reasonably facilitate the pledging of collateral,  in each case so long as
not effective  until at or after the Effective Time, (iv) furnish Parent and its
Financing  sources with (A) readily  available  historical  financial  and other
pertinent information that, as of any date, would be required to be contained in
filings by the Company  with the SEC on Forms 10 Q and 10 K as of such date,  in
each case as may be reasonably requested by Parent (collectively,  the "Required
Financial  Information"),  and (B) any other historical financial statements and
other financial data of the type reasonably  requested by Parent, (v) permit the

<PAGE>

                                                                              53

prospective  lenders  involved in the Debt  Financing to evaluate the  Company's
current assets, cash management and accounting systems,  policies and procedures
relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral  arrangements,  (vi)
establish  bank and other accounts and blocked  account  agreements and lock box
arrangements in connection with the foregoing,  and (vii) take corporate actions
reasonably  necessary to permit the  consummation  of the Debt  Financing and to
permit the proceeds  thereof to be made  available  to the Company.  The Company
shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to (1)  provide  monthly  financial
statements  (excluding  footnotes) within 25 days of the end of each month prior
to the Closing Date, if and in the form currently  prepared by the Company,  (2)
obtain accountants' comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance
as may be requested by Parent or the prospective  lenders in the Debt Financing,
(3) cause its  officers,  in their  capacities  as  officers,  to  deliver  such
customary  management  representation  letters as any audit firm may  request in
connection with any comfort letters or similar documents  required in connection
with the Debt  Financing,  (4) obtain the  issuance  or  reissuance  of required
state,  county or city licenses or permits  required for the operation after the
Closing Date of the Company's business and (5) obtain estoppel certificates from
landlords  under Real  Property  Leases  and from  tenants  under Real  Property
Subleases.  It is understood  and agreed that nothing  contained in this Section
6.09  shall  require  such  cooperation  to the extent  that it would  interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its  Subsidiaries'  Trademarks
in connection with the Financing,  provided that such Trademarks are used solely
in a manner that is not intended to nor  reasonably  likely to harm or disparage
the Company or the  reputation  or  goodwill of the Company and its  Trademarks.
Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries  shall be  required,  under the
provisions  of this Section 6.09 or otherwise in  connection  with the Financing
(x) to pay any  commitment or other similar fee prior to the Effective Time that
is not advanced by Parent or (y) to incur any out-of-pocket  expense unless such
expense is  advanced  by Parent.  Parent and Sub shall,  on a joint and  several
basis,  indemnify  and hold  harmless the Company,  its  Subsidiaries  and their
respective  Representatives  from and  against  any and all losses  suffered  or
incurred by them in  connection  with (1) any action taken by them in compliance
with this  Section  6.09,  or at the request of Parent  pursuant to this Section
6.09, or otherwise in connection  with the  arrangement  of the Financing or (2)
any  information  utilized in connection  therewith  (other than the information
provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries).  Nothing contained in this Section
6.09 or  otherwise  shall  require the Company to be an issuer or other  obligor
with  respect  to the  Financing  prior to the  Effective  Time.  All  material,
non-public  information  regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries  provided to
Parent  or its  Representatives  pursuant  to this  Section  6.09  shall be kept
confidential by them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement except for
disclosure to potential  investors as required in connection  with the Financing
subject to customary confidentiality protection.

     (b) For purposes of this Agreement,  "Bridge  Marketing  Period" shall mean
the  first  period  of 15  consecutive  business  days  after  the  date  hereof
throughout  which (A) Parent  shall have in all  material  respects the Required
Financial  Information  that the Company is required to use its reasonable  best
efforts to provide to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.09,  provided,  that the

                                                                              54

Required Financial  Information required to be filed with the SEC must be timely
filed  (or must be cured if  previously  required  to be filed)  throughout  the
Bridge  Marketing  Period,  (B) the  conditions  set forth in  Section  7.01 and
Section 7.02 shall be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing,  but subject to the  satisfaction or, to the
extent  permitted by Law,  waiver of those  conditions),  and (C) the applicable
auditors  shall not have  withdrawn  their  audit  opinions  for any  applicable
Required Financial Information; provided, that such 15 business day period shall
commence no earlier than three  business  days after the  condition set forth in
Section  7.01(a) has been satisfied (it being  understood and agreed that Parent
will commence such period on an earlier date if reasonably  practicable to do so
in its good faith  judgment,  provided  that in such event the period  shall not
commence  more  than 15  business  days  prior to the date of the  Stockholders'
Meeting and the Bridge  Marketing  Period shall extend until the third  business
day after  satisfaction  of the  condition set forth in Section  7.01(a));  and,
provided,  further,  that  notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the Bridge Marketing
Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which the  Financing is
consummated.

     (c) Each of Parent and Sub shall use, and shall cause their  Affiliates  to
use, their  reasonable  best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,  all actions
and to do, or cause to be done,  all things  necessary,  proper or  advisable to
arrange the  Financing on the terms and  conditions  described in the  Financing
Commitments,  including  using its reasonable  best efforts to (i) negotiate and
enter  into the  definitive  agreements  with  respect  thereto on the terms and
conditions  contained in the Financing  Commitments,  (ii) satisfy (or cause its
Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions  applicable to Parent or
Sub (or  their  Affiliates)  set  forth  therein  and  (iii) to  consummate  the
Financing  contemplated  by the Financing  Commitments  on the date described in
Section 2.02,  including  using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders
and other  persons  providing  such  Financing to fund the Bridge  Financing and
Equity  Financing  required to consummate  the Merger at such time. In the event
that  any  portion  of  the  Financing  becomes  unavailable  on the  terms  and
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, Parent and Sub shall promptly
notify  the  Company  and shall  use their  reasonable  best  efforts  to obtain
alternative  financing from  alternative  sources,  on terms not materially less
favorable,  taken as a whole, to Parent and Sub (as determined in the reasonable
judgment of Parent), as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event.  Parent  shall  deliver to the Company  true and  complete  copies of all
agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to
provide Parent and Sub with any portion of the Financing. Each of Parent and Sub
shall refrain (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates
to  refrain)  from  taking,  directly  or  indirectly,  any  action  that  would
reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the conditions contained
in the  Financing  Commitments  or in any  definitive  agreement  related to the
Financing.  Neither  Parent  nor Sub  shall  agree to or permit  any  amendment,
supplement  or other  modification  of, or waive any of its  rights  under,  any
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, in
each case,  without the Company's prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), if such amendment,  modification or waiver
would impose new or additional  conditions or otherwise  amend,  modify or waive
any of the  conditions  to the receipt of the Financing in any manner that would

<PAGE>

                                                                              55

be  reasonably  likely to cause a  material  delay in the  ability  of Parent to
consummate the Financing.  In such event,  the term  "Financing  Commitments" as
used herein shall be deemed to include the Financing Commitments that are not so
superseded  at the time in question  and the new  Financing  Commitments  to the
extent then in effect. Parent and Sub shall keep the Company reasonably informed
of the status of their efforts to obtain the Financing.


                                  ARTICLE VII

                              Conditions Precedent

     SECTION 7.01.  Conditions to Each Party's  Obligation to Effect the Merger.
The  respective  obligation of each party to effect the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction  or (to the  extent  permitted  by Law)  waiver  at or prior to the
Effective Time of the following conditions:

     (a)  Stockholder  Approval.   The  Stockholder  Approval  shall  have  been
obtained.

     (b) HSR Act. The waiting period (and any extension  thereof)  applicable to
the Merger under the HSR Act shall have been terminated or shall have expired.

     (c) No  Injunctions  or Restraints;  Illegality.  No temporary  restraining
order,  preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by
any   Federal  or  state   court  of   competent   jurisdiction   (collectively,
"Restraints") or Law shall be in effect  enjoining,  making illegal or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;  provided,  however,  that the party
claiming such failure of condition  shall have used its reasonable  best efforts
to prevent  the entry of any such  injunction  or order,  including  taking such
action as is required to comply with Section 6.03,  and to appeal as promptly as
possible any injunction or other order that may be entered.

     SECTION 7.02.  Conditions to Obligations of Parent and Sub. The obligations
of Parent and Sub to effect the Merger are further  subject to the  satisfaction
or (to the extent  permitted by Law) waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of
the following conditions:

     (a) Representations  and Warranties.  The representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct  (disregarding
all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect"
and words of similar  import set forth therein) as of the date of this Agreement
and as of the Closing  Date as though  made on such dates  (except to the extent
such  representations  and  warranties  expressly  relate to an earlier date, in
which  case  as of  such  earlier  date),  except  where  the  failure  of  such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the
aggregate,  has not had, or would not  reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect;  provided,  however,  that the representations and warranties of
the  Company  set forth in  Section  4.01(c)(i)  with  respect  to the number of

<PAGE>

                                                                              56

outstanding  shares of  Company  Common  Stock and  number of shares of  Company
Common Stock  subject to  outstanding  Company Stock  Options,  Company SARs and
ESPPs shall be true and correct in all material  respects as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on such dates (except to the
extent such  representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date,
in which case as of such earlier date). Parent shall have received a certificate
signed  on behalf  of the  Company  by the  chief  executive  officer  and chief
financial officer of the Company to such effect.

     (b)  Performance of Obligations of the Company.  The Company shall have, in
all material respects, performed or complied with all obligations required to be
performed  or  complied  with by it  under  this  Agreement  by the  time of the
Closing,  and Parent shall have received a  certificate  signed on behalf of the
Company  by the chief  executive  officer  and chief  financial  officer  of the
Company to such effect.

     (c) No Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there has
not been nor would there reasonably be expected to be a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 7.03.  Conditions to Obligation of the Company.  The  obligation of
the Company to effect the Merger is further  subject to the  satisfaction or (to
the extent  permitted  by Law) waiver at or prior to the  Effective  Time of the
following conditions:

     (a) Representations  and Warranties.  The representations and warranties of
Parent  and  Sub  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  shall  be  true  and  correct
(disregarding all  qualifications  or limitations as to  "materiality",  "Parent
Material  Adverse  Effect" and words of similar  import set forth therein) as of
the date of this  Agreement  and as of the  Closing  Date as though made on such
dates (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate
to an earlier  date,  in which case as of such earlier  date),  except where the
failure  of such  representations  and  warranties  to be so true  and  correct,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  has not had,  or would  not  reasonably  be
expected  to have a Parent  Material  Adverse  Effect.  The  Company  shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the chief executive officer
and chief financial officer of Parent to such effect.

     (b)  Performance  of  Obligations of Parent and Sub. Each of Parent and Sub
shall have, in all material respects, performed or complied with all obligations
required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement by the time
of the Closing,  and the Company  shall have  received a  certificate  signed on
behalf of Parent by the chief executive  officer and chief financial  officer of
Parent to such effect.

     SECTION  7.04.  Frustration  of Closing  Conditions.  None of the  Company,
Parent or Sub may rely on the  failure  of any  condition  set forth in  Section
7.01,  7.02 or 7.03,  as the case may be, to be  satisfied  if such  failure was
caused by such  party's  failure to perform  any of its  obligations  under this
Agreement,  to act in  good  faith  or to use its  reasonable  best  efforts  to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
as required by and subject to Section 6.03.

                        Termination, Amendment and Waiver

     SECTION  8.01.  Termination.  This  Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time,  whether before or after receipt of the Stockholder
Approval:

     (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

     (b) by either Parent or the Company:

          (i) if the Merger shall not have been  consummated  on or before April
     15,  2008  (the  "Outside  Date");  provided,  however,  that the  right to
     terminate  this  Agreement  under  this  Section  8.01(b)(i)  shall  not be
     available  to any  party if the  failure  of such  party (or in the case of
     Parent,  Sub) to perform any of its obligations  under this Agreement,  the
     failure to act in good  faith or the  failure  to use its  reasonable  best
     efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
     this  Agreement,  as required by and  subject to Section  6.03,  has been a
     principal  cause  of or  resulted  in  the  failure  of  the  Merger  to be
     consummated on or before such date;

          (ii) if any  Restraint  having any of the effects set forth in Section
     7.01(c) shall have become final and nonappealable;  provided that the party
     seeking to terminate  this Agreement  pursuant to this Section  8.01(b)(ii)
     shall have used  reasonable  best  efforts  to prevent  the entry of and to
     remove such Restraint; or

          (iii) if the Stockholder  Approval shall not have been obtained at the
     Stockholders'  Meeting  duly  convened  therefor or at any  adjournment  or
     postponement thereof;

     (c)  by  Parent,   if  the  Company   shall  have   breached   any  of  its
representations  or  warranties  or failed to perform  any of its  covenants  or
agreements set forth in this  Agreement,  which breach or failure to perform (i)
would give rise to the  failure of a condition  set forth in Section  7.02(a) or
7.02(b) and (ii) is  incapable  of being cured or is not cured within 60 days of
written  notice of such breach or failure;  provided  that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if Parent
or Sub is then in  material  breach of any of its  representations,  warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder;

     (d)  by  the   Company,   if  Parent   shall  have   breached  any  of  its
representations  or  warranties  or failed to perform  any of its  covenants  or
agreements set forth in this  Agreement,  which breach or failure to perform (i)
would give rise to the  failure of a condition  set forth in Section  7.03(a) or
7.03(b) and (ii) is  incapable  of being cured or is not cured within 60 days of
written  notice of such breach or failure;  provided  that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this Section  8.01(d) if
the  Company  is  then  in  material  breach  of  any  of  its  representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder;

                                                                              58

     (e) by Parent:

          (i) in the event  that an  Adverse  Recommendation  Change  shall have
     occurred; or

          (ii) the Company or any of its  Representatives  shall have  willfully
     breached Section 5.02 in any respect materially adverse to Parent; or

     (f) by the Company, in accordance with Section 5.02(b).

     SECTION 8.02.  Effect of  Termination.  In the event of termination of this
Agreement  by either the  Company or Parent as provided  in Section  8.01,  this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect,  without any liability
or  obligation  on the  part of  Parent,  Sub or the  Company,  other  than  the
provisions of the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section 6.06, this Section 8.02
and Article IX,  which  provisions  shall  survive such  termination;  provided,
however  that  nothing  herein  shall  relieve the  Company,  Parent or Sub from
liability  for any willful and  material  breach of any of its  representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

     SECTION  8.03.  Amendment.  This  Agreement  may be amended by the  parties
hereto  at any  time  before  or  after  receipt  of the  Stockholder  Approval;
provided,  however,  that after such approval has been obtained,  there shall be
made no amendment that by Law requires  further  approval by the stockholders of
the Company without such approval  having been obtained.  This Agreement may not
be amended  except by an instrument  in writing  signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

     SECTION 8.04.  Extension;  Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the  parties  may  (a)  extend  the  time  for  the  performance  of  any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties,  (b) to the extent  permitted by
Law, waive any  inaccuracies  in the  representations  and warranties  contained
herein  or in any  document  delivered  pursuant  hereto or (c)  subject  to the
proviso to the first  sentence of Section  8.03 and to the extent  permitted  by
Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any  agreement  on the part of a party to any such  extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an  instrument  in  writing  signed on behalf of such
party.  The failure of any party to this  Agreement  to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

     SECTION 8.05. Procedure for Termination or Amendment. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.03 shall, in order to be effective,  require, in the case of Parent or
the Company,  action by its Board of Directors or, with respect to any amendment
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03, the duly authorized committee of its
Board of Directors to the extent permitted by Law.

     SECTION 9.03.  Consents and Approvals.  For any matter under this Agreement
requiring  the  consent or  approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing.

     SECTION 9.04.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile),  all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

     SECTION  9.05.  Entire  Agreement;  No  Third-Party   Beneficiaries.   This
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement,
and supersede all prior  agreements and  understandings,  both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject  matter of this  Agreement and the
Confidentiality  Agreement,  provided that the  Confidentiality  Agreement shall
survive the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement,  and (b) except for the
provisions  of Section 3.02 after the Effective  Time and Section 6.05,  are not
intended to confer upon any person other than the parties any legal or equitable
rights or remedies.

     SECTION  9.06.  GOVERNING  LAW.  THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,  REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF
LAWS THEREOF.

     SECTION  9.07.  Assignment.  Neither this  Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations  hereunder  shall be assigned,  in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise  by any of the parties  without the prior  written
consent of the other parties,  and any assignment  without such consent shall be
null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon,  inure to the  benefit  of, and be  enforceable  by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Sub
may  assign  this  Agreement  or any of its  rights,  interests  or  obligations
hereunder  to any wholly  owned  Subsidiary  of Parent,  provided  that any such
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Sub of its obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 9.08. Specific  Enforcement;  Consent to Jurisdiction.  The parties
agree that  irreparable  damage would occur and that the parties  would not have

                                                                              61

any  adequate  remedy at law in the  event  that any of the  provisions  of this
Agreement  were not performed in accordance  with their  specific  terms or were
otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or  injunctions  to prevent  breaches of this  Agreement and to
enforce  specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
the State of  Delaware or any Federal  court  sitting in the State of  Delaware,
this being in addition to any other  remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery,  any other court
of the State of Delaware and any Federal  court sitting in the State of Delaware
in the  event any  dispute  arises  out of this  Agreement  or the  transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement,  (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal  jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any
such court and (c) agrees  that it will not bring any  action  relating  to this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in any court other
than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall
be  unavailable,  any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal  court
sitting in the State of Delaware).

     SECTION  9.09.  Severability.  If any  term  or  other  provision  of  this
Agreement is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy,  all other  conditions and provisions of this Agreement  shall
nevertheless  remain in full force and effect.  Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties  hereto shall  negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original  intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent  permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable  manner to the end that the
