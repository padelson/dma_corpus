however, that such access shall be in a manner that does not interfere with
the normal business operations of ACS or its Affiliates.

(g) Subject to Section 2.3(h), if (i) the Purchase Price as adjusted to
account for the amount of the Estimated Subscriber Adjustment, Estimated
Eligible Accounts Receivable, the Estimated Assumed Subscriber Liabilities and
the Estimated AWN Account Payable exceeds (ii) the Purchase Price as adjusted
to account for the amounts of the Subscriber Adjustment, Eligible Accounts
Receivable, Assumed Subscriber Liabilities and AWN Account Payable accepted by
GCI or set forth in the Closing Calculation Statement, as applicable, then ACS
shall pay to GCI an amount equal to such excess. If (i) the Purchase Price as
adjusted to account for the amounts of the Subscriber Adjustment, Eligible
Accounts Receivable, Assumed Subscriber Liabilities and AWN Account Payable
accepted by GCI or set forth in the Closing Calculation Statement, as
applicable,



21

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





exceeds (ii) the Purchase Price as adjusted to account for the amount of the
Estimated Subscriber Adjustment, Estimated Eligible Accounts Receivable,
Estimated Assumed Subscriber Liabilities and Estimated AWN Account Payables,
then GCI shall pay to ACS an amount equal to such excess. The amount payable
pursuant to this Section 2.3(g) is referred to as the "Post-Closing
Adjustment".

(h) (i) Examination. After receipt of the Closing Calculation Statement, ACS
shall have 30 days (the "Review Period") to review the Closing Calculation
Statement. During the Review Period, ACS shall have full access to the books
and records of GCI, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, GCI, its
Affiliates and/or their respective accountants to the extent that they relate
to the Closing Calculation Statement and to such historical financial
information (to the extent in such Person's possession) relating to the
Closing Calculation Statement as ACS may reasonably request (at reasonable
times) for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Calculation Statement and to
prepare a Statement of Objections (defined below), provided, however, that
such access shall be in a manner that does not interfere with the normal
business operations of GCI or its Affiliates.

(ii) Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, ACS may
object to the Closing Calculation Statement by delivering to GCI a written
statement setting forth objections of ACS in reasonable detail, indicating
each disputed item or amount and the basis for ACS's disagreement therewith
(the "Statement of Objections"). If ACS fails to deliver the Statement of
Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Calculation
Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, shall be deemed
to have been accepted by ACS. If ACS delivers the Statement of Objections
before the expiration of the Review Period, GCI and ACS shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve such objections within 30 days after the delivery of the
Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if the same are so
resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the
Closing Calculation Statement with such changes as may have been previously
agreed in writing by GCI and ACS, shall be final and binding.

(iii) Resolution of Disputes. If ACS and GCI fail to reach an agreement with
respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections before
expiration of the Resolution Period (any amounts remaining in dispute,
"Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the "Undisputed Amounts"),
then GCI and ACS shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants other
than GCI's accountants or ACS's accountants (the "Independent Accountant")
who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts
only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If GCI and ACS
are unable to so select the Independent Accountant within 20 days after the
end of the Resolution Period, the American Arbitration Association shall make
such selection. The Parties agree that all adjustments shall be made without
regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall only decide the
specific items under dispute by the Parties and their decision for each
Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item
in the Closing Calculation Statement and the Statement of Objections,
respectively.

(iv) Fees of the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by ACS, on the one hand, and by GCI, on
the other hand,



22

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





based upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded
to ACS or GCI, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested
by ACS and GCI.

(v) Determination by Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall
make a determination as soon as practicable within 30 days (or such other time
as the Parties shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and their
resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments to the Closing
Calculation Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

(vi) Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any payment of the amounts set forth in Section 2.3(g) in respect of the Post-
Closing Adjustment, together with interest calculated as set forth below,
shall (A) be due (x) within ten Business Days of acceptance of the applicable
Closing Calculation Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then, with
respect to any Undisputed Amounts, within ten Business Days of the agreement
with respect to such Undisputed Amounts and, with respect to Disputed Amounts,
within ten Business Days of the resolution described in clause (v) above; and
(B) be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as
is directed by GCI or ACS, as the case may be. The Post-Closing Adjustment
shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to 10%. Such interest shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days
elapsed.

(i) For purposes of this Section 2.3, the methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures for the calculation of amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.3 shall be as set forth on Schedule 2.3 for the respective Purchase
Price adjustment as specified on such Schedule.

2.4 Excluded Assets. The ACS Assets being sold hereunder shall exclude the
following assets:

(a) Each member of the ACS Group's cash on hand as of the Closing Date and all

ACS Group;

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACS ASSETS AND THE ACS AWN
INTEREST 

Each of ACS and ACS Wireless, jointly and severally, represents and warrants
to GCI and GCI Wireless with respect to the ACS Wireless Activities, the ACS
Assets and the ACS AWN Interest, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date (and to the extent related to the Transition Contracts, as of the
Transition Completion Date, and to the extent related to the Assumed Leases or
the Leased Property pursuant to any Assumed Leases, as of the Assumed Leases
Assumption Date) except insofar as such representations and warranties are
made as of the date hereof or any other specified date (in which case as of
such date), as follows:

4.1 Sufficiency of Assets. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.1 and except for
the Excluded Assets, the ACS Assets, together with the ACS AWN Interest and
the rights, assets and services made available pursuant to the Ancillary
Agreements (i) constitute all of the assets, tangible and intangible, of any
nature whatsoever, necessary to conduct the ACS Wireless Activities in
substantially the manner presently operated by the ACS Group and (ii) include
all of the assets of such Person and its Affiliates which are used primarily
in the ACS Wireless Activities.

4.2 Contracts.

(a) ACS has delivered or provided to GCI copies of all material Contracts
(other than Subscriber Contracts and Contracts set forth on Schedule 4.1)
required to enable the ACS Group to conduct the ACS Wireless Activities in all
material respects as presently conducted. True and complete copies of all
Assumed Contracts (together with all amendments thereto) other than Subscriber
Contracts have been delivered to GCI. All Assumed Contracts are in full force
and effect, and are in all material respects valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms. None of the Assumed Contracts would be
materially breached by virtue of the Transactions or by virtue of the
assignments thereof to GCI or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Consents are obtained. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.2, there is not under any Assumed Contract any default by the ACS
Group or any of its Affiliates or, to its Knowledge, any other party thereto,
or any event which, after notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
material default which would give any party the right to terminate such
Assumed Contract. Except as expressly set forth in Schedule 4.2, the ACS Group
has not received any written notice of any intention by any party to any
material Assumed Contract (i) to amend the terms thereof in a manner that
would materially and adversely affect the ACS Group's rights thereunder, or to
terminate such Contract, (ii) to refuse to renew the same upon expiration of
its term, or (iii) to renew the same upon expiration only on terms and
conditions which materially and adversely affect the ACS Group's rights
thereunder.

(b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.2, there are no Assumed Contracts in
effect on the date hereof between the ACS Group or any of its Affiliates and
(i) any of its Affiliates, (ii) any



28

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





of its or its Affiliates' officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers
or "associates" (as defined in the Exchange Act), or (iii) any Affiliate or
"associate" (as defined in the Exchange Act) of any of the Persons listed in
clause (ii).

(c) ACS has delivered to GCI either the form of each type of, or the specific,
Subscriber Contract (consumer and commercial) in electronic or paper form
other than those that were individually negotiated. Other than those
Subscriber Contracts that were individually negotiated, all Subscriber
Contracts conform to the specific Contract previously delivered to GCI or one
of the types of Contract forms previously delivered to GCI. All Subscriber
Contracts that were individually negotiated are on terms that are commercially
reasonable in light of the practices in the industry at the time such
contracts were entered into and such contracts do not contain most favored
nation provisions, restrictions on offerings or providing services to third
parties, requirements of the service providers to make capital expenditures,
prepayments for services to be provided after the Closing Date (other than as
reflected in Assumed Subscriber Liabilities) or termination or expiration
dates later than December 31, 2019. The Subscriber Contracts were entered into
in the ordinary course of business. Upon assignment and transfer of the
Subscriber Contracts to GCI under this Agreement, GCI will have the right to
receive all revenue, fees, and charges associated with the Wireless services
provided pursuant to such Subscriber Contracts after Closing.

4.3 Title to and Condition of Leased Property.

(a) The Leased Property Schedule lists all Leases that ACS proposes to
terminate or assign.

(b) The ACS Group and its Affiliates have marketable title or leasehold
interests, as the case may be, to all Leased Property free and clear of all
Liens except for Liens set forth on the Leased Property Schedule and Permitted
Liens.

(c) All of such Leased Property (i) is in good condition and repair (ordinary
wear and tear excepted), and (ii) subject to receipt of the Consents and
payment of any rent obligations in respect thereto that are not overdue, would
be available for immediate use by GCI for Wireless activities, as of the
applicable transfer date. All Leased Property (i) has been maintained in a
manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards, and (ii) permits
the ACS Wireless Activities to operate in all material respects in accordance
with the terms of the Assumed Contracts and all applicable Legal Requirements
as currently in effect.

4.4 Intellectual Property. Other than (i) the Intellectual Property being
provided pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) any know-how, business
processes and related tools (including models and spreadsheets), there is no
Intellectual Property that any member of the ACS Group uses in connection with
the ACS Wireless Activities that is necessary to conduct the ACS Wireless
Activities in substantially the manner presently operated by the ACS Group,
other than Intellectual Property previously contributed to or otherwise
acquired by the Company. To the Knowledge of ACS, the Intellectual Property
licensed to GCI pursuant to the IP License Agreements, as currently used by
ACS, does not infringe the Intellectual Property of any Third Party in any
material respect.

required to enable the ACS Group or its Affiliates to carry on the ACS
Wireless Activities as presently conducted. All material required reports of
the ACS Group and its Affiliates to the FCC or RCA, including those relating

respects and have been duly filed. The ACS Group and its Affiliates have all
of the material Licenses required under all applicable FCC RCA rules,
regulations and orders for the operations of the ACS Wireless Activities and
to receive Universal Service Support, and are licensed in all material
respects to operate all of the ACS Wireless Activities required by Legal
Requirements to be licensed.

4.7 Insurance and Bonds. The ACS Wireless Activities and the ACS Assets are
insured against claims, loss or damage in amounts set forth in Schedule 4.7.
Schedule 4.7 provides a true and complete list of all surety and performance
bonds or letters of credit maintained in connection with the ACS Wireless

of ACS (i) operations by the ACS Group and its Affiliates with respect to the
ACS Wireless Activities comply in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws; (ii) the ACS Group and its Affiliates have not used any
Leased Property for, and have no Knowledge that such Leased Property has
previously been used for, the manufacture, transportation, treatment, storage
or disposal of Hazardous Substances except for such use of Hazardous

expected to give rise to any material liability for remediation; and (iii)
such Leased Property complies in all material respects with all applicable

ACS, no underground storage tanks have been installed by or are used by the
ACS Group or any of its Affiliates at any of its Leased Property. ACS has
delivered to GCI true and complete copies of all environmental reports and
studies in the possession of or reasonably available to ACS with respect to

Knowledge of ACS, the subject of (x) any "Superfund" evaluation or Proceeding
in connection with its Leased Property, (y) any Proceeding of any Governmental
Authority evaluating whether any remedial action is necessary to respond to
any release of Hazardous Substances on or in connection with its Leased
Property, or (z) any Environmental Claim.

4.9 Taxes and Tax Returns. All Tax Returns relating to the ACS Assets or the
ACS Wireless Activities required to have been filed have been duly and timely
filed with the appropriate



30

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





Governmental Authorities. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects and properly reflect the liabilities for Taxes for
the periods, property or events covered thereby. All material Taxes due and
payable with respect to the ACS Assets or the ACS Wireless Activities have
been timely and duly paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

4.10 Conduct of Activities in Ordinary Course. Since December 31, 2013,

bargaining agreement or other contract with a union, works council or labor
organization (collectively, "Union") that would be binding upon GCI or any of
its Affiliates, that would impose on GCI or any of its Affiliates any duty to
bargain with any Union or that would impose any successor liability or
obligation on GCI or any of its Affiliates or their property.

4.12 Software and Hardware. All material third party software licenses and
hardware used in the ACS Wireless Activities and included in the ACS Assets is
currently supported by the vendor of such software licenses or hardware.

4.13 ACS AWN Interest. ACS Wireless owns the ACS AWN Interest, free and clear
of all Liens except for Liens set forth on Schedule 4.13 and Permitted Liens
described in clause (g) of the definition of Permitted Liens. This Section
4.13 comprises the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of ACS
and ACS Wireless relating to the ACS AWN Interest. For the avoidance of doubt,
ACS and ACS Wireless make no representations or warranties relating to the
assets, liabilities, business or operations of the Company.

4.14 Accounts Receivable. All Accounts Receivable represent fees or charges
for sales actually made or services actually performed in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practices, and all Eligible Accounts
Receivable are legal, validly subsisting and binding claims against the
respective debtors as to which performance has been rendered. Unless paid,

with past practice prior to the Closing Date, to the Knowledge of ACS,
Eligible Accounts Receivable are collectible in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice net of respective reserves against such
Eligible Accounts Receivable, which such reserves are commercially reasonable

correct and complete and accurately depict such network in all material

4.18 CDMA Core Assets. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.18 and except for the
Excluded Assets, the CDMA Core Assets, when combined with the assets and
rights previously transferred, assigned and granted to the Company and the

shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
ACS Wireless Activities, provided, however, that (i) neither the furnishing of
such information to GCI Parent or its representatives nor any investigation
made heretofore or hereafter by GCI Parent shall affect the right of GCI
Parent or its Affiliates to rely on any representation or warranty made by the

SECTION 7.

SPECIAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS 

7.1 Consents.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, ACS shall and shall
cause each member of the ACS Group, as applicable, to request the consent of
such Third Parties whose Consents are required, and thereafter shall and shall
cause each member of the ACS Group, as applicable, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents as expeditiously as possible,
subject to the other provisions of this Section 7.1. No Consent shall include
any material adverse change to the terms of any Assumed Contract unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by GCI. If notwithstanding its good faith
commercially reasonable efforts, the ACS Group is unable to obtain any Consent
(or is unable to cause its Affiliates to obtain any such Consent), ACS shall
not be liable for any breach of this covenant (but GCI and GCI Wireless shall
have no obligation to effect the Closing unless the condition set forth in
Section 8.2(c) shall have been satisfied) except as set forth in Section 7.8.
Nothing herein shall require the expenditure or payment of any funds (other
than in respect of normal and usual filing fees and such Party's attorneys'
fees, other normal costs of doing business or costs described in Section
7.1(c)) or the giving of any other consideration by any Party in order to
obtain any Consent.

(b) To the extent requested by the ACS Group, GCI agrees to cooperate fully
with the ACS Group in obtaining any necessary Consents, but GCI will not be
required (i) to make any payment to any Person from whom such Consent is
sought or (ii) to accept any material adverse changes in, or the imposition of
any material adverse condition to, any Assumed Contract as a condition to
obtaining any Consent. The Parties shall jointly participate in negotiations
with Third Parties with respect to the Consents. Each Party shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the
other Parent (which may be withheld at such Parent's sole discretion), seek
amendments or modifications to the Assumed Contracts which would reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent obtaining any Consents necessary for the Closing.

(c) ACS shall bear any costs required to remedy any item of noncompliance by
ACS or any of its Affiliates with the terms of its Contracts. GCI shall bear
any costs arising with respect to the performance of the Assumed Contracts on
and after the Closing Date (other than any costs arising as a result of
noncompliance by ACS or any of its Affiliates) in accordance with the terms of
any such Assumed Contracts (including any amendments or modifications)
executed or assumed by GCI; provided that, notwithstanding the preceding
provisions of this sentence, GCI shall bear any costs arising with respect to
the Transition Contracts from and after the Transition Completion Date (except
as otherwise provided in the AandR ACS Services Agreement) and with respect to
the Assumed Leases from and after the Assumed Leases Assumption Date, in each
case rather than from and after the Closing Date.

(d) Each Party shall promptly furnish to any Third Party such accurate and
complete information regarding such Party and its Affiliates, including
financial information concerning such Party and its Affiliates (other than
information which such Party reasonably deems to be proprietary), as such
Third Party may reasonably require in connection with obtaining any Consent.
Each Party shall ensure that its appropriate officers and employees shall be
available to attend any scheduled hearings or meetings in connection with
obtaining any Consent.



38

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





(e) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the
FCC and any Subscribers any notice required by the Communications Act to be
delivered in connection with the consummation of the Transactions; provided,
however, that the text of any such notice shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Parties.

7.2 Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate fully in good faith with each
other and their respective counsel and accountants in connection with any
actions required to be taken as part of their respective obligations under
this Agreement, and each Party shall execute such other documents as may be
reasonably necessary to the implementation and consummation of this Agreement,
and otherwise shall use its commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to
do all things necessary, proper or advisable in order to consummate the
Transactions in the most expeditious manner practicable (including using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to Closing set forth
in Section 8 for which such Party is responsible to be satisfied on or before
the Target Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable and, in the case
of GCI Parent, GCI and GCI Wireless, using their commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) obtain financing as contemplated by Sections 5.7 and 8.2(m) and
(ii) enter into the arrangements with CommSoft and other Persons as
contemplated by Section 8.2(n)) and to fulfill its obligations hereunder. ACS
shall take all commercially reasonable steps necessary to transfer the
administrative entity designation (AOCN) authority for OCN 6304 to the GCI
AOCN 7785 and provide to GCI a copy of the most recently filed FCC Form 502
(NRUF) for OCN 6304, in each case no later than 30 days after Closing. Without
limiting the foregoing, if a Governmental Authority requires an arrangement to
be addressed through another form of agreement that requires Governmental
Consent, or asserts that an arrangement requires a Governmental Consent the
Parties did not believe was required, the Parties agree to work in good faith
to obtain that Consent.

7.3 Taxes, Fees and Expenses.

(a) ACS shall, at its expense, prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and
filed) all Tax Returns of ACS or its Affiliates relating to the operation of
the ACS Wireless Activities or the ownership of the ACS Assets or the ACS AWN
Interest for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. GCI shall,
at its expense, prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax
Returns of GCI or its Affiliates relating to the operation of the assets
acquired pursuant to this Agreement for any Tax period ending after the
Closing Date. Each of ACS and GCI will cooperate in good faith in the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns relating to the ACS Assets and the AWN
Interests and provide information to the other Party as is reasonably
necessary for such Tax Returns. The Parties shall treat the Company as having
terminated as a partnership within the meaning of Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the
Code on the Closing Date, and the Company shall, in accordance with Section
11.4 of the Operating Agreement (relating to the filing of Tax Returns), at
its expense, prepare and file all final Tax Returns relating to income Taxes
for the Tax period ending on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall, at its expense, prepare and file all other Tax Returns of the
Company in accordance with Section 11.4 of the Operating Agreement.

(b) ACS shall pay and hold GCI Parent and its Affiliates harmless from any
liability for payment of or otherwise with respect to any Taxes, without
duplication, (i) of ACS or



39

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





its Affiliates or (ii) relating to the operation of the ACS Wireless
Activities or the ownership of the ACS Assets or the ACS AWN Interest for any
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date (for
purposes of this clause (ii), all real property Taxes, personal property Taxes
and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the ACS Assets for a
Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date shall be
apportioned between ACS and GCI based upon the number of days of such period
(which period shall include the Closing Date) included in the pre‑Closing Tax
period and the number of days of such Tax period after the Closing Date).

(c) ACS shall pay, or shall reimburse GCI (to the extent GCI shall have paid)
for, all sales, use, transfer, and recordation and documentary Taxes, if any,
arising out of the transfer by ACS of the ACS Assets to GCI pursuant to this
Agreement.

(d) Upon receipt of any bill for real or personal property Taxes or similar ad
valorem Taxes relating to the ACS Assets, or upon the filing of any Tax Return
with respect to any such ad valorem Taxes, ACS or GCI, as applicable, shall
present a statement to the other setting forth the amount of such Taxes that
is attributable to the portion of the applicable Tax period that ended on the
Closing Date, with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate such prorated amount. The prorated amount shall be paid by the Party
owing it to the other within 30 days after delivery of such statement. Any
payment required under this Section 7.3(d) and not made within 30 days of
delivery of the relevant statement shall bear interest at LIBOR plus 10% per
annum until fully paid.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall pay its
own attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation, authorization, preparation, execution, and performance of this
Agreement; provided, however, that each of ACS and GCI Parent shall pay 50% of
any required filing fees in connection with applications for governmental
approval of the Transactions.

7.4 Brokers. Each Party represents and warrants that, except as set forth in
Schedule 7.4, neither it nor any Person acting on its behalf has incurred any
liability for any finders' or brokers' fees or commissions in connection with
the Transactions.

7.5 Employee Matters.

(a) Neither GCI nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to hire any
employee of ACS or any of its Affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to confer upon any employee of ACS or its Affiliates or such
employee's legal representative or heirs any rights as a third-party
beneficiary or otherwise or any remedies of any kind whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, or the Transactions, including any rights of
employment or continued employment. All rights and obligations created by this
Agreement are solely among the Parties.

(b) ACS shall retain all liabilities with respect to any employees terminated
by ACS or any of its Affiliates prior to or after the Effective Time.

(c) ACS shall comply, as necessary, with the provisions of the Worker
Adjustment and Retaining Notification Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. §2101, et
seq. (the "WARN



40

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





Act"), as it relates to the Transactions, including providing all affected
employees and other necessary persons with any notice that may be required
under the WARN Act.

7.6 Risk of Loss. The risk of any loss, damage or impairment, confiscation or
condemnation of any of the ACS Assets from any cause whatsoever shall be borne
by ACS at all times prior to the completion of the Closing (and prior to the
Transition Completion Date with respect to the Transition Contracts and prior
to the Assumed Leases Assumption Date with respect to the Assumed Leases and
the Leased Property pursuant to any Assumed Leases) as and to the extent
provided in Section 11\. In the event of any loss, damage or impairment,
confiscation or condemnation, the proceeds of any claim for loss payable under
any insurance policy, judgment or award with respect thereto shall be applied
by ACS to repair, replace or restore such ACS Assets to their prior condition
as soon as reasonably practicable after such loss, impairment, condemnation or
confiscation.

7.7 Post-Closing Access to Information. Following the Closing for a period of
24 months, each Party (i) shall allow each other Party and its authorized
representatives reasonable access, on reasonable notice and at such other
Party's expense during normal business hours, to such Party's books and
records, for the purpose of audit, inspection or investigation relating to the
business, tax and financial reporting requirements of such other Party as well
as to any Third-Party claims made against such other Party, relating to or
arising from the acquisition, ownership or conduct of the operations of the
ACS Assets, the AWN Interest or the ACS Wireless Activities during the time
period prior to Closing, and (ii) shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
such other Party or its authorized representatives all information with
respect to the ACS Assets, the AWN Interest and the ACS Wireless Activities as
such other Party may reasonably request, including information necessary to
complete any compliance report or filing applicable to the ACS Wireless
Activities, in each case subject to reasonable confidentiality and use
restrictions. Any such audit, investigation or request for information shall
be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the then-
ongoing business of ACS or GCI, as applicable, and their respective
Affiliates.

7.8 Post-Closing Consents and Subsequent Transfers.

(a) Schedule 7.8 contains a list (the "Subscriber Contract Consent List")
setting forth all Subscriber Contracts as of the Signing Date for which
Consent is required in order to assign or transfer such Subscriber Contracts
pursuant to this Agreement and for which such Consent has not been obtained.
If ACS or ACS Wireless enters into a new Subscriber Contract requiring Consent
pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(1)(iii), ACS shall as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than two Business Days after entering into such Contract,
provide GCI with an updated Schedule 7.8 containing such Contract. On the
earlier of 30 days after the Signing Date or 15 days before the estimated
Closing Date, ACS shall provide copies of all Contracts listed on the
Subscriber Contract Consent List for which Consent has not been obtained. No
later than five Business Days after the delivery by ACS to GCI of such
Contracts, GCI shall notify ACS in writing of any Contracts listed on such
updated Subscriber Contract Consent List that it elects not to assume if
Consent with respect thereto is not obtained by Closing (each such notice, a
"Non-Election Notice"). All Subscriber Contracts listed on the Subscriber
Contract Consent List for which Consent is not obtained by Closing and a Non-
Election Notice is timely received shall not be assumed by GCI and



41

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





will be Excluded Assets. All Subscriber Contracts listed on the Subscriber
Contract Consent List for which Consent is obtained by Closing or a Non-
Election Notice is not timely received shall be assumed by GCI pursuant to
this Agreement as part of the ACS Assets, and all Subscribers under such
Subscriber Contracts shall be included in the Actual Postpaid Subscriber Count
or the Actual Prepaid Subscriber Count, as applicable. All Subscriber
Contracts for which Consent is not obtained by Closing and a Non-Election
Notice has been timely received shall be Excluded Assets and may be terminated
by ACS, assigned to a Third Party or otherwise dealt with in ACS's sole
discretion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
any Ancillary Agreement, ACS's assignments of such Subscriber Contracts shall
not constitute a breach of any non-competition or other provision of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

(b) In the event that ACS shall be unable to obtain prior to Closing (or prior
to the Transition Completion Date with respect to any Transition Contract or
prior to the Assumed Leases Assumption Date with respect to any Assumed
Leases) any Consent required to assign or transfer any of the Assumed
Contracts (other than Subscriber Contracts) to be assigned or transferred by
ACS to GCI, ACS and GCI agree that at the option of GCI, either (1) GCI shall
waive such Consent as a precondition to assignment and such Assumed Contract
shall be assigned by ACS to GCI as part of the ACS Assets, (2) at GCI's
election, such Contract shall be an Excluded Asset (but not an Excluded
Business Customer Contract) and such Contract shall not be assigned or
assumed, or (3) such Assumed Contract to which such Consent relates shall not
be assigned and (i) ACS shall cause such Assumed Contract to remain in effect
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give GCI the benefit of
such Assumed Contract to the same extent as if it had been assigned, and GCI
shall perform the obligations of ACS or its Affiliates under such Assumed
Contract relating to the benefit obtained by GCI, and (ii) ACS and GCI shall
continue to cooperate to try to obtain such Consent as soon as practicable
after Closing or after the Transition Completion Date or the Assumed Contracts
Assumption Date, as applicable, with the provisions of Section 7.1 continuing
to apply to such Consent. Upon the subsequent receipt of any such Consent to
transfer any such Assumed Contract, or upon the subsequent waiver by GCI of
the requirement that such Consent be obtained, such Assumed Contract shall be
automatically assigned to GCI under the terms hereof without any further
action by any Party.

7.9 Confidentiality/Press Releases. Each Party will hold, and will cause its
Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, employees, lenders,
accountants, representatives, agents, consultants and advisors to hold, in
confidence all information (other than such information as may be publicly

reasonable best efforts to resist or resolve such Proceeding; provided,

any additional services provided by Duff and Phelps shall be borne by the Party
requesting such services. Each of ACS and GCI agree that it will accept the
valuation determined by Duff and Phelps as set forth in its valuation report for
financial reporting purposes to the extent applicable after being provided
with an opportunity to review and comment on such report for a period not to
exceed ten Business Days. Each of ACS and GCI will use reasonable best efforts
to cause the valuation report to be issued. Such efforts shall include taking

the Excluded Business Customers Contracts, including any contracted extensions
specifically set forth therein, (ii) GCI will be paid the greater of (A) all
revenues, fees and charges payable by the Excluded Business Customers for

by ACS to the Company to provide Wireless service to the Excluded Business

respect to the Excluded Business Customer Contracts to verify wireless

maintain any Wireless network or system functionality with respect to the
Excluded Business Customers that it or the Company does not provide to any
other Wireless customers. During the period of negotiation, GCI agrees to
provide Wireless services to the Excluded Business Customers on commercially
reasonable terms consistent with the foregoing to the extent practicable, and
use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the terms and conditions of
the Excluded Business Customer Contracts; provided, however, that, other than
with respect to its obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts set
forth above, GCI and its Affiliates shall have no liability to any member of
the ACS Group or to any Excluded Business Customer for failing to comply with
such terms and conditions. During such 180 day period, GCI will bill ACS for
all revenues, fees, and charges payable by the Excluded Business Customers for
Wireless under the terms of the Excluded Business Customer Contracts and ACS
will pay such amounts to GCI on customary commercial terms.

(b) If the Parties fail to reach an agreement with respect to the Excluded
Business Customers within 180 days after Closing, neither GCI nor any of its
Affiliates will have any further obligation to provide Wireless service to the
Excluded Business Customers and ACS will pay to GCI the difference between (a)
the Subscriber Adjustment as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3 and
(b) the Subscriber Adjustment that would have applied if the Excluded Business
Customers were included in the definition of Nonqualifying Subscribers (the
"Excluded Business Customer Payment"). ACS will pay any Excluded Business
Customer Payment to GCI on or before the date that is 15 days after the
expiration of the 180 day period by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by GCI. GCI will have the right to
dispute ACS's calculation of the Excluded Business Customer Payment subject to
the procedures and time frames set forth in Sections 2.3(f), (g), and (h) with
the expiration of the 180 day period being substituted for the Closing Date in
such Sections. Any payment pursuant to this Section 7.19(b) shall be treated
for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

SECTION 10.

RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ON TERMINATION OR BREACH 

10.1 Termination Rights. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing:

(a) At any time by mutual written consent of both ACS and GCI;

(b) By ACS if (A) there have been one or more breaches by GCI Parent, GCI or
GCI Wireless of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement that have not been
waived by ACS and would result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.1 (Conditions to Obligations of ACS Group) and such
breaches have not been cured within ten days after written notice thereof has
been received by GCI Parent or (B) any of the conditions set forth in Section
8.1 (Conditions to Obligations of ACS Group) has become incapable of being
satisfied on or before the Outside Date and has not been waived by ACS;
provided, however, that in each case that ACS and its Affiliates are not in
material breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement;



53

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





(c) By GCI if (A) there have been one or more breaches by ACS or ACS Wireless
of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein or in any Ancillary Agreement that have not been waived by GCI and
would result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 (Conditions to Obligations of GCI and GCI Wireless) and such
breaches have not been cured within ten days after written notice thereof has
been received by ACS or (B) any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2
(Conditions to Obligations of GCI and GCI Wireless) has become incapable of
being satisfied on or before the Outside Date and has not been waived by GCI;
provided, however, that in each case that GCI and its Affiliates are not in
material breach of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein or in any Ancillary Agreement;

(d) By either Party if the Closing hereunder has not taken place within five
months of the Signing Date (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that
neither ACS nor GCI shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(d) if the failure to consummate the Closing by such date
results from material breach by such other Party or any of its Affiliates of
any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein or in any Ancillary Agreement.

In the event of termination by ACS or GCI pursuant to this Section 10.1,
written notice thereof shall promptly be given to the other Party, setting
forth the clause of this Section 10.1 pursuant to which such Party is
terminating and the facts giving rise to such Party's termination right in
reasonable detail, and this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
terminated, without further action by any Party. Upon such termination: (i) if
no Party is in intentional or willful material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, the Parties shall not have any further liability to each other; or
(ii) if any Party shall be in intentional or willful material breach of any
provision of this Agreement, the other Parties shall have all rights and
remedies available at law or equity.

10.2 Specific Performance. Prior to termination of this Agreement, in the
event any Party refuses to perform under the provisions of this Agreement,
monetary damages alone will not be adequate. The other Parties shall therefore
be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that may be available,
including money damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement. In the event of an action by any of the Parties to obtain specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement, each other Party hereby waives the
defense that there is an adequate remedy at law.

SECTION 11.

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION 

11.1 Affiliates. The indemnification rights provided in this Section 11 shall,
in any instance, extend to any Affiliate of either Parent although any
indemnification claims by such Persons shall be made by and through the
Claimant.

11.2 Survival. All representations, warranties and pre‑Closing covenants
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed continuing representations,
warranties and covenants, and shall survive the Closing Date for 18 months
following the Closing Date with respect to any claim by the other Parent as
the Person claiming indemnification (the "Claimant") that a Parent or an
Affiliate



54

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





thereof that is a Party (the "Indemnifier") has breached its representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement or failed to comply with its
pre‑Closing covenants contained herein; provided, however, that the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.3(b) regarding title to
the ACS Assets and Section 4.13 regarding title to the ACS AWN Interest shall
survive for the period of the applicable statute of limitations, and those set
forth in Section 4.8 (Environmental Law) relating to the pre-Closing period
shall survive for five years following the Closing Date. In clarification of
the foregoing, the Parties confirm that the covenants herein to be performed
following the Closing, including under this Section 11, shall survive in each
instance until 18 months after the required performance thereof. Any
investigations by or on behalf of any Party or Knowledge of any Party shall
not constitute a waiver by such Party of its rights to enforce any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein of the other Parties.

11.3 Indemnification by ACS. Subsequent to the Closing, and regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any Party, or any
information or Knowledge any other Party may have, ACS as Indemnifier shall
indemnify and hold GCI Parent, as Claimant, harmless against and with respect
to, and shall reimburse GCI Parent for:

(a) Any and all expenses, losses, liabilities or damages ("Damages") resulting

covenant contained herein by ACS or its Affiliates;

Assumed Contracts (other than Damages described in Section 11.3(e)), but
excluding any and all matters subject to the Continuing Indemnification
Obligations;

(d) (i) Any and all forfeitures, fines or monetary judgments (including
voluntary contributions to the U.S. Treasury paid pursuant to an FCC-approved
Consent Decree or other settlement to which the FCC is a party) in excess of
overpayments of High Cost Universal Service Support from the Universal Service
Fund (each, a "Fine") to the extent that any such Fine results from acts or
omissions of any member of the ACS Group, including but not limited to
deficiencies in the customer billing address, line type, line count or other
information provided by the ACS Group, rather than from acts or omissions by
the Company;

(ii) Any decrease in CETC Cash Flow from the ACS Wireless Activities due to
failure to file any required reports necessary to maintain ACS's eligibility
to receive High Cost Universal Service Support, failure to cooperate with any
FCC or USAC required audit, including a Payment Quality Assurance review, or
other investigation, or failure to respond to lawful process, in each case
before the Closing, except to the extent that such failure resulted from acts
or omissions by the Company with respect to actions required of the Company by
Exhibit F to the FNUA;



55

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





(e) Any and all Damages resulting from any Environmental Claims (regardless of
whether any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.8 is incorrect)
related to the operation of any Leased Property prior to the Effective Time;

(f) Any and all Damages resulting from any claim that a collective bargaining
agreement or other contract with a Union is binding upon GCI Parent or any of
its Affiliates or imposes on GCI Parent or any of its Affiliates any duty to
bargain with any Union to the extent such claim relates to any collective
bargaining agreement or other contract with a Union by ACS or any of its
Affiliates; and

(g) Any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments,
judgments, reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, incident to any of the foregoing or reasonably incurred in
investigating or attempting to avoid the same or to oppose the imposition
thereof, or in enforcing this indemnity.

11.4 Indemnification by GCI. Subsequent to the Closing, GCI Parent, GCI and
GCI Wireless shall indemnify and hold ACS and ACS Wireless harmless against
and with respect to, and shall reimburse ACS and ACS Wireless for:

(a) Any and all Damages resulting from any untrue representation, breach of
warranty or nonfulfillment of any covenant contained herein by GCI or its
Affiliates;

(b) Any and all Damages resulting from (i) GCI's operation or ownership of the
ACS Assets or the ACS Wireless Activities on and after the Effective Time,
including any and all liabilities arising under the Assumed Contracts (other

precondition to such assignment; and

(d) Any and all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments,
judgments, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
incident to any of the foregoing or incurred in investigating or attempting to
avoid the same or to oppose the imposition thereof, or in enforcing this
indemnity.

11.5 Procedure for Indemnification. The procedure for indemnification shall be
as follows:

(a) The Claimant, as the party claiming indemnification, shall give written
notice to the Indemnifier of any claim, whether between or among Parties or
brought by a Third Party,



56

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





within 20 days of receiving notice, or becoming aware, thereof and specifying
(i) the factual basis for such claim (to the extent known by the Claimant) and
(ii) if known, the amount of the claim; provided that failure to give such
notice within 20 days shall not constitute a defense to any claim for
indemnification unless, and only to the extent that, such failure materially
prejudices the Indemnifier except that the Indemnifier shall not be liable for
any expenses incurred during the period in which the Claimant failed to give
such notice. Thereafter, the Claimant shall deliver to the Indemnifier,
promptly following the Claimant's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Claimant relating to the
claim.

(b) Following receipt of notice from the Claimant of a claim, the Indemnifier
shall have 30 days to make such investigation of the claim as the Indemnifier
deems necessary or desirable. For the purposes of such investigation, the
Claimant agrees to make available to the Indemnifier and/or its authorized
representative(s) the information relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate
the claim. If the Claimant and the Indemnifier agree at or prior to the
expiration of said 30 day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof) to the validity and amount of such claim, the Indemnifier shall
immediately pay to the Claimant the full amount of the claim. If the Claimant
and the Indemnifier do not agree within such period (or any mutually agreed
upon extension thereof), the Claimant may seek a remedy in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement.

(c) With respect to any claim by a Third Party as to which a Claimant is
claiming indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifier shall have the right, at
its own expense, to participate in or assume control of the defense of such
claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifier, and the Claimant shall
cooperate fully with the Indemnifier, subject to reimbursement for actual out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the Claimant as the result of a request by the
Indemnifier. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifier's request) the provision to the Indemnifier of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party claim, and making
employees available at such times and places as may be reasonably necessary to
defend against such Third Party claim for the purpose of providing additional
information, explanation or testimony in connection with such Third Party
claim. If the Indemnifier elects to assume control of the defense of any Third
Party claim, the Indemnifier shall have the right to assert any counterclaims
or defenses available to Claimant against such Third Party, and the Claimant
shall have the right to participate in the defense of such claim at its own
expense and to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifier),
at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifier, it
being understood that the Indemnifier shall control such defense; provided
that if the Claimant shall have reasonably concluded that separate counsel is
required because a conflict of interest would otherwise exist, the Claimant
shall have the right to select separate counsel to participate in the defense
of such action on its behalf, at the expense of the Indemnifier. If the
Indemnifier does not elect to assume control or otherwise participate in the
defense of any Third Party claim, it shall be bound by the results obtained by
the Claimant with respect to such claim. If the Indemnifier assumes the
defense of a Third Party claim in accordance with this Section 11.5(c), the
Indemnifier shall not be liable to the Claimant for any legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Claimant in connection with the defense thereof.
Whether or not the Indemnifier assumes the defense of a Third Party claim, the
Claimant shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party claim without the Indemnifier's



57

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





prior written consent, and the Indemnifier shall not have any indemnification
obligation with respect to any settlement, compromise or discharge effected
without its prior written consent.

11.6 Limitations. The Indemnifier's obligations to indemnify the Claimant
pursuant to Section 11.3 or 11.4 shall be subject to the following
limitations:

(a) The Claimant shall be entitled to indemnification only for those Damages
arising with respect to any claim as to which Claimant has given the
Indemnifier written notice within the appropriate time period set forth in
Section 11.2 hereof for such claim.

(b) Claimant's Damages sought to be recovered under Section 11.3 or 11.4
hereof shall be net of any insurance proceeds actually received by Claimant
with respect to the events giving rise to such Damages. If the incurrence or
payment of any such Damages makes allowable to the Indemnified Party any
deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance (a "Tax
Benefit") which would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then the
indemnification payment to the Claimant under this Section 11 shall be an
amount equal to (i) the amount otherwise due but for this sentence, minus (ii)
the amount of Tax savings actually realized by the Claimant as a result of the
Tax Benefit in the Tax year in which the Damages were incurred (a "Tax
Savings"). If and to the extent that subsequent to any payment of Damages by
any Indemnifier to a Claimant hereunder, such Claimant receives insurance
proceeds or realizes a Tax Savings with respect to the events giving rise to
such Damages, which proceeds or Tax Savings would have been netted against
such Damages if they had been received prior to the Indemnifier's payment of
such Damages, then the Claimant shall remit such insurance proceeds or the
amount of such Tax Savings to Indemnifier to the extent such proceeds or
amount would have been netted against such Damages.

(c) ACS shall not be liable for indemnification under Section 11.3(a), 11.3(e)
or 11.3(g) (to the extent relating to Section 11.3(a) or 11.3(e)) (other than
with respect to claims for indemnification based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or other
willful misconduct, any breach of any covenant, or any pre-Closing liabilities
of the ACS Group that are not Assumed Liabilities (the "Basket/Cap
Exclusions")), until the aggregate amount of all indemnification payments for
which ACS is liable in respect of indemnification under such Sections (other
than with respect to claims for indemnification based upon the Basket/Cap
Exclusions) exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket"), in which event ACS shall be
required to pay all indemnification payments including the amount of the
Basket.

(d) The aggregate amount of all indemnification payments for which ACS shall
be liable pursuant to Section 11.3(a), 11.3(e) and 11.3(g) (to the extent
relating to Section 11.3(a) or 11.3(e)) (other than with respect to claims for
indemnification based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of
the Basket/Cap Exclusions) shall not exceed $50,000,000.

(e) The Parties agree that the amount of Damages attributable to a breach of
the representation contained in Section 4.5 that no Consent is required for
the assignment or transfer of any Postpaid Subscriber Contract shall be $350
multiplied by the number of Wireless lines with respect to such Postpaid
Subscriber Contract; provided, however, that the amount of such Damages shall
be $0 if (i) such Contract was listed on the Subscriber Contract Consent List
and a Non-



58

BUS_RE/5486564.1

* * *





Election Notice is not delivered by GCI with respect to such Postpaid
Subscriber Contract or (ii) such Contract is not terminated by the Subscriber
within six months after the Closing Date.

(f) No member of the ACS Group shall be liable for any Damages to GCI or any
of its Affiliates with respect to any loss or reduction in CETC Cash Flow if
ACS and its Affiliates have complied with their obligations with respect to
such CETC Cash Flow in this Agreement.

11.7 Taxes. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
Section 7.3 and the provisions of this Section 11, the provisions of Section
7.3 shall govern.

11.8 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnity payments made
pursuant to this Section 11 shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
adjustments to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements.

11.9 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Section 10.2, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that, following the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud on the
part of a Party hereto in connection with the Transactions) for any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
Section 7.3 or this Section 11\. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein it may have against the
other Parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective
representatives arising under or based upon any law, except pursuant to the
provisions set forth in Section 7.3 or this Section 11\. Nothing in this
Section 11.9 shall limit any Person's right to seek and obtain any equitable
relief to which any Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account
of any fraud.
