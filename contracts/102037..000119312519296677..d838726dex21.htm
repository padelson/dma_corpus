_provided_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer
shall not be required to disclose any information to the Sellers

commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections. Any such
objections that are resolved by Buyer and the Sellers Representative and any
portions of Buyers draft Closing Balance Sheet and draft calculation of the
Post-Closing Adjustments not disputed in the Sellers Representatives
Objection Statement shall be deemed to be final, binding and conclusive on
Buyer, Sellers and the Sellers Representative for purposes of preparing the
final, binding and conclusive Closing Balance Sheet and Post-Closing
Adjustments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(e)_. If a final resolution is not
obtained within 15 days after Buyer has received the Objection Statement, then
Buyer and the Sellers Representative will select Deloitte and Touche LLP (the "
_Independent Accountants_ ") to resolve any remaining objections. In the
event that Deloitte and Touche LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as the
Independent Accountants hereunder, then Buyer and the Sellers Representative
will select a nationally or regionally-recognized independent and neutral
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to each of them to serve as the
Independent Accountants. The Independent Accountants will act as an expert to
determine each disputed item (the amount of which may not be more favorable
to Buyer than the related amount reflected in Buyers draft calculation of the
Post-Closing Adjustments nor more favorable to Sellers than the related amount
set forth in the Objection Statement) and shall consider only those specific
items in dispute between Buyer and the Sellers Representative (and shall only
consider those items that are identified on the Objection Statement as in
dispute unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Sellers Representative),
and Buyer and the Sellers Representative will instruct the Independent
Accountants to endeavor to complete such process within a period of no more
than 30 days. Except

 



22

    

 as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_, the Independent Accountants
may conduct such proceedings as the Independent Accountants believe, in their
sole discretion, will assist in the determination of the disputed items;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as Buyer and the Sellers Representative
may otherwise agree, all communications between Buyer and the Sellers
Representative or any of their respective representatives, on the one hand,
and the Independent Accountants, on the other hand, will be in writing with
copies simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party. The
Independent Accountants determination shall be made solely in accordance
with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement and based solely on
the submissions and supporting materials provided by Buyer and the Sellers
Representative in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this
Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review of outside
materials). The Independent Accountants determination of the disputed items
will be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable (barring manifest
error) on Buyer, Sellers and the Sellers Representative for purposes of
preparing the final, binding and conclusive Closing Balance Sheet and Post-
Closing Adjustments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(e)_, effective as of the
date the Independent Accountants written determination is received by Buyer
and the Sellers Representative.

 

(e) Buyer will revise the draft Closing Balance Sheet and draft calculation
of the Post-Closing Adjustments as appropriate to reflect the resolution of
the Sellers Representatives objections (as agreed upon by Buyer and the
Sellers Representative or as determined by the Independent Accountants)
promptly but in no event later than five Business Days after the resolution
of such objections. Such revised statements shall be the final, binding and
conclusive Closing Balance Sheet and Post-Closing Adjustments, respectively,
for purposes of calculating any Closing Payment Decrease or Closing Payment
Increase pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(f)_.

(f) Subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 2.5(f)_, in the
event that (i) the Preliminary Net Working Capital, _plus_ the estimated
Company Cash outstanding as of the Effective Time exceeds (ii) an amount equal
to the Final Net Working Capital, _plus_ the Company Cash outstanding as of
the Effective Time, _less_ the amount, if any, of Indebtedness outstanding at
Closing after the payment made as of the Effective Time pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.4(c)_,  _less_ the amount, if any, of Transaction Expenses
outstanding as of the Effective Time after the payment made at Closing
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_, then the Closing Payment shall be
decreased by the amount of such excess (a " _Closing Payment Decrease_ "),
and the amount of such Closing Payment Decrease shall be deducted from the
Working Capital Escrow Amount, and the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall
instruct the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the procedures in the Escrow
Agreement, to (x) promptly release an amount equal to the lesser of the
Closing Payment Decrease and the Working Capital Escrow Amount to Buyer by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
writing by Buyer, and (y) promptly release the amount, if any, by which the
Working Capital Escrow Amount exceeds the Closing Payment Decrease to Sellers,
based on their Percentage Interest of such excess, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated for each Seller in the
Flow of Funds. If the Closing Payment Decrease exceeds the Working Capital
Escrow Amount, then the amount in excess of the Working Capital Escrow Amount
shall be paid by Sellers to Buyer by each Seller paying, within five Business
Days of the determination of the Closing Payment Decrease, an amount equal to
such Sellers Percentage Interest of the Closing Payment Decrease to Buyer by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in
writing by Buyer. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _
2.5(f)_, in the event that (A) an amount equal to the Final 

 



23

    

 Net Working Capital, _plus_ the Company Cash outstanding as of the Effective
Time, _less_ the amount, if any, of Indebtedness outstanding as of the
Effective Time after the payment made at Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_, _less_ the amount, if any, of Transaction Expenses outstanding as of
the Effective Time after the payment made at Closing pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.4(d)_ exceeds (B) the Preliminary Net Working Capital, _plus_ the
estimated Company Cash outstanding as of the Effective Time, then the Closing
Payment shall be increased by the amount of such excess (a " _Closing

Increase or Closing Payment Decrease under the terms of this _Section_ __ _
2.5(f)_ as a result thereof, the Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be due to
Sellers, and the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow
Agent, in accordance with the procedures in the Escrow Agreement, to promptly
release the Working Capital Escrow Amount to Sellers, based on their

(g) If any unresolved objections are submitted to the Independent
Accountants for resolution as provided above, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, will share the fees and expenses of such
accounting firm in proportion to the degree to which the final Closing
Payment, as determined by the Independent Accountants, differs from the
proposed final Closing Payment set forth in the statement of Post-Closing
Adjustments and Objections Statement submitted by Buyer and the Sellers
Representative, respectively, such that the Party whose calculation of the
Closing Payment differs more from the calculation submitted by the Independent
Accountants shall pay proportionately more of the costs and expenses of the
Independent Accountants.

 

(h) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, (i) the Closing Balance
Sheet and (ii) the Final Net Working Capital, shall each be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, and consistent with the example calculation of Net
Working Capital set forth on _Schedule 2.5_.

 

(i) Neither the Closing Balance Sheet nor the Post-Closing Adjustments
shall be deemed to limit any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties hereunder (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
those set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1)_. Notwithstanding any provision set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the

(j) The Parties hereto agree that any adjustment as determined pursuant to

Section 2.6 _Earnout_.

 

(a) As additional consideration for the purchase of the Shares, Buyer shall
make payments to Sellers based on the Pro Forma Gross Profit, calculated in
accordance with _Schedule 2.6_ (each such payment, an " _Earnout Payment_ "
and collectively, the " _Earnout Payments_ "), in the amount, if any, and in
the manner as may be determined to be payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.6_ during the following periods (each such period, an " _Earnout Period_ "):
(i) the 12-months ending December 31, 2020 and (ii) the 12-months ending
December 31, 2021.

(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 60 days after the
end of each Earnout Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers
Representative a statement (the " _Preliminary Earnout Statement_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail Buyers good faith calculation of the Pro Forma
Gross Profit and the applicable Earnout Payment owed to Sellers for such
Earnout Period, together with reasonable supporting detail and documentation.
The Preliminary Earnout Statement will be prepared in good faith by Buyer
based on the calculations set forth on _Schedule 1.1(d)_ and _Schedule 2.6_ ,
in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(c) Within five Business Days after Buyer and the Sellers Representative
determine that the Earnout Payment amount is final pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.6(d)_, Buyer shall pay such Earnout Payment to Sellers Representative by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank designated by him. Each
Seller will receive from the Sellers Representative such Sellers Percentage
Interest of such Earnout Payment.

(d) The Sellers Representative may, within 30 days after the date of
receipt each Preliminary Earnout Statement, deliver to Buyer a notice setting
forth in reasonable detail with supporting documentation any objections that
Sellers, in good faith, may have thereto (such notice, a " _Earnout Objection
Notice_ "). If the Sellers Representative does not so object within such time
period, the calculation of the Pro Forma Gross Profit and the Earnout Payment
set forth in such Preliminary Earnout Statement will be final and binding on
the parties for purposes of this Agreement. If the Sellers Representative so
objects in good faith and delivers an Earnout Objection Notice within such
time period, then he and Buyer will use good faith efforts to resolve by
written agreement any differences as to the calculation of Pro Forma Gross
Profit and, if he and Buyer so resolve any such differences, the Pro Forma
Gross Profit, as adjusted by the agreed adjustments, will be final
and binding on the parties for purposes of this Agreement. If any objections
raised by the Sellers Representative are not resolved by written agreement of
the parties within 15 Business Days after he advises Buyer of Sellers
objections, then he, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer, will submit the
objections that are then unresolved to the Independent Accountants, which
shall be directed to resolve the unresolved objections as promptly as
reasonably practicable and to deliver written notice to each of Buyer and the
Sellers Representative setting forth its resolution of the disputed matters.
All determinations by the Independent Accountants will be based solely on the
information presented to it by Buyer or the Sellers Representative and their
respective representatives, and not by independent review. In resolving any
disputed item, the Independent Accountants will be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, including the definition 

 



25

    

 of Pro Forma Gross Profit, and will not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The calculation of Pro
Forma Gross Profit and the Earnout Payment, after giving effect to any agreed
adjustments and the resolution of any disputed matters by the Independent
Accountants, will be final and binding on the parties for purposes of this
Agreement. If any unresolved objections are submitted to the Independent
Accountants for resolution as provided above, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, will share the fees and expenses of such
accounting firm in proportion to the degree to which the applicable final
Earnout Payment, as determined by the Independent Accountants, differs from
the applicable proposed final Earnout Payment set forth in the Preliminary
Earnout Statement submitted by Buyer and the Earnout Objection Notice
submitted by the Sellers Representative, respectively, such that the Party
whose calculation of the applicable Earnout Payment differs more from the
calculation submitted by the Independent Accountants shall
pay proportionately more of the costs and expenses of the Independent
Accountants.

(e) During the period set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.6(d)_, the Sellers
Representative and his representatives (i) will be permitted to review, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice and with Buyers cooperation,
the Companys Books and Records to the extent related to the preparation of
the Preliminary Earnout Statement, including any work papers and memoranda
which have been provided to Buyer or the Company, and (ii) will be given
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
knowledgeable Employees and accounting professionals of the Company and Buyer
to the extent reasonably necessary to facilitate the Sellers Representatives
review of the Preliminary Earnout Statement, to the extent reasonably
requested by the Sellers Representative; _provided_ , notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to
disclose any information to the Sellers Representative or
his representatives if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to (x)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (y) contravene any
Applicable Law or any confidentiality agreement.

 

(f) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, Sellers
acknowledge, understand and agree that (i) Buyer shall have the right to
operate the Company and the Business in the sole discretion of Buyer and make
all decisions with respect to the Company and the Business in its sole
discretion; (ii) the amount of the Earnout Payments contemplated herein is
speculative and is subject to numerous factors outside the control of Buyer
and the Company; (iii) neither Buyer nor the Company has promised or projected
payment of the Earnout Payments; (iv) neither Buyer nor the Company owe a
fiduciary duty or express or implied duty to Sellers; (v) the contingent right
of Sellers to receive Earnout Payments is not an investment in Buyer or the
Company, and the contingent right shall not entitle Sellers to any rights as
shareholders of Buyer or the Company; (vi) the parties solely intend the
express provisions of this Agreement to govern all of their rights and
obligations, if any, with respect to the Earnout Payments contemplated
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_; and (vii) nothing herein will
prohibit Buyer or the Company from engaging in any business or opportunity or
acquiring, entering into joint ventures, investing in or otherwise cooperating

such plan (or an application for a determination letter is currently pending),
(ii) such plan has been amended on a timely basis to comply with applicable
requirements of the Code and (iii) no facts or circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect such plans qualification under
Section 401(a) and related sections of the Code or the unavailability of
reliance on such determination or advisory letter from the IRS.

(e) No Employee Benefit Plan is, and neither now, nor in the past six
years has, the Company or any ERISA Affiliates maintained, participated in,
contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to, or had any actual or
contingent Liability to (i) an employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA; (ii) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA); (iii) a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in 29 C.F.R. Section
4001.2) or a plan subject to Section 413(c) of the Code, (iv) a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA or
applicable state law), or (v) a "voluntary employees beneficiary association"
(as defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the Code) or other funded arrangement for
the provision of welfare benefits. No Employee Benefit Plan holds any employer
security (within the meaning of Section 407(d)(1) of ERISA) or employer real
property (within the meaning of Section 407(d)(2) of ERISA), and no
commitment has been made that could require any Employee Benefit Plan to hold
any such employer security or employer real property. No Employee Benefit Plan
providing medical or welfare benefits is self-insured by the Company
(including any plan pursuant to which a stop loss policy or contract applies).

 

(f) The Company and Sellers have not, and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no
other Person has, engaged in any transaction with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan that could subject the Company to any Taxes or penalty (civil or
otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Applicable Law.

 

(g) No Employee Benefit Plan provides health care or other welfare benefits
(through insurance or otherwise), or for the continuation of such benefits or
coverage, in any case, after retirement or other termination of employment,
except for continuation coverage as required

 



53

    

 by COBRA, and then only to the extent that the former employee and, if
applicable, dependent pays the "applicable premium" as defined in COBRA. The
requirements of COBRA and any applicable state insurance Laws have been met
with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan.

 

(h) Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.25(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents will not (either alone or together with any other event) (i) entitle
any individual to any bonus, severance, retirement, termination, retention,
change in control or other benefits or compensation (except as set forth
herein), (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger or require
any payment funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits, (iii) increase the amount payable or give rise to any other
obligation pursuant to any Employee Benefit Plan, (iv) prohibit any Employee
Benefit Plan from being amended or terminated, or (v) result in, or
be characterized as, an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. There is no obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or
otherwise "gross-up" any Person for the Tax set forth under Section 409A or
Section 4999 of the Code.

(i) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan (as defined in Section 409A(d)(l) of the Code) is, and since
July 1, 2016, has been in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, and no
participant in such an Employee Benefit Plan has become subject to the Tax
imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code, and there is no obligation to
reimburse, indemnify, or otherwise "gross-up" any person for the interest or
additional Tax set forth under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

(j) Each such Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes a "group health plan"
has been operated and administered in compliance with the Affordable Care Act
and the applicable regulations and guidance thereunder. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate owes any Taxes imposed by Code Section 4980H. Neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, and no condition exists with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to
subject any of them to, any Tax, fine, interest or penalty or other Liability
imposed by the Affordable Care Act.

and any other applicable Antitrust Law. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of any substantive communication
it or any of its representatives receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the
other Parties to review in advance any proposed substantive communication by
such Party to any Governmental Authority. Each of the Parties shall permit
outside counsel of the other Party to be present or participate in any

Parties in advance and gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such call, discussion or meeting. Each Party hereto shall, and
shall cause its representatives to, coordinate and cooperate fully with each
other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other Party hereto may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and

shall, and shall cause its outside counsel to, provide each other with copies
of all correspondence, filings (excluding Buyers HSR Act Form documentation
or similar documentation submitted to Governmental Authorities under the
Antitrust Laws) or communications between them or any of their respective
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members
of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the

opportunity for review and comment thereon, copies of any material written
communication to a Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law relating to

other hand, prior notice of the meeting and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate and
(v) consult and cooperate with one another in good faith in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party hereto
relating to Proceedings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Sellers and
Buyer may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section_
__ _ 5.5_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors, managers, or shareholders of the recipient, or to
anyone else, unless express written permission (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Sellers, the Company or Buyer, as the case may be).

(d) Buyer and each Seller shall use (and Sellers shall cause the Company
to use) commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws. In connection therewith, if any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as in violation of any Antitrust Law, Buyer and each Seller shall cooperate
and use (and Sellers shall cause the Company to cooperate and use)
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist every such Proceeding.
For the avoidance of doubt, "commercially reasonable efforts" under this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ shall not impose upon Buyer any obligation to agree to
effect (i) the sale, divestiture, disposition, licensing, or holding separate
of one or more businesses, product or service lines or assets of Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Company or (ii) any limitations on Buyers freedom of action
with respect to one or more businesses, product or service lines, or assets of
Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company. The Parties hereby agree to request
early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, and to pursue
similar relief from the waiting periods imposed by Governmental Authorities
under the Antitrust Laws where reasonably available.

 

(e) Sellers will be responsible for, and will pay, any amounts required to
be paid in connection with obtaining any Required Consent, _provided,
however_ , that Buyer will be responsible for, and will pay, any amounts to be
paid in connection with obtaining any new Permits, obtaining any third party
Consent that is not a Required Consent, or in connection with any amendments,
extensions, new contracts, or other special or additional requests proposed or
required by Buyer that are not necessary or required by the terms of the
pertinent Contract or Permit in connection with obtaining any third
party Consent, other than in connection with any filings to be made or
actions to be taken pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_.

any action that would knowingly render any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be inaccurate in any material respect as of the
Closing. Buyer and each Seller shall promptly notify the other of any
development that they become aware of that would cause any of the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ on the Closing Date not to be satisfied. No such
notification (or failure to provide such notification) shall be given any
effect for purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and
warranties made by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, determining whether the

affect any right or remedy of Buyer under this Agreement, including for
purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement.

the cost of the DandO and EPL Tail Policy, and such costs, to the extent not
paid prior to the Closing, shall be included in the determination of
Liabilities of the Company as of the Effective Time. During the term of the
DandO and EPL Tail Policy, Buyer shall not (and shall cause the Company not to)
take any action following the Closing to cause the DandO and EPL Tail Policy to

Section 8.3 _Buyer Indemnification Procedure; Limitations on
Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Buyer Indemnified Parties may assert a claim for indemnification
against a Seller or Sellers for any matter not involving a third-party claim
that is covered by the indemnity provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and
subject to the limitations on recovery pursuant to this _Article VIII_ by
giving prompt written notice to the Sellers Representative specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such claim, along with the estimated amount
(if reasonably estimable) of the Losses related to such claim; _provided_ ,
that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve any Seller of his
obligations hereunder except to the extent such Seller is actually prejudiced
by such failure or such notice was not delivered during the applicable time
period to assert a claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. The Sellers
Representative, on behalf of Sellers, shall have the right to contest such
claim by giving written notice to the Buyer Indemnified Party specifying in
reasonable detail the basis of any objection to the Buyer Indemnified
Partys claim within 30 days of the receipt of the Buyer Indemnified Partys
written notice. If Sellers Representative contests any such claim, then
either the Buyer Indemnified Party or the Sellers Representative may submit
such dispute to the Chosen Court for resolution in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 11.3_; _provided_ , that the foregoing sentence shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any Buyer Indemnified Partys right to submit any
dispute to the Chosen Court prior to the expiration of such 30-day period to
the extent necessary to comply with any statute of limitations applicable in
respect of the underlying claim for indemnification or in any way limit
Buyers ability to pursue a claim pursuant to the RandW Policy.

(b) In the event a third-party claim against a Buyer Indemnified Party
arises that is covered by the indemnity provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and
subject to the limitations on recovery pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ,
written notice shall be given promptly by the Buyer Indemnified Party to the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers, specifying in reasonable detail
the basis for such claim, along with the estimated amount (if reasonably
estimable) of the Losses related to such claim; _provided_ , that the failure
to give such notice shall not relieve any Seller of his obligations hereunder
except to the extent such Seller is actually prejudiced by such failure or
such notice was not delivered during the applicable time period to assert a
claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. The Sellers Representative, on behalf
of Sellers, shall have the right to contest such indemnification claim or to
control the defense of all appropriate legal proceedings in respect of

 



76

    

 the underlying third-party claim with lead counsel of his choosing (at the
sole cost and expense of Sellers) by giving written notice to the Buyer
Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of the Buyer Indemnified
Partys written notice, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of any
objection to the Buyer Indemnified Partys claim and whether the Sellers
Representative has elected to exercise the right to control the defense of
any related legal proceedings (a " _Seller Objection Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall be entitled to control any such legal proceeding
if: (i) the third-party claim seeks an attachment, temporary restraining
order, injunction, specific performance or other non-monetary relief; (ii) the
third-party claim is or relates to a criminal Proceeding or a Proceeding
brought by a Governmental Authority, or could reasonably be determined to be
materially detrimental to or injure the Buyer Indemnified Partys or any of
its Affiliates reputation, Customer or vendor relations or future business
prospects; (iii) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict of interest on any significant issue related to such proceeding
exists between Sellers and the Buyer Indemnified Party, as reasonably
determined on the advice of counsel; or (iv) the Sellers Representative
(after the expiration of such 30-day period) failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend such legal proceedings (in which case the
Sellers Representative shall surrender control to the Buyer Indemnified
Party upon notice thereof from the Buyer Indemnified Party). In the event the
Sellers Representative exercises his right to control such legal proceedings,
the Sellers Representative also shall control all settlements of such legal
proceedings at the sole cost and expense of Sellers subject to the limitations
on recovery pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers, may not affect any
settlement that could result in any cost, expense or Liability to a Buyer
Indemnified Party unless the Buyer Indemnified Party consents in writing to
such settlement, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld (it being
understood and agreed that any consent so withheld shall not be deemed
unreasonable if the settlement (y) could result in injunctive or other
equitable relief or monetary damages in excess of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (less any other claimed amounts) or (z) involves any admission of
wrongdoing on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Party). The Buyer Indemnified
Party may select counsel to participate in any defense controlled by the
Sellers Representative, in which event any fees or expenses of the Buyer
Indemnified Partys counsel that accrue after the receipt of the applicable
Seller Objection Notice shall be at the Buyer Indemnified Partys own cost and
expense. In connection with any such claim, action or proceeding, the Parties
shall cooperate with each other in good faith. Notwithstanding the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, if the Sellers Representative is not
permitted to or does not elect to assume control of such defense, then the
Buyer Indemnified Party may assume control of the defense in connection with
such third-party claim with counsel of its choosing, and the reasonable
documented fees, charges and expenses of such counsel shall be reimbursed by
Sellers subject to the limitations on recovery pursuant to this _Article VIII_
; _provided_ , _however_ , that the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party may not
affect any settlement that could result in any relief from Sellers other than
monetary damages equal to or less than the Cap (to the extent applicable)
unless the Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers, consents in writing
to such settlement, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld (it being
understood and agreed that any consent so withheld shall not be deemed
unreasonable if the settlement would result in injunctive or other equitable
relief or monetary damages in excess of the Cap (to the extent applicable) or
involves any admission of criminal wrongdoing by any Seller). If there shall
be any conflicts between the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.12_ (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 8.12_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

 



77

    

(c) Claims against Sellers for which indemnification is sought under 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be subject to the following limitations on
recovery:

(i) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.2(g)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Losses for
which indemnification is sought by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_ exceeds the Deductible, in
which event any such Losses exceeding the Deductible shall be subject to
indemnification (and Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any such Losses in amounts up to an amount equal to
the Deductible); _provided, however_ , that the Deductible will not apply in
the event of fraud or in the event of Losses caused by breaches or
inaccuracies of any Fundamental Representation, or any representation and
warranty that is an Excluded Claim under the RandW Policy.

 

(ii) Additionally, Sellers aggregate liability to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not exceed $5,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") for Losses, not including
any amounts recovered under the RandW Policy; _provided, however_ , that the Cap
will not apply with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of any Fundamental
Representations, claims pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ through
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(f)_ ( _other than_ claims pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(e)_ (Excluded Liabilities) solely with respect to Known Proceedings,
Known Environmental Liabilities, or Known Product Liabilities, which will be
subject to the Cap), or in the event of fraud, and the amount of Losses with
respect to such claims will not be considered in determining whether the Cap
has been met;  _provided further, however_ , that the Cap will apply with
respect to Excluded Claims (other than with respect to claims related to
Fundamental Representations) and the amount of Losses with respect to Excluded
Claims (other than with respect to claims related to Fundamental
Representations) will be considered in determining whether the Cap has been
met. In addition, the maximum liability for all Losses for which
indemnification is sought under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not exceed, in the
aggregate, the Purchase Price, other than for fraud.

(d) Recovery for Losses under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ through _Section_
__ _ 8.2(g)_ shall come first from the Indemnification Escrow Amount in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement until the
Indemnification Escrow Amount has been fully depleted or disbursed from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund. If such Losses exceed the amount available in the
Indemnification Escrow Fund, the Buyer Indemnified Parties may recover
directly from Sellers, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.3(c)(ii)_, as applicable.

(e) The following order of priority shall apply for the recovery of Losses
against Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_:

 

(i) _first_ , following, for the avoidance of doubt the application of the
Deductible to such Losses (to the extent applicable), the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall recover Losses from the amounts then remaining in the RandW
Retention Escrow Fund to the extent the Losses are not Excluded Claims, until
the cumulative amount of such Losses recovered has reached the RandW Retention
Escrow Amount;

 



78

    

(ii) _second_ , if the amount of Losses has exceeded the RandW Retention
Escrow Amount, and to the extent the Losses are not Excluded Claims, then by
collecting insurance proceeds from the RandW Policy;

 

(iii) _third_ , if the Losses or any portion thereof are Excluded Claims
under the RandW Policy and/or relate to breaches or inaccuracies of Fundamental
Representations hereunder _after_ application of the insurance proceeds from
the RandW Policy (as applicable), then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
recover such Losses from the amounts then remaining in the Indemnification
Escrow Fund until the cumulative amount of such Losses recovered has depleted
the Indemnification Escrow Fund; and

 

(iv) _fourth_ , if the Losses or any portion thereof are Excluded Claims
under the RandW Policy and/or relate to breaches or inaccuracies of Fundamental
Representations hereunder _after_ application of the insurance proceeds from
the RandW Policy (as applicable), and the amount of Losses has depleted the
Indemnification Escrow Fund, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall recover
such Losses from Sellers, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section_ __
_ 8.3(c)(ii)_, as applicable.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.3(e)(iii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)(iv)_, the RandW Retention Escrow Amount
and the RandW Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against Sellers for
breaches of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __
_ 8.2(a)_, except in the case of fraud. In addition, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recover Losses from the Sellers if such
Losses would have been covered under the RandW Policy, and such coverage for
such Losses was denied under the RandW Policy solely to the extent that a Buyer
Indemnified Party failed to properly make a claim thereunder or to otherwise
comply with the terms thereof, so long as such failure to properly make a
claim or otherwise comply with the terms of the RandW Policy is not caused by
Sellers fraud.

Section 8.4 _Indemnification of Sellers by Buyer_. Subject to
the limitations and procedures in this _Article VIII_ , from and after the
Effective Time, Buyer and the Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold
Sellers (together with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") harmless from and against, and agrees to defend promptly Sellers
from and reimburse Sellers for, any and all Losses that Sellers may at any
time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in connection
with:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement; and

 

(b) any failure of Buyer to carry out, perform, satisfy or discharge any of
its covenants, agreements, undertakings, Liabilities or obligations under
this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any other documents or
certificates delivered on the part of itself in connection with this
Agreement.

 

Section 8.5 _Sellers Indemnification Procedure; Limitation on Liability_.

 

(a) Sellers may assert a claim for indemnification against Buyer for any
matter not involving a third-party claim that is covered by the indemnity
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ by giving prompt written notice to Buyer
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such claim,

 



79

    

 along with the estimated amount (if reasonably estimable) of the Losses
related to such claim; _provided_ , that the failure to give such notice shall
not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder except to the extent Buyer is
actually prejudiced by such failure or such notice was not delivered during
the applicable time period to assert a claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.
Buyer shall have the right to contest such claim by giving written notice to
the Sellers Representative, on behalf of such Seller, specifying in
reasonable detail the basis of any objection to such Sellers claim within 30
days of the receipt of such Sellers written notice. If Buyer contests such
claim, then either the Sellers Representative or Buyer may submit such
dispute to the Chosen Court for resolution in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.3_; _provided_ , that the foregoing sentence shall not be deemed to limit
or otherwise affect the Sellers Representatives right to submit any dispute
to the Chosen Court prior to the expiration of such 30-day period to the
extent necessary to comply with any statute of limitations applicable in
respect of the underlying claim for indemnification.

 

(b) In the event a third-party claim against a Seller arises that is
covered by the indemnity provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ and subject to
the limitations on recovery pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , written notice
shall be given promptly by the Sellers Representative, on behalf of such
Seller, to Buyer specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such claim,
along with the estimated amount (if reasonably estimable) of the Losses
related to such claim; _provided_ that the failure to give such notice shall
not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder except to the extent Buyer is
actually prejudiced by such failure or such notice was not delivered during
the applicable time period to assert a claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.
Buyer shall have the right to contest such indemnification claim or to
control the defense of all appropriate legal proceedings in respect of the
underlying third-party claim with lead counsel of its choosing (at the sole
cost and expense of Buyer) by giving written notice to the Sellers
Representative within 30 days of the receipt of the Sellers Representatives
written notice on behalf of such Seller, specifying in reasonable detail the
basis of any objection to such Sellers claim and whether Buyer has elected
to exercise the right to control the defense of any related legal proceedings
(a " _Buyer Objection Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of Sellers, shall be entitled to control any such
legal proceeding if: (i) the third-party claim seeks an attachment, temporary
restraining order, injunction, specific performance or other non-monetary
relief; (ii) the third-party claim is or relates to a criminal Proceeding or
a Proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority, or could reasonably be
determined to be detrimental to or injure a Sellers reputation or future
business prospects; (iii) under applicable standards of professional conduct,
a conflict of interest on any significant issue related to such proceeding
exists between Sellers and Buyer, as reasonably determined on the advice of
counsel; or (iv) Buyer failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such legal proceedings (in which case Buyer shall surrender control to the
Sellers Representative upon request of the Sellers Representative). In the
event Buyer exercises its right to control such legal proceedings, Buyer
shall also control all settlements of such legal proceedings at the sole cost
and expense of Buyer subject to the limitations on recovery pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may not effect any
settlement that could result in any cost, expense or Liability to Sellers
unless the Sellers Representative, on behalf of such Seller, consents in
writing to such settlement, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
(it being understood and agreed that any consent so withheld shall not be
deemed unreasonable if the settlement (y) could result in injunctive or other
equitable relief or (z) involves any admission of wrongdoing on behalf of a
Seller). The Sellers Representative, on behalf of such Seller, may select
counsel to participate in any defense controlled by Buyer, in which event any
fees or expenses of such Sellers counsel that accrue after the receipt of the
applicable Buyer Objection Notice shall be at Sellers

 



80

    

 own cost and expense. In connection with any such claim, action or
proceeding, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, if Buyer is
not permitted or does not elect to assume control of such defense then the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of such Seller, may assume control of the
defense in connection with such third-party claim with counsel of its
choosing, and the reasonable documented fees, charges and expenses of such
counsel shall be reimbursed by Buyer subject to the limitations on recovery
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the applicable Seller, may not effect any
settlement that could result in any cost, expense or Liability to Buyer or the
Company unless Buyer consents in writing to such settlement, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood and agreed that any
consent so withheld shall not be deemed unreasonable if the settlement would
result in injunctive or other equitable relief or involves any admission
of criminal wrongdoing by Buyer). If there shall be any conflicts between the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ (relating
to Tax contests), the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ shall control with
respect to Tax contests.

(c) Buyer shall not be required to indemnify Sellers pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.4(a)_ (other than with respect to breaches or inaccuracies of any
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 4.2_) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses for
which indemnification is sought by Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_
first exceeds the Deductible, in which event any Losses exceeding the
Deductible shall be subject to indemnification (and Buyer shall not be
obligated to indemnify any Seller for any Losses in amounts up to an amount
equal to the Deductible). Additionally, Buyers aggregate liability to
Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall not
exceed the Purchase Price other than for fraud.

 

Section 8.6 _Additional Indemnification Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of determining whether there has been any breach of a
representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining the amount of
Losses resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in any
representation or warranty or the definition of any defined term used therein
relating to or referring to the terms "material", "materiality", "in all
material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase
shall be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that for
purposes of determining liability under  _Article VIII_ , the representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if
such terms and phrases were not included in them, other than any
representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in _Article III_ that are
Excluded Claims.

(b) The amount of any Loss or Tax subject to indemnification or
reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement shall be net of any amounts actually
received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under insurance policies
(including the DandO and EPL Tail Policy, title insurance policy, and the RandW
Policy (subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_); _provided_
that the existence of the RandW Policy, the DandO and EPL Tail Policy, and the
title insurance policy, or any claims related thereto shall not in any way
limit any Buyer Indemnified Partys ability to recover from Sellers in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, indemnities, reimbursement
arrangements or Contracts (including with respect to any breaches thereof)
pursuant to which or under which such Person or such Persons Affiliates is a
party or has rights with respect to such Loss, in each case, net of the
reasonable expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in
procuring such recovery, including insurance deductibles and any reasonably

 



81

    

 foreseeable premium increases. Sellers acknowledge that Buyer and its
Affiliates maintain insurance policies with self-insured retentions and/or
large deductibles and that payments made or amounts retained by Buyer or its
Affiliates towards satisfying any self-insured retentions, deductibles, or
similar thresholds shall not constitute an actual receipt of insurance
proceeds. Any Loss under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise
to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement, and will be without duplication of any recovery
received under any other agreement or cause of action between Sellers or
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or the post-Closing Company, on
the other hand.

 

(c) Any payment pursuant to a claim for indemnification not covered by the
RandW Policy shall be made not later than 30 days after receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of written notice from the Indemnified Party stating the
amount of the claim, unless the claim is subject to defense as provided in
this Agreement, in which case payment shall be made not later than 30 days
after the amount of the claim is finally determined or any such dispute is
resolved.

(d) Each Party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses; _provided_ , that an
Indemnified Party shall not be required to seek recovery from an insurance
carrier or other Person with respect to any matter that is the subject of a
claim for indemnification under this _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent a Loss was taken
into account in determining the Purchase Price, no Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to any indemnification for such Loss.

 

Section 8.7 _Knowledge of Breach_. The right of any Party to
indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy under this Agreement shall not
be affected by any investigation (including any environmental investigation or
assessment) conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before, on or after the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement
or otherwise with respect to the transactions set forth in this Agreement,
except solely to the extent that such Party had actual knowledge prior to the
execution of this Agreement and such inaccuracy or noncompliance would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and the other Party
had no knowledge of such inaccuracy or noncompliance.

Section 8.8 _Limit on Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Agreement, Losses shall be limited to breach of contract damages
(other than with respect to fraud, breaches of _Article IX_ (Restricted
Covenants), or in connection with exercising specific performance pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 11.11_), no Party shall be liable for any special
damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, damages
associated with lost profits or opportunities (including loss of future
revenue, income or profits, diminution of value or loss of business
reputation) or damages that are not the direct or natural, probable and
reasonably foreseeable consequence of the event giving rise to the damages,
except, in each case, to the extent payable to a third party in respect of a
third party claim or due to such Partys fraud.

Section 8.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, the
indemnification rights set forth in this _Article VIII_ shall constitute the
exclusive monetary remedy for any breach of any

 



82

    

 representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, undertaking, Liability or
obligation under this Agreement by Buyer or Sellers. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall operate to limit the
liability of Sellers or Buyer for fraud, willful breach or intentional
misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no limitations (including any survival limitations and other limitations set
forth in this _Article VIII_ ), qualifications or procedures in this Agreement
shall be deemed to limit or modify the ability of Buyer to make claims under
or recover under the RandW Policy; it being understood that any matter for
which there is coverage available under the RandW Policy shall be subject to
the terms, conditions and limitations, if any, set forth in the RandW Policy.

 

Section 8.10 _Additional Instruments_. At any time and from time to time
after the Closing, at a Partys request and without further consideration,
each other Party, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation and
take such other action as such Party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable in order to more effectively consummate the transactions described
in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.11 _Right to Set Off_. The Indemnified Parties, and any
Affiliates thereof, shall have the right to set off any Losses finally
determined to be due from an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_
against any payments to be made by such Party, or any Affiliate of such
Indemnifying Party, pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement between
the Parties hereto, including any Transaction Document.

Section 8.12 _Tax Matters_. 

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. Except to the extent treated as a Liability in
the calculation of Indebtedness or Final Net Working Capital and resulting in
a reduction to the Purchase Price, Sellers shall indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and hold them harmless from and against, without
duplication, all Losses resulting from or attributable to (i) any and all
Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the Company, its Affiliates, and FSRA for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on
the Company, its Affiliates, or FSRA as a transferee or successor, by
Contract (other than any Commercial Tax Agreement) or pursuant to any Law or
otherwise, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing, (iii) any Taxes for which the Company, its Affiliates or FSRA is
liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law as a result of having been a member
of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group before the Closing,
(iv) any Transfer Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to
Section 8.12(b), (v) any Taxes attributable to the dissolution of FSRA, and
(vi) any and all employment, payroll and withholding Taxes imposed on the
Buyer or the Company, any of its Affiliates, or FSRA with respect to payments
made to employees pursuant to this Agreement that are attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Periods. For the avoidance of doubt, recovery hereunder will be
without duplication of any amounts received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, recording, registration, controlling interest transfer and other
similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest), if any (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ "), incurred in connection with the sale of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne 100% by Sellers. The Parties shall
remit the payment

 



83

    

 for all of the Transfer Taxes and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
and other documentation required to be filed with respect to any such Transfer
Taxes, if any. Buyer and Sellers shall join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation to the extent required by Applicable Law. The
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to take such commercially reasonable
actions as will minimize or reduce the amount of such Transfer Taxes.

(c) _Tax Return Preparation_. Buyer shall prepare and file all Tax Returns
of the Company that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and that
relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. Buyer shall prepare
such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practices (unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law). With respect to any Tax Returns of the Company
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, Buyer shall send Sellers
Representative a copy of each such Tax Return (together with such schedules
and supporting work papers as Sellers Representative may reasonably request)
for his review at least 30 days (15 days with respect to non-Income Tax
Returns) prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall cooperate in good faith in resolving any outstanding
disputes regarding any such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence,
and shall resolve any such disputes prior to the due date of such a Tax
Return. For the avoidance of doubt, any deductions attributable to expenses
described in _clause (ii)_ of the definition of Transaction Expenses or in
the definition of Transaction Bonuses shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. Except to the extent
treated as a Liability in the calculation of Indebtedness or Final Net Working
Capital and resulting in a Purchase Price reduction, Sellers shall pay to
Buyer its allocable share of any Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period no later than five days before the due date for the Tax Return
for such Taxes. 

(d) _Straddle Period Taxes_. For all purposes of this Agreement, the
portion of any Tax with respect to any Straddle Period that is allocable to
the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period will be determined as follows:
(i) in the case of any sales or use Tax, value added Tax, employment Tax,
withholding Tax, and any Tax based on or measured by income, profits, or
receipts shall be determined based on the amount of Taxes that would be
payable based on a closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date, and
(ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined based on the amount of such
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the applicable
Straddle Period; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (or on a monthly basis, where required) shall be
allocated between the period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
period beginning after the Closing Date (or with respect to federal income
taxes in proportion to the number of days in each period); _and provided
further_ that, if any property Taxes that would normally be payable in
and for a period after the Closing Date are accelerated to the period in
which the Closing Date shall occur, such Taxes shall be treated under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.12(d)_ as Taxes for a Straddle Period.

 

(e) _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the
Company (including corresponding amounts credited against the Tax to which
Buyer or the Company become entitled), that (x) relate to a Tax period ending
prior to the Closing Date and (y) were for Taxes paid by the Company prior to
the Closing or by Sellers after the Closing Date, shall be for the account of
Sellers, and Buyer shall pay over to Sellers any such refund or the amount of
any such credit (net of any (i) Taxes of Buyer or the Company attributable to
such refund or credit and 

 



84

    

 (ii) expenses incurred in obtaining such refund or credit) within 30 days
after receipt or settlement thereof. If any Tax refund paid to Sellers
pursuant to the preceding sentence is disallowed or required to be repaid to
a Governmental Authority, Sellers shall promptly reimburse Buyer for such
refund, _plus_ any interest and penalties payable therewith.

 

(f) _Amended Returns and Retroactive Tax Elections_. Except as required by
Applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company
to, (i) amend any Tax Returns filed with respect to any Tax year ending on or
before the Closing Date or (ii) make any Tax election that has retroactive
effect for any such Tax year, in each case without the prior written consent
of the Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

(g) _Tax Controversies_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, this  _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ (and not _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, other
than as expressly set forth therein) shall control with respect to any Tax
Matters with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and Straddle Period. Buyer
shall notify Sellers Representative in writing within five days of receipt by
Buyer or the Company of written notice of any Tax Matters from any Taxing
Authority. Sellers Representative may, at Sellers expense, participate in
and, upon written notice to Buyer within 10 days of receiving notice of a Tax
Matter, assume the defense of any such Tax Matter to the extent such Tax
Matter is solely with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that does not
include a Straddle Period. If Sellers Representative assumes such defense,
then Sellers Representative shall have the authority, with respect to such
Tax Matter, to represent the interests of the Company before the relevant
Taxing Authority and Sellerss Representative shall have the right to control
the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter, subject to
the limitations contained herein, including responding to inquiries, and
contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, such Tax Matter. If Sellers Representative assumes the defense of a Tax
Matter, Sellers Representative shall (i) not enter into any settlement of,
otherwise compromise or abandon any such Tax Matter without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, (ii) keep Buyer duly informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Matter and timely provide
Buyer with copies of all correspondence, notices and other written materials
received from any Taxing Authority with respect to such Tax Matter and (iii)
consult in good faith with Buyer with respect to any issue relating to such
Tax Matter. With respect to any Tax Matter with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period for which Sellers Representative has not assumed such defense or for
any Straddle Period, Buyer shall (i) not enter into any settlement of,
otherwise compromise or abandon any such Tax Matter without the prior written
consent of Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) keep Sellerss Representative duly
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax
Matter and timely provide Sellers Representative with copies of all
correspondence, notices and other written materials received from any Taxing
Authority with respect to such Tax Matter and (iii) consult in good faith
with Sellerss Representative with respect to any issue relating to such Tax
Matter.

 

(h) _Cooperation_. Sellers Representative and Buyer shall (and Buyer
shall cause the Company to) cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ and any Tax Claim. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any Tax
Claim or Tax Return (including

 



85

    

 Books and Records and other information with respect to FSRA), making
Employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer shall
(A) cause the Company to retain all Books and Records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods or
Straddle Periods until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, (B) abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Taxing Authority, and (C) give Sellers Representative reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if Sellers Representative requests, allow Sellers
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

 

(i) _280G._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will (i) submit to
all Persons entitled to vote (as determined in accordance with the Treasury
Regulations under Code Section 280G (the " _280G Vote_ ")) the material facts
(the " _280G Disclosure_ ") concerning all payments and benefits that the
Company (after consultation with Buyer) reasonably believes, in the absence
of shareholder approval of such payments and benefits, could be "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(1) ("
_Potential Parachute Payments_ "), in accordance with Code Section
280G(b)(5)(B), and (ii) solicit the approval and consent of all such Persons
with respect to the Potential Parachute Payments. Prior to the 280G Vote, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) who might receive any
Potential Parachute Payments to execute and deliver to the Company an
agreement to waive his or her Potential Parachute Payments unless the
shareholders of the Company approve such payments in accordance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (a " _280G Waiver_ "), and such 280G Waiver shall
continue to be in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Any Potential
Parachute Payments for which the requisite shareholder approval under Code
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) was not obtained shall, in accordance with the
280G Waivers entered into by the affected individuals, not be paid or
provided for in any manner. The Company agrees to provide Buyer written drafts
of the 280G Waiver, the 280G Disclosure, and other documents for the 280G Vote
in advance of delivering such documents to the disqualified individuals and
the Companys shareholders, as applicable, and allow Buyer a reasonable
opportunity to provide reasonable comments on such documents and the Company
shall incorporate any such reasonable comments into the documents.

(j) _Tax Sharing Agreements._ All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements (other than Commercial Tax Agreements) with respect to or
involving the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and after the
Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any
Liability thereunder.

 

(k) _Treatment as Purchase Price Adjustment._ For Tax purposes, the
Parties agree to treat all indemnification payments made under this Agreement
as adjustments to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law.

 

(l) _Coordination with General Indemnification._ In the event of any
conflict between the other provisions of  _Article VIII_ and this _Section_
__ _ 8.12_, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ shall govern the
indemnification rights and obligations of Buyer, Sellers, and their Affiliates
with respect to Tax matters.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS_

 

Section 9.1 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) To further induce Buyer to purchase the Purchased Shares, and in
consideration of the payments by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, each
Seller agrees, separately and not jointly, to the restrictive covenants
contained herein:

 

(i) Each Seller hereby agrees that he shall not, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for his own account, as a partner or

offering to provide to any Person, including but not limited to the Companys
suppliers and Customers, and any Person to whom Buyer, Buyers Affiliates, or
the Company provided services or goods in connection with the Business within
the 18 months prior to the Closing Date, any services or goods that are the
same or substantially similar to, and in competition with, the Company
Products offered by the Company in the Business during the 18 months prior to
the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Activities_ ", and any such Person who
engages in the Restricted Activities will be deemed to " _Compete_ " with the
Company).

(ii) Each Seller hereby agrees that he shall not, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for his own account, as a partner or
joint venturer with any other Person or as an employee, officer, agent,
manager, representative or member of any corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, association or other Person, own, manage, operate,
control or participate in the ownership (other than (A) as a minority
shareholder of any corporation or other entity the securities of which are
publicly held or traded or (B) as a passive investor, holding not more than 2%
of any class of equity securities, of such an entity which is not publicly
traded (such ownership, " _Permitted Ownership_ ")), management, operation or
control of any corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
proprietorship, association or other Person that Competes with the Company and
the Business by providing or offering to provide Restricted Activities.

(iii) Each Seller hereby agrees that he shall not, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for his own account, as a partner or
joint venturer with any other Person or as an employee, officer, agent,
manager, representative or member of any corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, association or other Person (other than Permitted
Ownership), solicit, induce or influence any Person who was a Customer of the
Company within 18 months prior to the Closing Date to discontinue, reduce the
extent of, discourage the development of or otherwise harm its relationship
with the Company.

 

(iv) Each Seller hereby agrees that he shall not, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for his own account, as a partner or
joint venturer with any other Person or as an

 



87

    

 employee, officer, agent, manager, representative or member of any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or other
Person (other than Permitted Ownership), solicit, induce or influence any
Person who was a vendor of the Company, supplier of the Company, lessor or
landlord of the Company within the 18 months prior to the Closing to
discontinue, reduce the extent of, discourage the development of or
otherwise harm such relationship.

(v) Each Seller hereby agrees that he shall not, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for his own account, as a partner or
joint venturer with any other Person or as an employee, officer, agent,
manager, representative or member of any corporation, limited liability
company, partnership association or other Person (other than Permitted
Ownership), recruit or solicit any person who was an Employee of the Company
as of the Closing Date to leave the Company for the purpose of working for
any Person who Competes with the Company, unless such Employees employment
has been terminated by the Company after Closing or more than 180 days shall
have passed since the Employees voluntary termination of his or her
employment with the Company.

(vi) Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein will prohibit any
Sellers (a) employment with or services to the Company or Buyer; (b)
involvement in charitable activities for which no compensation is paid; or (c)
ownership of real property and the leasing of the same to third parties
(including to the Company with respect to the Prosser Facility and the
Grandview Facility).

(b) Each of the covenants and agreements by Sellers contained in _Section_
__ _ 9.1(a)_ shall be deemed to be and construed as a covenant and agreement
independent of any other provision of this Agreement. Each Seller acknowledges
and agrees with respect to himself that the covenants set forth in _Section_
__ _ 9.1(a)_ are reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Business
and the business of Buyer, that Buyer shall sustain irreparable injury in the
event of a breach or threatened breach by such Seller of any of such
covenants and agreements and that Buyer does not and shall not have an
adequate remedy at Law for any such breach or threatened breach. Accordingly,
each Seller consents and agrees for himself that, if such Seller breaches or
threatens to breach any such covenant or agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to
immediate injunctive relief and to specific performance and that no Seller
shall assert in any action or Proceeding the defense or claim that Buyer has
an adequate remedy at Law. The foregoing shall not, however, be deemed to
limit the remedies of Buyer for any such breach or threatened breach. Any
claims with respect to a breach of the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.1(a)_ must be made (if at all) within 18 months after the expiration of
the applicable restricted period.

(c) Each Seller covenants and agrees that, if he violates any of the
covenants or agreements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, in addition to
any and all other remedies available to Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to an
accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation or benefits which any
Seller, directly or indirectly, has realized or may realize in connection with
any such violation; attorneys fees and costs; and such remedies shall be in
addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief, and/or other
rights or remedies to which Buyer is or may be entitled at law or in equity or
under this Agreement.

 



88

    

(d) In the event that any of the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_, shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of such Sections shall
nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid or
unenforceable parts had not been included therein. In the event that the scope
of the Restricted Activities shall be found by the Chosen Court to exceed the
maximum restriction on activities such court deems reasonable and
enforceable, such scope of activities or geographical area shall be deemed to
become and thereafter shall be the maximum scope of activities which such
court deems reasonable and enforceable.

 

(e) Each Seller has carefully read and considered the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_,
and _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ and, having done so, agrees that the restrictions
set forth in such Sections are fair and reasonable and are
reasonably required for the protection of the interests of Buyer and its
officers, directors, and other employees and that such restrictions are not
violative of any public policy.

 

Section 9.2 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that the success of the Company and the
Business after the Closing depends upon the continued preservation of the
confidentiality of certain information possessed by Sellers, that the
preservation of the confidentiality of such information by Sellers is an
essential premise of the bargain among Sellers and Buyer, and that
Buyer would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_. Accordingly, each Seller hereby agrees that such Seller
shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, disclose to any Person,
or use in a manner that would result in a breach of any of Sellers covenants
hereunder, any of Buyers Confidential Information or, following Closing, any
of the Companys Confidential Information, other than in connection with
such Sellers contracted services (if any) to the Company or Buyer pursuant
to the Consulting Agreements. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, "
_Confidential Information_ " means, with respect to Buyer or the Company (as
applicable) any information belonging or pertaining to such Person that is
confidential or proprietary to such Person, including, (i) in the case of
Buyer: (A) the identity of Buyer, and (B) the terms and conditions upon which
Buyer employs its employees and independent contractors; (ii) in the case of
the Company, (A) the Companys Customers and their purchasing histories, (B)
the Company vendors or potential vendors, and the terms or proposed terms
upon which the Company may purchase products and services from such vendors,
(C) the terms and conditions upon which the Company employs its Employees and
independent contractors; (D) technology used by the Company to provide
its services, (E) private information concerning the Companys Customers that
a Seller learns in the course of his ownership of the Company, including any
trade secrets and proprietary information involving the Company Products,
and (F) information provided to the Company by third parties under a duty to
maintain the confidentiality of such information; and (iii) in the case of
Buyer and the Company, such partys (A) marketing and/or business plans
and strategies, and (B) financial reports and analyses regarding the
revenues, expenses, profitability and operations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) has
been voluntarily disclosed to the public by Buyer or the Company (as
applicable), except where such public disclosure has been made by a Seller
after Closing without authorization from the Company; (ii) has been
independently developed and disclosed by others; or (iii) which has otherwise
entered the public domain through lawful means. Further, the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ will not prohibit (a) any retention of copies of
records or disclosure 

 



89

    

 (i) required by any Applicable Law so long as reasonable prior notice is
given to Buyer of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded to
Buyer to contest the same, (ii) required by any federal or state securities
Law or (iii) made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
defense of such enforcement by any other party or (b) the disclosure of
information in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. In the event that any
Seller or Affiliate thereof becomes legally compelled to disclose any
Confidential Information, such Seller or Affiliate thereof will notify Buyer
promptly in writing of such requirement so that Buyer may seek (at Buyers
sole cost) a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in Buyers sole
discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_. In
the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that
Buyer waives compliance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, each
Seller or Affiliate thereof, as the case may be, will furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information which such Seller or Affiliate thereof
is advised by counsel is legally required and will exercise commercially
reasonable efforts, at Buyers sole expense, to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded such furnished Confidential
Information.

(b) Each Seller agrees that such Seller shall not, directly or indirectly,
divulge or make use of any Confidential Information of Buyer or the Company.
Each Seller shall make all reasonable efforts to protect and maintain the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information of Buyer and, following the
Closing, the Company. In the event that a Seller becomes aware of unauthorized
disclosures of Buyers Confidential Information or, following Closing, the
Companys Confidential Information, by anyone at any time, whether
intentionally or by accident, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer and,
following Closing, the Company.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the success of the Company and
the Business depends upon the continued preservation of the confidentiality
of certain information possessed by Sellers, the Company, Buyer, or their
Affiliates, that the preservation of the confidentiality of such information
by the Parties is an essential premise of the bargain among Sellers and
Buyer, and that the each Party would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement
in the absence of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge that the information provided to it or its representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including
in connection with any diligence (whether prior to or after the Execution
Date) is subject to the terms of that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement
between Buyer, Cascadia Capital, and the Company, dated May 9, 2019 (the "
_NDA_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference and binding
on Sellers and Buyer. In the event Closing does not occur, the Parties will
remain bound by this provision and the NDA in accordance with its terms.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the NDA will terminate, provided,
however, that the terms of the NDA will continue to apply to the Excluded
Assets.

Section 9.3 _Public Announcements_.

 

(a) The Parties hereto will consult with each other before issuing press
releases or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Parties
hereto shall not issue any such press release or public statement without the
prior approval of the other Party (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 



90

    

(b) The restriction in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ shall not apply to the
extent the public announcement is required by Law or any Governmental
Authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Party making the announcement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other
Party in advance as to its form, content and timing. In addition, nothing in
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ will be deemed to limit a Partys ability to seek
enforcement of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 11.3_.
Neither Party will disclose to the public this Agreement, or any Schedules,
Exhibits, or other Transaction Documents, or the terms contained herein or
therein, other than and solely to the extent such Party determines in its
sole discretion that such disclosure is required by Law or Governmental
Authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers acknowledge Buyer will file
this Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on a timely
basis following its execution and otherwise make this Agreement available
pursuant to applicable securities Laws and securities exchange rules or
regulations.

 

ARTICLE X

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions described in this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior
to Closing only as follows:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Sellers Representative, on
behalf of Sellers;

(b) by Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers, on the one hand, or
Buyer on the other, if there has been a material breach (with respect to
representations and warranties not qualified by a materiality standard) or a
breach in any respect (with respect to representations and warranties
qualified by a materiality standard) on the part of the other Party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein which breach
would give rise to a failure of a closing condition in _Article VI_ (in the
case of Buyer seeking termination ) or _Article VII_ (in the case of Sellers
seeking termination), which breach cannot be cured by the Outside Date, in
each case unless such breach is the proximate result of one or more breaches
or violations of, or inaccuracies in, any covenant, agreement,
representation, or warranty of the party seeking termination;

(c) by Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers, or Buyer, if a
Governmental Authority shall have issued a final and non-appealable order,
injunction, judgment, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions set forth in
this Agreement, or if there shall be any Applicable Law that makes

hereto and to be delivered pursuant hereto constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all

modification or termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed
in writing by all of the Parties. Any Party hereto may (a) extend the time
for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party;

Agreement or any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant

be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver shall
be deemed to be, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other provision of this
Agreement, whether or not similar, nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. The representations
and warranties of each Party hereto shall be deemed to be material and to have
been relied upon by the other Parties, notwithstanding any investigation
heretofore or hereafter made by the other Parties.

the transactions described in this Agreement, or the relationship between the
Parties hereto, whether in tort or contract or at law or in equity,

Section 11.12 _Sellers_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints the
Sellers Representative as its agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact,
with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of such
Seller with respect to the transactions described in this Agreement, to
calculate ultimately and to resolve any disputes regarding the amount of the
Indebtedness and the Transaction Expenses, and to act on behalf of such Seller
in any amendment of or litigation involving this Agreement or any claim
for indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_ or under the Escrow Agreement
and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and to
execute all such documents, as the Sellers Representative shall deem
necessary or appropriate in conjunction with any of the transactions
described in this Agreement, including the power:

(i) to take all action necessary or desirable in connection with the
waiver of any condition to the obligations of each Seller to consummate the
transactions described in this Agreement;

 

(ii) to negotiate, execute (or have executed) and deliver all ancillary
agreements (including the Transaction Documents), statements, certificates,
notices, approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments and other
documents required or permitted to be given in connection with the
consummation of the transactions described in this Agreement (it being
understood that, upon request by Buyer, each Seller shall execute and deliver
any such documents which the Sellers Representative agrees to execute);

 

(iii) to act for Sellers with respect to all Purchase Price matters,
including all Purchase Price allocation and adjustment matters referred to
herein, including without limitation, calculation of Indebtedness, calculation
of Transaction Expenses, calculation and delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet
and Post-Closing Adjustments; and

 



95

    

(iv) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection
with any claims under this Agreement and to take all actions necessary to
settle, pay or take any other actions with respect to each Sellers indemnity
obligations under _Article VIII_ ; and

(v) to take all actions which under this Agreement may be taken by a
Seller (including under _Article VIII_ ) and to do or refrain from doing any
further act or deed on behalf of a Seller which the Sellers Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in his sole discretion relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement as fully and completely as a Seller could do if
personally present.

(b) The Sellers Representative hereby accepts his appointment as
attorney-in-fact for each Seller.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
in any other agreement executed in connection with the transactions described
in this Agreement: (i) each Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to deal
exclusively with the Sellers Representative on all matters relating to any
claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to _Article
II_ or _Article VIII_ or pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) Buyer,
each Buyer Indemnified Party, the Escrow Agent and each Seller shall be
entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
a Seller by the Sellers Representative, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of a Seller by the Sellers Representative,
as fully binding upon each Seller. A decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Sellers Representative, including an amendment, extension, waiver or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ or _Section_
__ _ 11.1_, shall constitute a decision of each Seller and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each Seller; and the Escrow Agent and Buyer may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of Sellers
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
Seller. The Escrow Agent and Buyer are hereby relieved from any Liability to
any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative.

(d) Each Seller recognizes and intends that the power of attorney granted
in this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_: (i) is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable, (ii) may be delegated by the Sellers Representative and (iii)
shall survive the death, dissolution, sale or other change of control of a
Seller.

(e) The Sellers Representative will incur no Liability of any kind with
respect to any action or omission by the Sellers Representative in connection
with the Sellers Representatives services pursuant to this Agreement and
shall not be responsible to a Seller for any Losses or expenses that a Seller
may suffer by reason of the performance by the Sellers Representative of its
duties under this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_ other than Losses or other damages
arising from the fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation in
the performance of the Sellers Representatives duties under this _Section_
__ _ 11.12_. By virtue of the execution of this Agreement, each Seller hereby
agrees to release, defend and hold harmless the Sellers Representative, his

 



96

    

 agents and Affiliates (the " _Representative Parties_ ") from, and to
indemnify the Representative Parties against, any and all losses, Liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel) for any action taken or
not taken by the Sellers Representative in his capacity as attorney-in-fact
under this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_, other than Losses or other damages arising
from the fraud, willful breach or intentional misrepresentation in the
performance of the Sellers Representatives duties under this _Section_ __ _
11.12_. Each Seller agrees to reimburse the Sellers Representative for any
costs, expenses or indemnification obligations that the
Sellers Representative incurs on behalf of Sellers under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agent.

(f) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that any and all fees and expenses
of the Sellers Representative incurred in connection with the performance of
the Sellers Representatives duties hereunder, and any and all claims,
expenses, Losses, or other costs which may come due as an obligation of
Sellers hereunder, including without limitation payment of Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses, shall be, as among Sellers, the obligation of each
Sellers proportionate to their Percentage Interest (a " _Proportionate
Share_ "), and each Seller hereby agrees that to the extent Sellers are
obligated to make payments of any such obligations pursuant to this Agreement,
then Sellers Representative may offset such claims against any amounts due
to Sellers hereunder, proportionate to such Sellers Percentage Interest, and
upon notice from the Sellers Representative of such a claim, each Seller
shall contribute such Sellers Proportionate Share to the Sellers
Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five
Business Days after receipt of such notice.

 

(g) The Sellers Representative may resign at any time. Sellers (acting by
majority of their respective Percentage Interests) shall designate a
replacement Sellers Representative upon the resignation, death or disability
causing him to be unable to serve, of the Sellers Representative by written
notice to Buyer.

 

Section 11.13 _Privilege_. The Parties agree that the fact that Davis
Wright Tremaine LLP has represented the Company and/or Sellers prior to
Closing shall not prevent Davis Wright Tremaine LLP from representing Sellers
in connection with any matters involving, including any disputes with, any of
the other Parties after Closing solely to the extent related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties further agree
that the attorney-client privilege between Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, on the
one hand, and the Company and Sellers, on the other hand, as to communications
solely relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
prior to and through the Closing Date shall belong to Sellers after the
Closing Date, and not the Company or Buyer, and will be considered Excluded
Assets for purposes of this Agreement. Any access by the Company to attorney-
client privileged communications related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby after the Closing Date will not waive or otherwise affect
the rights of Sellers with respect to the attorney-client privilege except as
pursuant to any Applicable Law or determined by any Governmental Authority.
The Parties agree that should the Company or Buyer discover attorney-client
privileged communications in their possession solely to the extent related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, they will immediately
notify Sellers, will not review such communications, and will return such
communications to Sellers.
