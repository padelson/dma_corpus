pursuant to this Agreement (a &#147;<U>Third-Party Claim</U>&#148;), the applicable Indemnified Party shall
promptly give the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail, to the extent possible, the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability
arising therefrom and the basis of the claim. Such notice shall be a condition precedent to any

result from or are caused by such failure. The applicable Indemnified Party may settle, compromise

into this Agreement to the same extent as though fully set forth herein (<U>provided</U> that in

other schedules and sections is reasonably apparent on its face, regardless of whether a
cross-reference to the applicable schedule and/or section is actually made. Any matter disclosed
in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission or representation as to the
materiality of the item so disclosed, and matters disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedules. Nothing in the Disclosure Schedules constitutes an admission of any liability or
obligation of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of the Members to any third party or shall
confer or give to any third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or
other right.

Section&nbsp;2.1(d)(3) of this Agreement, any controversy, claim or dispute involving the parties (or
their affiliated Persons) directly or indirectly concerning this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof, including, without limitation, any issues and matters arising under the federal and state
securities laws and questions concerning the scope and applicability of this Section&nbsp;10.14 shall be
brought in any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or
action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of forum,
agrees that all claims in respect of the proceeding or action shall be heard and determined only in
any such court, and agrees not to bring any proceeding or action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained
shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by
Applicable Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in any
other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding
brought pursuant to this Section&nbsp;10.14.

connection with this Agreement, the Members Representative and the Members (collectively, the
&#147;<U>Selling Members</U>&#148;) shall have the right, at their election, to retain the firm of
Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &#038; Walker LLP to represent them in such matter, and Buyer, for itself,

respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waives and consents to any such
representation in any such matter and the communication by such counsel to the Selling Members
regarding matters relating to or arising from this Agreement of any fact known to such counsel
arising by reason of such counsel&#146;s prior representation of the Selling Members or the Company.
Buyer, for itself, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company and for Buyer&#146;s, Merger Sub&#146;s and the
Surviving Company&#146;s respective successors and assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between the Selling Members and counsel, including, without limitation, Paul,
Hastings, Janofsky &#038; Walker LLP, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this
Agreement which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged communications
of the Selling Members and their counsel and would not be subject to disclosure to Buyer, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Company in connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under or
in connection with, this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing to be privileged
communications between the Selling Members and such counsel and none of Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company or any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Company shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attaching to such communications belongs to Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Company and not the Selling Members. Other than as explicitly set forth in this Section
10.15, the parties acknowledge that any attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of legal
counsel representing the Company prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and continue to be
a privilege of the Company, and not the Selling Members, after the Closing.
