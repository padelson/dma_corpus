Sheet and the calculations described in Section 2.1(d) become final and
binding upon the parties in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(d),
then, within ten (10) days following the date such calculations become final
and binding: (i) if any Post-Closing Reduction is required, Buyer and Members
Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately deliver from
the Escrow Account such Post-Closing Reduction to Buyer in immediately
available funds by wire transfer; and (ii) if any Post-Closing Addition is
required, Buyer shall immediately deliver such Post-Closing Addition in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Members Representative

(d) _Closing Balance Sheet_. 

  

(1) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than the
ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the
Members Representative an unaudited final Closing Balance Sheet, as well as
its calculations of the final Net Working Capital as of the Accounting
Effective Time based on the Closing Balance Sheet, the final Indebtedness
as of the Accounting Effective Time based upon the Closing Balance Sheet and
the final Cash and Cash Equivalents based upon the Closing Balance Sheet, in
each case without giving effect to the Merger or any financing transactions
in connection therewith. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP as applied by the Company in the preparation of the
Balance Sheet. If the Members Representative objects to Buyers calculation
of the final Net Working Capital, Indebtedness or Cash and Cash Equivalents,
the Members Representative shall within thirty (30) days after receipt
thereof notify Buyer of the same in writing, which such notice shall include
a description in reasonable detail of the basis of such objection and the
Members Representatives proposed modification of any such calculation. If
the Members Representative does not object to any such calculation within
such thirty (30)-day period, Buyers calculations shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. 

  

(2) If Buyer disagrees with all or any portion of the Members Representatives
proposed modification of the final Net Working Capital, Indebtedness or Cash
and Cash Equivalents delivered by the Members Representative pursuant to
Section 2.1(d)(1) above, the parties shall confer in an effort to resolve
their differences during the fifteen (15)-day period following delivery of
such proposed modification by the Members Representative. If Buyer does not
object to the Members Representatives proposed modification of the final Net
Working Capital, Indebtedness and/or Cash and Cash Equivalents delivered by
the Members Representative pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(1) above within fifteen
(15) days following the delivery of such proposed modification by the
Members Representative, the Members Representatives proposed modification
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. 

  

(3) If, upon completion of such fifteen (15)-day period described in the first
sentence of Section 2.1(d)(2) above, Buyer and the Members Representative are
unable to resolve their differences, they shall promptly thereafter cause
McGladrey and Pullen, LLP (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") to review this
Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating
the final Net Working Capital, Indebtedness and/or Cash and Cash Equivalents,
as applicable. In making such calculation, the Independent Accountant shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet or the
calculation of the final Net Working Capital, Indebtedness and/or Cash and
Cash Equivalents as to which Buyer and the Members Representative
have disagreed. The Independent Accountant shall deliver to the Members
Representative and Buyer, as promptly as practicable, a report setting forth
its calculations. Such report shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
Buyer, the Surviving Company and the Members. The cost of such review and
report shall be paid (i) one-half from the amounts deposited in the Reserve
Account by or on behalf of the Members (and thereafter by the Non-Trust Unit
Holders, Pro Rata) and (ii) one-half by Buyer. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(4) The parties hereto agree that they will cooperate in good faith in the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the estimated

in the conduct of the reviews referred to in Sections 2.1(c) and (d),
including, without limitation, making available, to the extent
necessary, books, records, work papers and personnel on a reasonable basis
during normal business hours. 

  

(e) _Escrow_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver $20,000,000 (the "
_Escrow Amount_ ") of the aggregate Merger Consideration that would otherwise
be payable to all Non-Trust Unit Holders at the Closing in respect of all
Company Units owned by them (the " _Aggregate Non-Trust Unit Holder Closing
Consideration_ ") to U.S. Bank National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ")
for deposit into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") in accordance
with the terms of an escrow agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
D_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The amount by which each Non-Trust Unit
Holders share of the Aggregate Non-Trust Unit Holder Closing Consideration
will be reduced in respect of the Escrow Amount is set forth opposite such
Non-Trust Unit Holders name on _Exhibit C_. The fees and expenses of the
Escrow Agent shall be paid in the same manner as set forth in the last
sentence of Section 2.1(d)(3). The Escrow Amount so deposited shall be
applied by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, Buyer and Members Representative
shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrow Funds to the
Members Representative and/or the Non-Trust Unit Holders in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement and _Exhibit C_, upon the Release Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the funds
reasonably necessary to satisfy any claim for indemnification against
the Members still pending as of the Release Date will be retained by the
Escrow Agent until such claim is resolved. 

  

(f) _Reserve Account_. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver $500,000 (the "
_Reserve Amount_ ") of the Aggregate Non-Trust Unit Holder Closing
Consideration to the Members Representative for deposit into a bank account
(the " _Reserve Account_ ") controlled by the Members Representative to be
used to cover the costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the
Members Representative in defending and/or resolving any indemnification
claims brought by the Buyer Indemnified Party under Article VII, cash or
expenses incurred by the Non-Trust Unit Holders for services of the
Independent Accountant, or any other costs or expenses incurred by the
Members Representative in the performance of its obligations as Members
Representative. The amount by which each Non-Trust Unit Holders share of the
Aggregate Non-Trust Unit Holder Closing Consideration will be reduced in
respect of the Reserve Amount is set forth opposite such Non-Trust Unit
Holders name on _Exhibit C_. Amounts in the Reserve Account shall be
disbursed by the Members Representative as provided in this Agreement. The
Members Representative shall distribute all amounts remaining in the Reserve
Account to the Non-Trust Unit Holders, in accordance with  _Exhibit C_, upon
the later of the Release Date and the resolution of all
indemnification claims against the Members still pending as of the Release
Date.

allocating the purchase price (together with all amounts treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the assets acquired
incident to the Merger in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the regulation promulgated thereunder. The Members Representative shall agree
to any such purchase price allocation unless such proposed allocation is
unreasonable. Except to the extent required by Applicable Law, each of Buyer
and the Members shall prepare and file all Tax Returns and other statements
in a manner consistent with the purchase price allocation schedule and shall
not make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any Tax Returns or
otherwise during the course of an audit, investigation or other dispute with
a Tax Authority.

amount of capital with which to conduct its business, and (d) such Person
does not plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or come

the Company pursuant to this Agreement solely for its own account and with no
intention of distributing or reselling such equity interests or any part

voluntarily by such employee) on the Closing Date or within 12 months
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Company to

(b) to continued employment with the Company, any Subsidiary, the Surviving
Company or any Affiliate of the Surviving Company. No provision of

following: (i) the net recovery pursuant to any insurance policy recovered by
any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of the Losses (less any retroactive
premium adjustment); and (ii) the amount of any reduction in cash Taxes
payable that would otherwise be due or the receipt of a refund of Taxes of any
Buyer Indemnified Party, in each case only with respect to any taxable year
in which the Loss was incurred or paid, whether received or realized in such
taxable year or thereafter. If an indemnification payment is received by any
Buyer Indemnified Party, and such Buyer Indemnified Party later receives
insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries or tax benefits in respect
of the related Losses that were not previously credited against such
indemnification payment when made, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay to the Members Representative, on behalf of the Members, a sum
equal to the lesser of (i) the actual amount of such insurance proceeds
(after giving effect to any deductible), other third party recoveries and tax
benefits with respect to such Losses and (ii) the actual amount of the
indemnification payment previously paid by such Members with respect to such
Losses, in each case reduced by related costs of recovery. Each
Buyer Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable and good faith
efforts to collect amounts available under insurance coverages relating to
any Losses for which it is seeking indemnification under this Article VII. 

  

(f) If the Merger Consideration is adjusted downward due to facts or
circumstances that give rise to any Post-Closing Reduction pursuant to
Section 2.1(c)(2) of this Agreement, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not
also be entitled to indemnification for breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements arising from such
facts or circumstances to the extent the Losses asserted therefor are
reflected in the final Net Working Capital or final Indebtedness. 

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement or any of the Transaction
Documents shall not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time,
or any knowledge acquired at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy, of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. 

  

Section 7.2 _Notice to Indemnifying Party_. A claim for indemnification for
any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the
party from whom indemnification is sought. If any Buyer Indemnified Party or
Member Indemnified Party receives notice of any claim or other commencement
of any action or proceeding by a Person who is not a party to this
Agreement with respect to which the Indemnifying Parties are or may be
obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the applicable Indemnified Party shall promptly give the
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof, which notice shall specify
in reasonable detail, to the extent possible, the amount or an estimate of
the amount of the liability arising therefrom and the basis of the claim.
Such notice shall be a condition precedent to any liability of the
Indemnifying Party for indemnification hereunder, but the failure of
the applicable Indemnified Party to give prompt notice of a claim shall not
release, waive or adversely affect such Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification hereunder except and only to the extent that the defense of
that claim is prejudiced by such failure or to the extent that any
Losses result from or are caused by such failure. The applicable Indemnified
Party may settle, compromise or consent to entry of any judgment with respect
to any claim by a third party for which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder and for which the Indemnifying Party has elected not to take
control of after notification thereof as provided in this Agreement, 
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to any such
settlement, compromise or judgment. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 7.3 _Defense by Members_. In connection with any Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party,
assume the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, the costs and
expenses of which (if the Members are the Indemnifying Party) shall be paid
from the amounts deposited in the Reserve Account by or on behalf of the Non-
Trust Unit Holders (and thereafter by the Non-Trust Unit Holders, Pro Rata); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
control of such defense, it shall agree in writing, if the Indemnified Party
is a Buyer Indemnified Party, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification from the Escrow Account for all Losses relating to such
Third-Party Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII
but no other limitations, qualifications or reservations of rights;
_provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to assume control of such defense and the settlement thereof at the
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party failed
or is failing to diligently prosecute or defend such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding,
it may use counsel of its choice to prosecute such defense, subject to the
approval of such counsel by the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action, with its
counsel and at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in such defense with separate counsel
(with its expenses subject to indemnification under this Article VII) if, in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make
such separate representation advisable; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that the fees and expenses of no more than one such counsel (and local
counsel, if necessary) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
such claim shall be subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII.
The parties shall cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any such claim or legal proceeding,
with the consent of Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) without the written
consent of Buyer, the Members Representative shall not settle or compromise
any Third-Party Claim for which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant Section 7.1(a) unless all amounts paid or to be paid
in settlement of such Third-Party Claim are paid or to be paid from the Escrow
Account and (b) no Indemnifying Party may, without the written consent of the
applicable Indemnified Parties, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment if any such settlement,
compromise or judgment (i) fails to provide to the Indemnified Parties an
unqualified release from the claimant or claimants with respect to all Losses
in respect of the Third-Party Claim, (ii) imposes an injunction on any
Indemnified Party, or (iii) includes the finding of any criminal violation by
any Indemnified Party. 

  

Section 7.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect
to any claim for indemnification, the Members shall not be liable under
Section 7.1(a)(1) or Section 7.1(a)(4) for any Losses unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses incurred or suffered thereunder exceeds
$1,500,000 (One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) (the " _Deductible
Amount_ "), at which time only Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount may
be claimed. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Subject to the last sentence of Section 7.1(c) and the proviso set forth
in the first sentence of Section 7.1(b), notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the aggregate amount of all
indemnification obligations of the Members under this Agreement exceed the
Escrow Amount. 

  

Section 7.5 _Treatment of Indemnification Payment_. Any payment made after the
Closing pursuant to indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all
purposes, including federal, state and local Tax and, to the extent permitted
under GAAP, financial accounting purposes; _provided_ ,  _however_ , in no
event shall any such payment in and of itself be deemed or construed to cause
a breach with respect to any of the Companys representations and warranties
in Section 3.7 concerning the Financial Statements. 

  

Section 7.6 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.
Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained herein or in
any Transaction Document shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Closing and shall thereafter terminate and expire on May
30, 2012 (the " _Release Date_ "). Each representation and warranty of the
Members contained in their Member Letters shall survive the Closing
indefinitely. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, after the
Release Date, no party, nor any shareholder, member, owner, affiliate,
director, manager, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of
any party, shall have any liability for any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth herein or in any
Transaction Document (including, without limitation, any covenant or
agreement to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII);
_provided_ , _however_ , that any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in respect of which a claim for indemnification has been asserted
in writing under this Article VII prior to the Release Date, as well as the
covenants and agreements to indemnify an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Article VII in respect thereof, shall survive until such claim
for indemnification is resolved but only with respect to such claims made
prior to the Release Date. 

  

Section 7.7 _Indemnification by Buyer and the Surviving Company_. After the
Closing, Buyer and the Surviving Company shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Members (collectively, the " _Member Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any and all Losses which are incurred or suffered by any
such party and which arise out of or result from any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Buyer, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Company contained in this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII. 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

Section 8.1 _Directors and Officers Insurance_. 

  

(a) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years after the
Closing Date, Buyer and the Surviving Company shall continue to provide (at
the sole expense of Buyer and the Surviving Company) any Person who is on the
date hereof an officer, director or manager of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and managers liability insurance coverage
(" _D andO Insurance_") with respect to all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys
fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding
or investigation (each a " _D andO Claim_") to the extent that any such DandO
Claim is based on, or arises out of: (a) the fact that such Person is or was
a director, manager or officer of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries at
any time prior to the Closing Date or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries as a director, manager, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, trust or other entity or enterprise at any time prior to the
Closing Date; or (b) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby in each case to the extent that any such DandO Claim pertains
to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring prior to or at the
Closing Date, regardless of whether such DandO Claim is asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing Date, which coverage will be substantially
similar to the Companys existing DandO Insurance, a copy of which has been
made available to Buyer, including, without limitation, (x) an overall
coverage amount not less than the overall coverage amount under the Companys
existing DandO Insurance and (y) coverage for employment practices claims and
for liability under the Securities Act, and Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Act, as amended, in an amount not less than the coverage amounts for
such liabilities under the Companys existing DandO Insurance. Such coverage
shall be extended under the existing DandO Insurance by obtaining,
simultaneously with or promptly after Closing, a six-year "tail." 

  

(b) For a period of six years following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the officers, directors and
managers of the Company and the Subsidiaries against all liabilities arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date to the
extent such officers, directors or managers would be entitled
to indemnification under the certificate of formation or limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Company in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Surviving Company Charter Documents_ ") or any
of the Subsidiaries Charter Documents relating to exculpation or
indemnification of any officers, directors or managers, it being the intent of
the parties hereto that the persons who served as officers, directors and/or
managers of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries at any time prior to the
Effective Time shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent set forth therein. 

  

(c) In the event that Buyer or the Surviving Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries, successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its assets or properties to any Person, Buyer shall use its best efforts
to ensure that proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Buyer, the Surviving Company or their respective subsidiaries (as
applicable) assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.1. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) This Section 8.1, which shall survive the Closing and the Effective Time,
is intended to benefit any Person referenced in this Section 8.1 or
indemnified hereunder, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
Section 8.1 (whether or not parties to this Agreement). 

  

(e) By executing the Member Letter, each holder of Company Units shall be
deemed, without further action, to have irrevocably waived any claim it may
have against the Company and any officer, director or manager of the Company
for contribution or reimbursement for payment of indemnification claims made
by any Buyer Indemnified Party under Article VII hereof. 

  

Section 8.2 _Tax Matters_. 

  

(a) _Tax Returns_. 

  

(i) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns for_ _Pass-Through Entities_. The
Members Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or
cause to be filed, all Tax returns, reports, statements or estimates (" _Tax
Returns_ ") for the Company and any of its Subsidiaries that are not treated
as a C corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed
after the Closing Date. The Surviving Company shall provide the Members
Representative and its accountants any information necessary for the timely
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. In addition, the Surviving
Company shall reimburse the Members Representative for one-half of the cost of
the preparation of such Tax Returns. The Members Representative shall provide
a copy of such returns or cause a copy of such Tax Returns to be provided to
Buyer no later than thirty (30) days prior to filing any such Tax Return so
that Buyer can confirm that the Section 754 election certificate provided to
it under Section 6.1(h) will be filed. 

  

(ii) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns for C Corporation Entities_. The Surviving
Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed (at its own expense), all Tax Returns for the Company and any of the
Subsidiaries that are treated as a C corporation immediately prior to the
Effective Time for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on or prior to the
Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the filing of a Tax Return of the Company or a Subsidiary that is
treated as a C corporation would give rise to a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement for purposes of Section 7.1(a)(1), the
Surviving Company shall submit such Tax Return to the Members Representative
for its approval (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) no later
than thirty (30) days prior to filing any such Tax Return. 

  

(iii) _Straddle Period Returns_. The Surviving Company shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed (at its own expense),
all Tax Returns for the Company and any of the Subsidiaries for any Straddle
Period which are filed after the Closing Date. No later than thirty (30) days
prior to filing any such Tax Return (other than any such Tax Return
that relates solely to periods beginning and ending after the Closing Date),
the Surviving Company shall submit such Tax Return to the Members
Representative for its review (which consent should not be unreasonably
withheld). 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Buyer and/or its Affiliates (including on or after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Company and the Subsidiaries) shall not file, or cause to be filed,
any restatement or amendment of, modification to, or claim for refund
relating to, any Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary that is treated
as a pass-through entity for US federal income tax purposes for any taxable
period that begins prior to the Closing Date (regardless of whether such
taxable period ends prior to the Closing Date) without the prior written
consent of the Members Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). Buyer and/or its Affiliates may file or cause to be
filed any restatement or amendment of, modification to or claim for refund
relating to any Tax Return of the Company or a Subsidiary that is treated as
a C corporation without limitation, provided that any such restatement,
amendment, modification or claim for refund shall not be deemed to be a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement for purposes of
_Section 7.1(a)(1)_. 

  

(c) Consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-6, each of the Company, the Members
Representative and Buyer and the Affiliates (including, after the Closing
Date, the Surviving Company and the Subsidiaries) agree to treat, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the transfer of interests by the Members to
Buyer as follows: (i) as to the Members, as a transfer of interests by the
Members to Buyer; (ii) as to Buyer, as if the Company had distributed in
liquidation of the Company to each of the Members their respective pro rata
share of the assets and as if the Members had sold to Buyer their respective
pro rata share of the assets received from the Company. The parties
hereto further agree that (A) the transfer of the interests shall result in a
termination of the Company for purposes of Section 708 of the Code, (B) the
taxable year of the Company shall close as of the end of the day on the
Closing Date, and (C) any business conducted by the Company, any
Subsidiary or the Surviving Company following the Closing Date shall be for
the account of Buyer. 

  

(d) Items of income and expense through the Closing Date with respect to the
Company, and with respect to the Subsidiaries which are taxed as
partnerships, shall be allocated to the Members (other than the First Trust
and Second Trust). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the
extent that any payments made by the Company or any Subsidiary on the Closing
Date or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including, without limitation, the First Trust Payments, the Second Trust
Payments and the Employee Payment Amount) constitute tax deductible expenses
in the Company or in a Subsidiary which is taxed as a partnership, the
Members (other than the First Trust and Second Trust) shall be allocated the
tax deductions relating to such payments. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereto agree that the aggregate amount of the First Trust Payments
and Second Trust Payments paid or to be paid to the First Trust Beneficiaries
and Second Trust Beneficiaries (whether paid on or after the Closing Date)
and the Employee Payment Amount, excluding payments with respect to employees
of Subsidiaries that are taxed as C corporations immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be treated as tax deductible expenses of the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary as of the Closing Date and the Members (other than
the First Trust and Second Trust) shall be allocated the tax deductions
relating to such payments. Buyer agrees that it will not claim a tax
deduction relating to such payments and Buyer will cause the
Surviving Company and the Subsidiaries not to claim a tax deduction relating
to such payments for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) _Consents_. 

  

(i) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns for Pass-Through Entities._ Members
Representative will have the exclusive authority to represent the Company and
any of the Subsidiaries that are not treated as a C Corporation immediately
prior to the Effective Time with respect to any inquiries, claims,
assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes before any Taxing
Authority or any other Authority (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit
or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ ") regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period of
such entity or entities that ends on or prior to the Closing Date which are
filed after the Closing Date, and will have the sole right to extend or waive
the statute of limitations with respect to a Tax Matter and to control the
defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Matter, including, without
limitation, responding to inquiries, filing tax returns and settling audits;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Members Representative will not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax Matter that affects or may
affect the ongoing tax liability of a Surviving Company in a Post-Closing
Tax Period, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

  

(ii) _Contests Giving Rise to Indemnification Obligation_. Except as provided
in section (i), above, Buyer will have the exclusive authority to represent
the Company and the Surviving Company with respect to any Tax Matter before
any Taxing Authority or any other Authority, and will have the sole right to
extend or waive the statute of limitations with respect to a Tax Matter and
to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax
Matter, including, without limitation, responding to inquiries, filing tax
returns and settling audits;  _provided_ , _however_ , if the Tax Matter
involves Taxes for which Members may be liable under this Agreement, Buyer
will promptly notify the Members Representative and the
Members Representative will have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the
notice to elect to participate in the joint defense of the Tax Matter giving
rise to the potential liability. If the Members Representative elects to
participate in the joint defense of the Tax Matter, Buyer and
Members Representative will select counsel mutually agreeable to the parties
(and divide the costs evenly) to contest the liability and no settlement of
or other compromise of any Tax Matter may be made without the prior written
consent of both the Members Representative and Buyer. If the
Members Representative does not elect to participate in the joint defense,
Buyer will have the exclusive authority to represent the Company and the
Surviving Company with respect to any Tax Matter, but may not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax Matter that affects or
may affect the liability of a Member, or any Affiliate of a Member, without
the prior written consent of the Members Representative, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In this case, the Members
Representative will agree to bear a portion of the Buyers third party costs
to contest and document the settlement of the Tax Matter. The amount of the
third party costs to be borne by the Members Representative with respect to a
Tax Matter shall be equal to the third party costs incurred with respect to
the Tax Matter multiplied by a ratio in which the numerator is equal to the
Members Representatives potential liability with respect to the issue under
Section 7.1 (reduced for any Deductible Amount applicable thereto under
Section 7.4, subject to the terms thereof) and the denominator is equal to
the aggregate amount of the liability at issue with

  

    ##### 

  

   

respect to the Tax Matter. Buyer will keep the Members Representative fully
and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
Tax Matter. Buyer will, in good faith, consult with the Members
Representative regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such
proceeding. Buyer will not file or cause or permit to be filed any amended
tax return relating to such matters without the prior written consent of the
Members Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If the Members Representative does not elect to participate in the
joint defense of an issue, the Members Representative may elect to waive, in
writing, any right to consent to the settlement of a Tax Matter within the
thirty (30) day notice period described above. If the Members
Representative waives the consent right in writing, the Members
Representative shall not be required to reimburse any of the costs incurred
with respect to the defense of a Tax Matter. 

  

Section 8.3 _Earn-Out Obligations_. On the Closing Date after the Effective
Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving Company to pay the Earn-Out Obligations
to the Persons identified on  _Schedule 8.3_ hereto in the amount set forth
opposite each such Persons name on such Schedule out of funds provided by
Buyer to the extent such amounts were not paid prior to the Closing. 

  

Section 8.4 _Trust Payments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but subject to Section 2.1(b)(6), (1) any amounts to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the First Trust Units or to the
First Trust or First Trust Beneficiaries shall be paid to the First Trustee,
and (2) any amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the
Second Trust Units or to the Second Trust or Second Trust Beneficiaries shall
be paid to the Second Trustee. 

  

Section 8.5 _Bonus Payments_. Subject to the following sentence, the Surviving
Company shall pay bonuses and commissions to the individuals (" _Bonus
Eligible Employees_ ") and in the amounts specified for such individuals on
_Schedule 8.5_ (which amounts are accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet and
included in the calculation of Net Working Capital) in respect of the annual
bonuses for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 (" _2010 Bonus Payments_
") and any earned but unpaid commission payments (" _Commission Payments_ ").
The 2010 Bonus Payments shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing Date, but in no event later than December 31, 2010. The
Commission Payments shall be paid on the date provided for the payment
of such commissions in, and in accordance with the terms of, the Companys
commission plans in effect at the Closing.

Agreement (with such modifications or changes therein as to which the Members
Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have consented), (ii) to
communicate to, and receive all

  

    ##### 

  

   

communications and notices from, Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company,

such litigation, action, proceeding or investigation, (ix) to use the Reserve
Account in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and (x) to make,

and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all actions that
the Members Representative, in its sole discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. The
Members Representative shall, in this regard, have all of the rights and
powers which the Members would otherwise have, and the Members agree that
Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to rely
exclusively upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Members
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any of
the foregoing matters. The Members Representative shall for all purposes be
deemed the sole authorized agent of the Members until such time as the agency
is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2 below. Each of the Members agrees that
such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable
without the consent of the Members Representative and shall survive the
death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Member. All
decisions and actions by the Members Representative shall be binding upon all
of the Members, and no Member shall have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same. 

  

Section 9.2 _Resignation or Removal of the Members Representative_. The
Members Representative may be removed by the Members at any time upon the
vote of Members holding a majority of the Preferred Units (and, if after the
Closing, Members who held a majority of the Preferred Units as of immediately
prior to the Closing). Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a
successor Members Representative as provided below, the Members Representative
may resign at any time thirty (30) days after giving notice thereof to the
Members. Upon any such removal or resignation, the Members may appoint a
successor Members Representative by a vote of Members holding a majority of
the Preferred Units (and, if after the Closing, Members who held a
majority of the Preferred Units as of immediately prior to the Closing). If
no successor Members Representative shall have been appointed by the Members
and accepted such appointment within twenty (20) days after the retiring
Members Representatives giving of notice of resignation or the Members
removal of the Members Representative, then the retiring Members
Representative may, on behalf of the Members, appoint a successor. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as the Members Representative hereunder, such
successor Members Representative shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Members Representative, and the retiring Members Representative shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring
Members Representatives resignation or removal hereunder as the
Members Representative, the provisions of Section 9.3 shall continue in
effect for such retiring Members Representatives benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Members
Representative. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 9.3 _Liability of Members Representative_. The Members Representative
shall not incur any liability to the Members with respect to any action taken
in reliance upon any note, direction, instruction, consent, statement or
other document believed by the Members Representative to be genuinely and
duly authorized, or for any other action or inaction in its capacity as
the Members Representative, excepting only the fraud or willful misconduct of
the Members Representative. The Members Representative may, in all questions
arising hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, rely on the advice of legal
counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Members Representative based on such advice, the Members Representative shall
not be liable to any Member while acting in its capacity as Members
Representative. Each Non-Trust Unit Holder shall be liable, Pro Rata, for any
fees, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) paid or incurred by the Members Representative in
connection with the performance of its obligations as Members Representative,
including in the defense of any indemnification claim brought against the
Members under Article VII. The payment of such fees, costs and expenses shall
first be made by the Members Representative out of the Reserve Account, and
thereafter the Members Representative shall have the right to demand payment
with respect to such fees, costs and expenses from each Non-Trust Unit
Holder, Pro Rata.

signed on behalf of each of Buyer and the Members Representative.

Section 10.4 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns;  _provided_ that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the written consent of Buyer and the
Members Representative (and, if prior to the Effective Time, the Company),

without such consent shall be void. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 10.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict
of laws. 

  

Section 10.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
including electronically transmitted counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but
one and the same agreement. 

  

Section 10.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Transaction Documents, the Disclosure Schedules, the exhibits and schedules
hereto and any other agreements entered into in writing as of the date hereof
between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company or the Members
Representative, on the other hand, constitutes the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings and negotiations, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to such subject matter (except for the
Confidentiality Agreement between Buyer and the Company dated September 9,
2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full force
and effect). 

  

Section 10.8 _Construction; Interpretation_. The article, section and
subsection headings used herein are inserted for reference purposes only and
shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
As used in this Agreement, the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, and the
singular or plural, shall be deemed to include the others whenever
and wherever the context so requires. Unless the context of this Agreement
otherwise requires, (a) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, (b) the word
"including" shall mean "including, without limitation," and (c) the word "or"
shall be disjunctive but not exclusive. References to agreements and other
documents shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments and other
modifications thereto. References to statutes shall include all regulations
promulgated thereunder and references to statutes or regulations shall be
construed as including all statutory and regulatory provisions
consolidating, amending or replacing the statute or regulation. The language
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the
parties to express their mutual intent and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any party. Whenever this Agreement refers to a
number of days, such number shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days
are specified. All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined
herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP. 

  

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof to any circumstance shall, in any jurisdiction and to
any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, such term or provision shall be
ineffective as to such jurisdiction to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable such term
or provision in any other jurisdiction, the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement or the application of such terms and provisions to
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
enforceable. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 10.10 _Third Party Rights_. Except as set forth in Section 8.1 of
this Agreement, any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not create benefits on behalf of any
other Person not a party to this Agreement (including, without limitation,
any broker or finder), and this Agreement shall be effective only as among
the parties hereto, their successors and permitted assigns. 

  

Section 10.11 _Confidentiality_. All confidential information will be governed
by the Confidentiality Agreement, regardless whether or not a Closing shall
occur and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
consummated. 

  

Section 10.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement to the same extent as though fully set forth
herein ( _provided_ that in no event shall any information or disclosures in
the Disclosure Schedules be deemed or interpreted to broaden the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement). Information
contained in the Disclosure Schedules under any particular schedule or
section is deemed disclosed with respect to other schedules and sections only
where the applicability of such information to such other schedules and
sections is reasonably apparent on its face, regardless of whether a cross-
reference to the applicable schedule and/or section is actually made. Any
matter disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission
or representation as to the materiality of the item so disclosed, and matters
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules.
Nothing in the Disclosure Schedules constitutes an admission of any liability
or obligation of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of the Members to any
third party or shall confer or give to any third party any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right. 

  

Section 10.13 _Attorneys  Fees_. In the event of any dispute related to or
based upon this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
from the other party its reasonable attorneys fees and costs. 

  

Section 10.14 _Jurisdiction_. Except for the determination to be made pursuant
to Section 2.1(d)(3) of this Agreement, any controversy, claim or dispute
involving the parties (or their affiliated Persons) directly or indirectly
concerning this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, including, without
limitation, any issues and matters arising under the federal and
state securities laws and questions concerning the scope and applicability of
this Section 10.14 shall be brought in any federal or state court located in
the State of Delaware, and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding or action,
waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience
of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the proceeding or action shall
be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
proceeding or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve process
in any manner permitted by Applicable Law or to commence legal proceedings or
otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each
case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action, suit or proceeding brought
pursuant to this Section 10.14. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 10.15 _Retention of Counsel_. In any dispute or proceeding arising
under or in connection with this Agreement, the Members Representative and
the Members (collectively, the " _Selling Members_ ") shall have the right,
at their election, to retain the firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker
LLP to represent them in such matter, and Buyer, for itself, Merger Sub and
the Surviving Company and for Buyers, Merger Subs and the Surviving
Companys respective successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waives and
consents to any such representation in any such matter and the communication
by such counsel to the Selling Members regarding matters relating to or
arising from this Agreement of any fact known to such counsel arising by
reason of such counsels prior representation of the Selling Members or the
Company. Buyer, for itself, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company and for
Buyers, Merger Subs and the Surviving Companys respective successors and
assigns, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between
the Selling Members and counsel, including, without limitation,
Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker LLP, made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute or proceeding arising under or in connection with, this Agreement
which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of the Selling Members and their counsel and would not be
subject to disclosure to Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company in
connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing
to be privileged communications between the Selling Members and such counsel
and none of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or any Person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that
the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Company or the Surviving Company and not the Selling Members. Other than
as explicitly set forth in this Section 10.15, the parties acknowledge that
any attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of legal counsel
representing the Company prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and
continue to be a privilege of the Company, and not the Selling Members, after
the Closing.
