  Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option, for so long as this Agreement
  has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof (the &#147;<U>Top-Up
  Option</U>&#148;),
  to purchase from the Company up to the number of authorized and unissued shares
  of Company Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
  Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common
  Stock owned by Merger Sub and/or Parent at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
  Option, constitutes one share of Company Common Stock more than 90% of the
  then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, that would be
  outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of Company Common
  Stock subject to the Top-Up Option (such shares of Company Common Stock subject

  Acceptance Date, or if the Subsequent  Offering Period is made available, during
  the 10 business day period following the expiration date of the Subsequent
  Offering Period and only if Parent and/or Merger Sub shall own as of such time
  less than 90% of the outstanding shares of Company  Common Stock on a fully

notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable to the extent (A) the issuance of the shares of Company
  Common Stock upon exercise of  the Top-Up Option would require approval of
  the Company&#146;s
shareholders under Nasdaq rules, (B) the number of shares of Company  Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock or (C) any provision
of applicable Laws or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental
 Authority would prohibit, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization
or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental
Authority or the Company&#146;s
shareholders in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery
of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, which action, consent, approval,
authorization or permit, action, filing or notification has not theretofore been
obtained or made, as applicable. The aggregate purchase price payable for the
shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such shares
by the Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Merger Sub,
at its election, either entirely in cash or by paying in cash an amount equal
to not less than the aggregate par value of such shares and by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the balance of such purchase price. Any such promissory note shall bear interest
at the rate of 3% per annum, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date
of execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid without

  and such Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying
  Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms
  and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
  thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
  Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
  the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
