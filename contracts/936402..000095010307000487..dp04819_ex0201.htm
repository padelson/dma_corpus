  AGREEMENT OF MERGER

 

  This AGREEMENT  OF MERGER, dated as of February 20, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "),  is among Shire plc, a public limited company incorporated
under the laws of  England and Wales (" _Parent_ "), Shuttle Corporation, a
Virginia  corporation and an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and New River Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Virginia corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

 

  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company and
Merger Sub have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

  WHEREAS, it  is proposed that pursuant to this Agreement, and subject
to the terms and conditions  set forth herein, Parent will cause Merger Sub
to make a tender offer (as it  may be amended from time to time as permitted
by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding common
stock, par value $0.001  per share, of the Company (the " _Company_ _Common
Stock_ ") at a price per share of $64.00,  net to the seller in cash (such
amount, or any other amount per share of Company  Common Stock paid pursuant
to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

  WHEREAS, following  the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will
merge (the " _Merger_ ")  with and into the Company in accordance with the
Virginia Stock Corporation  Act of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the " _VSCA_
"), with the  Company surviving the merger as an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent,  and each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent or  Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or the  Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which will be cancelled with  no consideration issued in exchange therefor,
and other than Dissenting Shares)  will thereupon be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive cash in  an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

  WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company by a unanimous vote of
the directors present has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger are
advisable and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, (ii)
adopted and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance the requirements of the VSCA
and (iii) subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Merger by its shareholders;

 

  WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub
have adopted, approved and declared advisable, and Parent has caused the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub to approve, this Agreement providing for the Offer
and the Merger in accordance with the VSCA, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; and

 

  WHEREAS, as  an inducement to and condition to Parents willingness
to enter into this  Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company are
entering into a Tender and Support    
  
  

  Agreement with Parent simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement
in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Tender and
Support Agreement_ "),  whereby, among other things, such shareholders have
agreed, upon the terms  and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
tender the shares of Company  Common Stock held by them in the Offer and
support any and all corporate action necessary to consummate the Merger;

 

  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

 

  ARTICLE I 
  
  _THE OFFER_

 

  Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

  (a) Provided  that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
in accordance with Section  8.1 and that none of the events set forth in
Paragraph (2) of Annex I hereto  shall exist or have occurred and be
continuing, as promptly as practicable  after the date hereof, but in no
event later than March 2, 2007, Merger Sub  shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of  Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer to purchase any and all of the  outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock at the Offer Price. The obligations  of Merger Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment  and pay for shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall  be subject only to
the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). 
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions 
and to make any change in the terms of the Offer, except that without the
prior  written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) decrease the
Offer  Price or change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer,
(B) decrease  the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought pursuant to
the Offer,  (C) amend or waive the condition set forth in paragraph 1(a) of
Annex I, (D)  add to the conditions set forth on Annex I, (E) modify the
conditions set forth  in Annex I in a manner adverse to the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock,  (F) extend the Expiration Date (as defined in Annex
I) except as required or  permitted by this Section 1.1(a), or (G) make any
other change in the terms  or conditions of the Offer which is adverse to the
holders of shares of Company  Common Stock. The initial Expiration Date shall
be the twentieth business day  following (and including the day of) the
commencement of the Offer. If any  of the Offer Conditions is not satisfied
or waived on any scheduled Expiration  Date, if such Offer Condition(s) could
reasonably be expected to be satisfied,  Merger Sub shall extend the Offer
from time to time until such Offer Condition(s)  are satisfied or waived. Any
individual extension of the Offer pursuant to  the preceding sentence shall
not exceed 10 business days and in no event shall  the Offer extend beyond
the Walk-Away Date without the mutual written consent  of the Company and
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent  of the Company,
Merger Sub shall have the right to extend the Offer for any  period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the  SEC or the staff
thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by  applicable Law.
Following expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub may, in its sole  discretion,
provide a subsequent offering period (the " _Subsequent Offering Period_
") in

 

  2    
  
  

  accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act.  Subject to the
foregoing, and to the satisfaction, or waiver by Merger Sub,  of the Offer
Conditions as of the time of any scheduled expiration of the Offer,  Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment, as promptly  as
permitted under applicable securities laws, and pay for, as promptly as 
practicable after the date on which Merger Sub first accepts shares of
Company  Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance
Date_ "),  all shares of Company Common Stock (i) validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant  to the Offer and (ii) validly tendered in the Subsequent
Offering Period. Parent  shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub
on a timely basis funds  necessary to purchase all shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes  obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer
and Merger Sub shall maintain such funds exclusively for such purpose.

 

  (b) On the  date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger
Sub shall file with the  SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together  with all amendments and supplements thereto
and including exhibits thereto,  the " _Schedule TO_ ") that shall include
the summary term sheet  required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter  of transmittal (and appropriate ancillary
documents) and summary advertisement  (collectively, together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ")  and (ii) cause
the appropriate Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders  of shares of
Company Common Stock. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company  agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for inclusion in  the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information  shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Parent and Merger  Sub agree to use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Schedule TO as so corrected  to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated
to holders of shares of Company  Common Stock, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable U.S.  federal securities laws or the rules or
regulations of Nasdaq. Without limiting  the generality of the foregoing, the
Company will furnish to Parent the information  relating to the Company
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the  Offer Documents. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity  to review
and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time  before any
such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall  give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company 
and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel  with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral, that  Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time
from the  SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents
promptly  after receipt of those comments or other communications and (ii) a
reasonable  opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger
Sub to those  comments and to provide comments on that response (to which
reasonable and  good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating with Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC.

 

  Section 1.2 _Company Action_.

 

  (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that
its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held has unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its shareholders, (ii) adopted and approved

 

  3    
  
  

  this Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements  of the VSCA and
(iii) subject to Section 6.4, resolved to recommend acceptance  of the Offer
and approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by  its
shareholders. The Company has been advised that all of its directors and 
executive officers who own shares of Company Common Stock intend either to 
tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or to vote 
in favor of the Merger. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent with a
list  of its shareholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer file  containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
shares of Company  Common Stock and lists of securities positions of shares
of Company Common  Stock held in stock depositories, in each case true and
correct as of the most  recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent
such additional information  (including updated lists of shareholders,
mailing labels and lists of securities  positions) and such other assistance
as Parent may reasonably request in connection  with disseminating the Offer
Documents to the Companys shareholders.

 

  (b) As soon  as practicable on the day that the Offer is
commenced, the Company shall file  with the SEC and disseminate to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock,  in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable U.S. federal securities  laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with  any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to Section 6.4, shall reflect
the recommendations of the Companys Board of Directors referred to above.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The
Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws or the rules or regulations of Nasdaq.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with (i) any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments or other
communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including
by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC.

 

  (c) Prior to  the Expiration Date, the Compensation Committee of
the Companys Board  of Directors (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") shall
take all such actions as may be required to approve or ratify, as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within  the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, any and all
Compensation  Actions taken since March 1, 2006 (such date, the " _Specified_
_Date_ ")  and prior to the Expiration Date that have not already been so
approved or ratified.

  Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 

  (a) Effective  upon the purchase of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer,  Parent shall be entitled to designate the
number of directors, rounded up to  the next whole number, on the Companys
Board of Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of
directors on the Companys Board of Directors (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3(a)) and (ii)
the percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares of Company Common Stock
purchased pursuant to the Offer) bears to the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the
Companys Board of Directors, including increasing the number of directors,
and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time,
the Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on (i) each committee of the Companys Board of Directors
and (ii) each board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each
committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such individuals
represent on the Companys Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
until the Acceptance Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that all of the members of the Companys Board of Directors and such
committees and boards as of the date hereof who are not employees of the
Company remain members of the Companys Board of Directors and such
committees and boards until the Effective Time.

 

  (b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to
the Companys  Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and  Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions,  and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the  Company and its officers and directors, as
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require  in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section. Parent shall supply  to the Company in writing and be
solely responsible for any information with  respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1.

 

  (c) Following  the election or appointment of Parents designees
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a
majority of the directors of the Company then in office who were not
designated by Parent shall be required to authorize (and such authorization
shall constitute the authorization of the Companys Board of Directors and no
other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement,
any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by
Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, any exercise of
the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement or any action seeking
to enforce any obligation of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement.

  Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 

  (a)  Subject to Section 1.4(b) and Section 1.4(c) hereof, the
Company grants to  Parent and Merger Sub an irrevocable option, for so long
as this Agreement  has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof
(the " _Top-Up  Option_ "),  to purchase from the Company up to the number
of authorized and unissued shares  of Company Common Stock equal to the
number of shares of  Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common  Stock owned by Merger Sub and/or Parent at the time
of exercise of the Top-Up  Option, constitutes one share of Company Common
Stock more than 90% of the  then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
that would be  outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of
Company Common  Stock subject to the Top-Up Option (such shares of Company
Common Stock subject  to the Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up_ _Shares_ ").

 

  (b)  The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub,
in whole or in  part, only once, at any time during the 10 business day
period following the  Acceptance Date, or if the Subsequent Offering Period
is made available, during  the 10 business day period following the
expiration date of the Subsequent  Offering Period and only if Parent and/or
Merger Sub shall own as of such time  less than 90% of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock on a fully  diluted basis; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable to the extent (A) the issuance of the shares
of Company  Common Stock upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would require
approval of  the Companys shareholders under Nasdaq rules, (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option
would exceed the number of authorized but unissued shares of Company Common
Stock or (C) any provision of applicable Laws or any judgment, injunction,
order or decree of any Governmental  Authority would prohibit, or require any
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or the
Companys shareholders in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option
or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, which
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or
notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of Company Common Stock being
purchased by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such shares by the Offer Price. Such
purchase price may be paid by Parent or Merger Sub, at its election, either
entirely in cash or by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of such shares and by executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of
such purchase price. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate
of 3% per annum, shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of
execution and delivery of such promissory note and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty.

 

  (c) In the  event Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the
Top-Up Option, Parent or  Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice
(the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that
Parent or Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii)
the manner in which Parent or Merger Sub intends to pay the

 

  6    
  
  

  applicable exercise price and (iii) the place and time at which the closing
of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by Parent or Merger Sub is to take
place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an undertaking signed by Parent
and Merger Sub that, as promptly as practicable following such exercise of
the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub intends to (and Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise)
consummate the Merger in accordance with Article 12, Section 13.1 -719 of the
VSCA as contemplated by Section 6.16. At the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares,
and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub (as the case
may be) a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed
received by the Company pursuant to Section 9.10, and if not so consummated on
such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with Article 12, Section 13.1 -719 of the VSCA as contemplated by
Section 6.16 as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent
possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

 

  (d) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Top-Up Shares will
not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon
an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-Up
Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Parent or Merger
Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale
in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any
legends required by applicable securities laws.

  ARTICLE III

 

  _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT_ 
  _CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

  Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.  At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the  part of the Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any shares of Company  Common Stock or of any
shares of common stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger
Sub Common Stock_ "):

 

  (a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of Merger Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  (b) _Cancellation of Subsidiary-Owned and Parent-Owned Company_
_Common Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

  (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.  Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with  Section 3.1(b) and
shares for which the holders thereof properly demanded appraisal  as provided
in Section 3.4) shall be converted into the right to receive the  Offer Price
in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").  As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no  longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to  exist,
and each holder of a certificate (or, in the case of uncertificated  shares,
evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior to the 
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
Section 3.2(b), without interest.

 

  Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

  (a) _Paying Agent_.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a national bank or trust  company (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
reasonably acceptable to the  Company for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates into the right to receive  the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(c) . Parent shall deposit  such aggregate Merger Consideration
with the Paying Agent at or prior to the  Effective Time. Such aggregate
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying  Agent may, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying  Agent as directed by
Parent in (i) direct obligations of the United States  of America, (ii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United  States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality

 

  9    
  
  

  by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors  Ratings
Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination  of the
foregoing. Any interest or income produced by such investments will  be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Any
portion  of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to  this Section 3.2(a) to pay for shares of Company Common Stock
for which appraisal rights have been properly demanded shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

 

  (b) _Payment Procedures_.  As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event  more than five business days
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause  the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter  of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk  of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the  Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall  have such other
customary provisions (including customary provisions with respect  to
delivery of an "agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry
form) as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying  Agent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the  surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.  Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together 
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance  with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may
reasonably  be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled  to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
promptly pay to such  holder, in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration,
without interest, for  each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate  and such Certificate so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Paying  Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms  and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange  thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment of the Merger  Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name  the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment  that (x) the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall  otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such  payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of  the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered  holder of such
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable 
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid 
or is not required to be paid. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the 
case may be, in accordance with this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall
represent  after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger  Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.

 

  (c) _Transfer Books_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates,
and from and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.2(e), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any

 

  10    
  
  

  reason, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for
in this ARTICLE III, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth
herein.

 

  (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this ARTICLE III.

 

  (e) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.2(a)
and any interest received with respect thereto that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Common Stock for nine months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and thereafter any holders of
Company Common Stock who have not complied with this Section 3.2 prior to the
end of such nine-month period shall be entitled to look only to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at
which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

  (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving
Corporation, any of their respective Affiliates or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

  (g) _Withholding Taxes_.  Each of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled  to deduct and withhold
(without duplication) from the consideration otherwise  payable to a holder
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement  such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to  the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "),  or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, and Parent, the  Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall provide to the former holders  of
Company Common Stock written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld. 
To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental  Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement  as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

  Section 3.3 _Company Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights_.

 

  11    
  
  

  (a) _Company Stock Options_.  At the Effective Time, all options
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock  outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time granted by the Company  under any Company Stock Plan
(each, an " _Option_ "), whether  or not fully vested and exercisable, shall
be cancelled and each holder of  an Option shall be paid in full satisfaction
of such Option, a cash amount  equal to the Option Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock then  subject to the Option, subject to
applicable withholding Taxes. For purposes  of this Agreement, " _Option
Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of Company Common Stock
issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
(i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii) the
exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock
issuable under such Option. Promptly (and in no event more than three business
days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall make or cause the Surviving
Corporation to make the cash payments to be made to holders of Options
pursuant to this Section 3.3(a) . For purposes of this Agreement, an "Option"
does not include the Merrill Warrants.

 

  (b) _Company Stock Appreciation Rights_.  At the Effective Time,
all stock appreciation rights outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective
Time with respect to shares of Company Common Stock,  whether or not granted
under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _SAR_ "),  and whether or not fully
vested and exercisable, shall be cancelled and each  holder of a SAR shall be
paid in full satisfaction of such SAR, a cash amount  equal to the SAR
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then  subject to the
SAR, subject to applicable withholding Taxes. For purposes of  this
Agreement, " _SAR Consideration_ " means, with respect to  each share of
Company Common Stock subject to a particular SAR, an amount equal  to the
excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company  Common
Stock over (ii) the strike price of such SAR in respect of such share  of
Company Common Stock related to such SAR. Promptly (and in no event more 
than three business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall make or
cause  the Surviving Corporation to make the cash payments to be made to
holders of SARs pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) .

 

  (c) If the Company, in consultation with Parent, determines that
the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3 require the consent of
holders of Options or SARs or any amendments to the terms of any Company
Stock Plan or related award documents, then prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consents or make
any such amendments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, payment pursuant to this Section 3.3 may be withheld in respect
of any Option or SAR until any such consent so determined by the Company to be
required has been obtained.

 

  Section 3.4 _Dissenters  Shares_.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares  of Company Common Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time and which are
held by shareholders who shall not have voted or caused  or permitted any of
their shares to be voted in favor of the Merger and who  shall have properly
demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with the  VSCA to the extent
entitled thereto (collectively, the " _Dissenters  Shares_")  shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, 
and such shareholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised  value of such shares held by them in accordance with the
provisions of the  VSCA; _provided_ that all Dissenters Shares held by
shareholders who shall have failed to

 

  12    
  
  

  perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their
rights to appraisal of such shares under the VSCA shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the
Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates in the manner provided
in Section 3.2 hereof that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, evidenced
such shares.

 

  Section 3.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
ARTICLE III to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class or there
is a change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights convertible or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the cash payable
pursuant to the Offer, the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration and
the SAR Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse  Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse
Effect_ " shall  mean any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, development,
circumstance or  occurrence (each, an " _Effect_ ") that, individually or

  13    
  
  

  Agreement, provided, however, that in no event  shall any of the
following, either alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute,  nor
shall any of the following be taken into account in determining whether 
there has been or will be, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (1) changes in 
conditions in the United States or global economy or capital or financial
markets  generally, including changes in interest or exchange rates, (2)

shall not prevent or otherwise affect  a determination that any Effect
underlying such change has resulted in, or  contributed to, a Company
Material Adverse Effect), (5) acts of war, sabotage  or terrorism, or any
escalation or worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage  or terrorism, (6)

Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or in accordance with either  of
the Collaboration Agreements or with Parents written consent, (8) 
shareholder litigation alleging a breach of fiduciary duty in connection
with  this Agreement or the Transactions taken by itself (provided that the

the composition of  the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section
1.3(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to clauses (1), (2) and

other comparable companies and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

 

  (b) The Company  has made available to Parent complete and

Meeting_ "), (ii) except to the extent that the Companys Board of Directors
has effected or effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change prior to the
Acceptance Date in accordance with the terms of Section 6.4, include in the
Company Proxy Statement the Merger Recommendation and the written opinion of
the Financial Advisors, dated as of the date hereof, to the extent set
forth in Section 4.19 and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from holders of shares of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and take all other action necessary or advisable
to secure, at the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company Shareholder
Approval.

 

  (b) Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Article
12, Section 13.1 -719 of the VSCA as contemplated by Section 6.16, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Date, or if the Subsequent
Offering Period is made available, following the expiration date of the
Subsequent Offering Period, the Company shall (i) prepare and file with the
SEC the Company Proxy Statement, (ii) mail to its shareholders the Company
Proxy Statement a sufficient time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting
and (iii) otherwise comply in all material respects with all legal
requirements applicable to the Company Shareholders Meeting. Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in the
preparation of the Company Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish as soon as
reasonably practicable to the Company the information relating to it required
by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be
set forth in the Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to resolve all SEC comments (in consultation with Parent)
with respect to the Company Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after
receipt

 

  43    
  
  

  thereof and to cause the Company Proxy Statement  to be mailed to the
Companys shareholders as promptly as practicable  after the Company Proxy
Statement is cleared with the SEC. Each of Parent,  Merger Sub and the
Company agree to correct as soon as reasonably practicable  any information
provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which  shall have
become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective  Time, any
information should be discovered by any party which should be set  forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement so that  the
Company Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material 
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading,  the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other  parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate  amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed  by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company
to the shareholders  of the Company. The Company shall as promptly as
practicable (i) notify Parent  and Merger Sub of the receipt of any oral or
written comments from the SEC  with respect to the Company Proxy Statement
and any request by the SEC for  any amendment to the Company Proxy Statement
or for additional information  and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all
written correspondence between the  Company and its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy
Statement.

 

  (c) At the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent shall vote, and
cause each of its Subsidiaries to vote, all shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, including all shares of Company Common
Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer in favor of the adoption and approval of
this Agreement, the related Plan of Merger and the Merger.

 

  Section 6.2 _Parent Shareholder Meeting_.  Parent shall cause a
general meeting of its shareholders (such meeting, and  any postponement or
adjournment thereof, the " _Parent_ _Shareholder Meeting_ ") to be duly called
and held as promptly as practicable for the purpose of securing the Parent
Shareholder Approvals. The Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend that
Parents shareholders grant the Parent Shareholder Approvals and include such
recommendation in the Parent Shareholder Circular and shall not fail to make,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company or publicly propose to
fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company the Parent
Board Recommendation or take any action or make any statement inconsistent
with the Parent Board Recommendation (any such action, including failing to
initially recommend that Parents shareholders grant the Parent Shareholder
Approvals, being referred to as a " _Change in Parent Recommendation_ "). In
connection with the Parent Shareholder Meeting, Parent shall (i) as promptly
as practicable prepare and then, if required, file with the UK Listing
Authority a draft copy of, shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
approved, if required, by the UK Listing Authority and shall thereafter
promptly mail to its shareholders, the Parent Shareholder Circular, (ii) use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the Parent Shareholder Approvals and
(iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such
meeting. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Parent Shareholder Meeting, the Board of Directors of
Parent may if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel to Parent, that it must take such
action to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, make a
Change in Parent Recommendation. After any Change in Parent Recommendation
shall have occurred in compliance with the immediately

 

  44    
  
  

  preceding sentence, Parent shall not have any further obligations under
this Section 6.2 which shall thereafter be without any further force or
effect.

 

  Section 6.3 _Conduct of Business_.

 

  (a) Except (i) as contemplated or expressly permitted by this
Agreement, (ii) for actions taken in accordance with either of the
Collaboration Agreements, (iii) as required by applicable Law or (iv) as
contemplated by Section 6.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, unless Parent
otherwise consents in writing, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, conduct their businesses in the ordinary course and comply
with all applicable Laws in all material respects, and, to the extent
consistent therewith, use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact their
present business organizations, keep available the services of their present
executive officers, key employees and consultants and preserve their
relationships with customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors
and others having business dealings with them with the intention that their
goodwill and ongoing business shall not be materially impaired and to take no
action that would adversely affect or delay in any material respect the
ability of either Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to obtain any necessary
approvals of any Governmental Authority required for the Transactions.

 

  (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except (1)
as contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, (2) for actions taken in

  Section 6.4 _No Solicitation_.

 

  (a) _General Prohibitions_.  Subject to Section 6.4(b), the
Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or  permit any of its Subsidiaries
or any of its or their respective directors,  officers or employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants  or other
advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") 
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or 
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or 
is reasonably likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (ii) other than solely 
informing Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 6.4, enter
into  or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal,  furnish to any Third Party any information (whether
orally or in writing) in  connection with, or in furtherance, of any Takeover
Proposal, or afford access  to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries, otherwise cooperate in
any way with, or knowingly assist,  participate in, facilitate or encourage
any effort by, any Third Party that  has made, is seeking to make or has
informed the Company of any intention to  make, or has publicly announced an
intention to make, a Takeover Proposal,  (iii) fail to make, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or publicly  propose to withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Offer Recommendation  or Merger
Recommendation (it being understood that, subject to and without  limitation
of Section 6.4(g), taking a neutral position or no position with  respect to
any Takeover Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification), 
recommend, adopt or approve, or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or
approve,  a Takeover Proposal, or take any action or make any statement
inconsistent  with the Offer Recommendation or Merger Recommendation (any of
the foregoing  in this clause (iii), a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), (iv) take any action not already taken to make the
provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
(including approving any transaction under, or a Third Party becoming an
"interested shareholder" under, Article 14 (Affiliated Transactions) of the
VSCA), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision
in the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Takeover Proposal, (v) enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar instrument

 

49    
  
  

  constituting or relating to a Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement of the type referred to in Section 6.4(b)) or (vi)
grant any Third Party any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be a breach of this Section by the Company.

 

  (b) _Exception to Permit Discussions, Due Diligence, Etc. after
Receipt_ _of Certain Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything that may be to the
contrary herein, at  any time prior to the Acceptance Date (and in no event
after the Acceptance  Date), the Board of Directors of the Company, directly
or indirectly through  advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may, subject
to compliance with Section  6.4(c), (i) engage in negotiations or discussions
with any Third Party that  has made after the date of this Agreement a
Superior Proposal or a bona fide  Takeover Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in  good faith (after considering the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally  recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel) may be reasonably likely to  lead to the receipt of a
Superior Proposal and the making of such Superior  Proposal or such Takeover
Proposal did not result from a material breach of  Section 6.4(a); (ii)
thereafter, furnish to such Third Party nonpublic information  relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality 
agreement with terms overall no less favorable to the Company than those
contained  in the Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
November 28,  2006, between Parent and the Company and the other party named
therein (as  it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality_
_Agreement_ ")  (a copy of which shall, subject to Section 6.4(c), be
provided, promptly after  its execution, for informational purposes only to
Parent, and which copy and  the terms and existence thereof shall be subject
to the confidentiality obligations  imposed on Parent pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement), _provided_ , that, subject to Section 6.4(c), all
such information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided or made or had been previously made available to Parent) is provided
or made or had been previously made available to Parent, as the case may be,
prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made
available to such Third Party), and _provided_ , _further_ , that if such
Superior Proposal or Takeover Proposal is made by a Third Party who or which,
on the date hereof, is party to a confidentiality agreement with the Company
which would prohibit the Company from complying with any of the terms of this
Section 6.4(b) or Section 6.4(c) requiring the provision by the Company of
information, agreements or the documents to Parent, then the Company may take
the actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.4(b) only if
such confidentiality agreement with such Third Party has been amended (and the
Company shall be permitted to amend such confidentiality agreement) to allow
the Company to fully comply with such terms of this Section 6.4(b) and Section
6.4(c) without violating such confidentiality agreement; and (iii) following
receipt of a Superior Proposal after the date of this Agreement and subject
to compliance with Section 6.4(d), (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and (y) terminate this Agreement (A) upon the concurrent payment of the
termination fee contemplated by Section 8.3(a) and (B) substantially
concurrent entry into a definitive agreement implementing such Superior
Proposal, but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iii) only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
by a majority vote, after considering advice from outside legal counsel to
the Company, that its failure

 

  50    
  
  

  to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

  (c) _Required Notices._ The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of
Section 6.4(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action, and the
Company shall continue to advise Parent after taking such action of the status
and terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Takeover Proposal or of any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that may be considering making, or has made, a Takeover Proposal, which
notice shall be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Third
Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal,
indication or request (including any changes thereto). The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the status and
details of any such Takeover Proposal, indication or request (including any
material changes thereto) and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence and
written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that describe the material terms and conditions of any Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.4(c) or the
provisions of Section 6.4(b), but without limitation of the further proviso in
Section 6.4(b), the Company shall not be required to provide Parent with the
information, agreements or other documents described in such provisions to
the extent that doing so would violate the terms of any confidentiality
agreement to which the Company is a party on the date hereof.

 

  (d) _Company Ability to Change Recommendation and Terminate_
_Agreement  Subject to a "Last Look"_. Notwithstanding the last sentence of
Section 6.4(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not take an action
described in clause (iii) of Section 6.4(b) unless (i) the Company promptly
notifies Parent, in writing at least three business days before taking that
action, of its intention to do so in response to a Takeover Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of any
proposed agreement or a detailed summary of the material terms of any such
proposal and the identity of the offeror, and (ii) Parent does not make,
within such three-business-day period, an offer that is at least as favorable
to the shareholders of the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors
of the Company in good faith (after considering the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation), as such Superior Proposal (it
being understood that the Company shall not take any action described in
clause (iii) of Section 6.4(b) during such three-business-day period, and
that any material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from the
Company and an additional three-business-day period).

 

  (e) _Definitions of Takeover Proposal and Superior Proposal_. For
purposes of this Agreement:

 

  51    
  
  

  " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Third Party relating to any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries of the Company) equal to
20% or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of
the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable,
(B) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock or
any other voting securities of the Company, (C) tender offer (including a
self-tender offer) or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Third Party beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or any other voting securities of the Company or (D) merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company, in each
case other than the Transactions.

 

  " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal (on its
most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a
Third Party to enter into a Takeover Proposal (with all of the percentages
included in the definition of Takeover Proposal increased to 75%), and which
is otherwise on terms and conditions which the Board of Directors of the
Company determines by a majority vote in its good faith (after consultation
with a financial advisor of national reputation and outside counsel) and in
light of all relevant circumstances and all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, to be more favorable
to the Companys shareholders than the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions and for which financing, if a cash transaction (in whole or in
part), is then committed or determined by the Companys Board of Directors to
be reasonably likely to be obtained.

 

  (f) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated
any and all existing soliciting activities, discussions or negotiations and
non-public information access, if any, with or to any Third Party conducted
prior to the date hereof with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall promptly request that each Third Party, if any, in possession of the
confidential information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was
furnished by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with its consideration of any potential Takeover Proposal to return
or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Third
Party.

 

  (g) _Certain Limited Exceptions_.  Nothing in this Section 6.4
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the  Board of Directors of the
Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys  shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)  of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other applicable Law,  if such Board
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure  to so
disclose such position could constitute a violation of applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that any such disclosure relating to a Takeover
Proposal, other than (i) a "stop, look and listen" or  similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated  under the Exchange
Act, (ii) an express rejection of such Takeover Proposal,  or (iii) an
express reaffirmation of its Offer Recommendation and Merger

  52    
  
  

  Company Adverse Recommendation Change. In addition,  it is understood and
agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement (including  ARTICLE VIII), a
factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes  the
Companys receipt of a Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto  shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company  affirmatively reaffirms in such disclosure the Offer
Recommendation and Merger Recommendation.

 

  Section 6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do,
or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents
(including any required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust
Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions; _provided_ that
in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required by this Section 6.5 or
any other provision of this Agreement to (A) license, divest, dispose of or
hold separate any material portion of the assets or businesses of Parent or
the Company or any of their respective material Subsidiaries or otherwise take
or commit to take any action that limits in any respect its freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, any material portion of the assets
or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective material
Subsidiaries, or that would have a material adverse effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) taken as a whole after
giving effect to the Transactions, (B) agree to or effect any license,
divestiture, disposition or hold separate any business or take any other
action or agree to any limitation that is not conditioned on the consummation
of the Merger or (C) pay any significant amounts in connection with seeking or
obtaining such consents, approvals or authorizations as are required to
complete the Transactions under applicable Antitrust Laws (excluding any
mandatory filing fees and reasonable and customary costs and expenses
associated with making applications for, and responding to requests for
information from Governmental Authorities with respect to, such required
consents, approvals or authorizations); _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company (x) shall not take or agree to take any action identified in clause
(A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence without the
prior written consent of Parent and (y) if so requested by Parent, shall use
reasonable best efforts to effect any license, divestiture or disposition of,
or hold separate, any of the Companys assets or businesses necessary to
obtain clearances or approvals required for the Closing under the Antitrust
Laws, provided that such action is conditioned on the consummation of the
Merger and does not reduce the amount or delay the payment of the Offer
Price, Merger Consideration, Option Consideration or SAR Consideration
payable in connection with the Transactions. For purposes hereof, "
_Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other applicable Laws issued by a United States federal or state Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict

 

  53    
  
  

  or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 

  (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i)
each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) business days of the
date hereof, and to supply promptly any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with
this Section 6.5 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and (ii)
the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take
all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law
is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state
takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement, and use reasonable best efforts to otherwise minimize the effect
of such Law on the Transactions.

 

  (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate
in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission
with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party and (ii) keep the other party informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or any other
Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each of the parties hereto shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the other parties and their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties may designate
certain of such filings, or certain information contained therein, as being
provided on an outside counsel basis only. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, applications, investigation, or
other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior notice of the
meeting and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend and participate (which, at the request of any of the
parties, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).

 

  (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 6.5, each of the parties hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
Transactions. Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the

 

  54    
  
  

  consummation of the Transactions, on or before the Walk-Away Date,
including by defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
any court by any Person and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the consummation of the
Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event by no
later than the Walk-Away Date).

 

  (e) Without limiting any other provision hereof, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to file or transmit, as applicable, such
notices, letters, instruments and the like with or to the FDA, U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office, U.S. Copyright Office and all foreign counterparts to
each of the foregoing relating to the Transactions as may required to comply
with all applicable Laws, and, subject to the occurrence of the Effective
Time, to vest all right, title, and interest in the Company Technology in
Parent effective as of the Effective Time.

 

  Section 6.6 _Certain Filings_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate
with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the
Company Disclosure Documents and the Offer Documents, (ii) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions and (iii) in taking such actions or
making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith or with the Company Disclosure Documents or the Offer Documents and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 

  Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company have agreed
upon the form and substance of the press release to be issued by Parent, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, announcing the execution of
this Agreement and the Transactions, which shall be issued promptly following
the execution and delivery hereof. Other than with respect to such press
releases, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other and consider
in good faith the views of the other party before issuing any press release or
making any other public statement, or scheduling any press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by
applicable Law, order of a court of competent jurisdiction or any listing
agreement with or rule of any applicable securities exchange or association,
shall not issue any such press release or make any such other public statement
or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such
consultation.

 

  Section 6.8 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.  Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company  shall
afford to Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
books, Contracts, personnel and records and the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws to the extent copies of such reports, schedules and
other documents are not accessible via the SECs EDGAR database, (ii) other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as Parent or any of its Representatives may reasonably request; and
(iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial

 

  55    
  
  

  advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives to cooperate with
Parent in its investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access if the Company
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable
Law or a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party or
jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege. The information
provided will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.8 or information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement (other than,
subject to Section 9.8, information contained in the Company Disclosure
Schedule) will affect any of the representations or warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the obligations of
the parties hereto.

 

  Section 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.  The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt  notice to the
Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by  such party
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions  or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required  in
connection with the Transactions, and (b) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations  or proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge,
threatened against,  such party or any of its Subsidiaries and relating to
the Transactions. In  addition, prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company
shall give prompt notice  to Parent of any inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty of the Company  contained in this Agreement, or any failure of
the Company to materially comply  with any covenant or agreement of the
Company set forth herein, at any time  during the term of this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to cause  the Offer Conditions set forth in
clause 2(c) or (d) of _Annex I_ not to be satisfied or reasonably be expected
to give rise to a termination right pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i); _provided_
, _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving that notice.

 

  Section 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

  (a) From and  after the Acceptance Date and until the Effective
Time, the Company shall,  and Parent shall cause the Company to, and from and
after the Effective Time,  Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) indemnify and  hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time  prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of  a Subsidiary of the Company (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or
in part, acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or
taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in
connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Person (including any
employee benefit plan)), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the Transactions),
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in
respect of

 

  56    
  
  

  indemnification and exculpation from liabilities  for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided  in the Companys
articles of incorporation and bylaws and the organizational documents of
such Subsidiaries, in each case, as currently in effect, which shall survive
the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Acceptance Date and until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Company to, and from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (or any successor) to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws, which provisions shall not be, except as required by
applicable Law, amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition,
subject to Section 6.10(b), from and after the Acceptance Date and until the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, and
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance any expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee incurred in connection with
matters for which this Section 6.10 may apply (including in connection with
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
6.10) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances to the extent required by applicable Law. Unless
Parent and the Surviving Corporation otherwise determine that the Indemnitees
conduct complied with such applicable standards, any determination required to
be made with respect to whether an Indemnitees conduct complies with the
standards set forth under applicable Law, the Companys articles of
incorporation or bylaws, the organizational documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall be made in the manner
described in Section 6 of Article VI of the Company\'s articles of
incorporation as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that with
regard to acts or omissions of a Continuing Indemnitee occurring after the
Acceptance Date and prior to the Effective Time, any determination as to
whether the applicable standard of conduct was met shall be made by special
legal counsel agreed upon by the Company\'s Board of Directors (excluding the
Continuing Indemnitee) and the Continuing Indemnitee, unless Parent and the
Surviving Corporation otherwise determine that the Continuing
Indemnitees conduct complied with such applicable standards. If the
Company\'s Board of Directors (excluding the Continuing Indemnitee) and the
Continuing Indemnitee are unable to agree on such special legal counsel the
Company\'s Board of Directors (excluding the Continuing Indemnitee) and the
Continuing Indemnitee each shall select a nominee, and the nominees shall
select such special legal counsel.

 

  (b) The Indemnitees may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with the Company (if after the Acceptance Date and
prior to the Effective Time), and Parent (if on or after the Effective Time);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (w) the Company (if after the Acceptance Date
and prior to the Effective Time) or Parent or the Surviving Corporation (if
on or after the Effective Time) shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof (provided the Company or Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, each confirm in writing to the Indemnitee their obligations to
indemnify such party), and upon such assumption, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall not be liable to any Indemnitee, and shall not be

 

  57    
  
  

  obligated to advance any expenses to any Indemnitee pursuant to Section
6.10(a), for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof, except that
if the Company or Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, elect
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnitees reasonably advises
the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Company or Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, on the one hand, and the Indemnitees, on the other hand, the
Indemnitees may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after
consultation with the Company or Parent, as applicable, and the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnitees; _provided_ that in such case (x) the Company or
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be obligated
pursuant to this Section 6.10 to pay for only one firm or counsel for all
Indemnified Parties, unless the proposed counsel for the Indemnified Parties
reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are issues that raise
conflicts of interest among such parties, in which case the Company or Parent,
as applicable, shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of additional
counsel to the extent necessary to avoid such conflict and (y) the Company or
Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any Indemnitee wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 6.10, upon learning of any claim or
proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 6.10,
shall notify the Company (if after the Acceptance Date and prior to the
Effective Time), or Parent and the Surviving Corporation (if on or after the
Effective Time) thereof, provided, that the failure to so notify shall not
affect the obligations of the Company or Parent, as applicable, under this
Section 6.10, except to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices the Company or Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable.

 

  (c) By no later  than the Acceptance Date, the Company shall
obtain and fully pay (up to a maximum  cost of 300% of the current annual
premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries  for their existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage in the aggregate) for a
tail policy of directors and officers liability insurance (with a policy
limit and coverage no greater than such existing directors and officers
liability insurance coverage) in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Acceptance Date (and with respect to Continuing Indemnitees, in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time)
covering each Indemnitee for a period of six years following the Acceptance
Date (and with respect to Continuing Indemnitees, six years following the
Effective Time) with an insurance carrier nationally recognized in the United
States of America; _provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable
opportunity to participate in selection of such tail policy and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent with respect thereto. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to maintain such tail policy. In the
event that any Indemnitee is entitled to coverage under an directors and
officers liability insurance policy pursuant to this Section 6.10(c) and
such policy has lapsed, terminated, been repudiated or is otherwise in breach
or default as a result of Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any of
their Affiliates failure to maintain and fulfill its obligations pursuant to
such policy, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
to the Indemnitee such amounts and provide any other coverage or benefits as
the Indemnitee shall have been otherwise entitled to have received pursuant
to such policy. Parent agrees that, should the Surviving Corporation fail to
comply with the obligations of this

 

  58    
  
  

  Section 6.10(c), Parent shall be responsible therefor.  For those
Indemnitees who are directors or officers of the Company on the Acceptance 
Date and who continue to be directors or officers of the Company at any time 
during the period from the Acceptance Date until the Effective Time ("
_Continuing Indemnitees_ "), the tail policy described above shall provide, or
at the Companys election Parent shall provide, such Continuing Indemnitees
with directors and officers liability insurance coverage in respect of acts
or omissions occurring on or after the Acceptance Date and prior to the
Effective Time, with a carrier of national recognition, and having terms at
least as favorable to each such Indemnitee with respect to such matters as
those provided to each such Indemnitee under the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

  (d) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Company,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.10 shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.10 applies unless (x) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
Section 6.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10)
.

 

  (e) In the event that the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.10.

 

  Section 6.11 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 8.3,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

 

  Section 6.12 _Employee Matters_.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted as limiting the power of Parent  and its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation, from and after the  Effective Time, to amend or
terminate any employee benefit plan, program, contract  or arrangement in
accordance with its terms (subject to Parents and the Surviving
Corporations  obligations under Section 3.3) or to continue the employment
of any employee  of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who were employees
of the Company  or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company Employee_ "); _provided_ that if Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent should terminate the employment of a Company Employee, he
or she shall be entitled to the severance benefits, including severance
payments, medical benefits continuation and outplacement services according to
the schedule previously disclosed to the Company. Without limiting the
generality of Section 9.6, nothing in this Section 6.12, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the parties

 

  59    
  
  

  hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 6.12.

 

  Section 6.13 _Voting of Shares of Parent Capital Stock_. The Company
shall cause the votes attaching to the ordinary shares of Parent beneficially
owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries to be cast in favor of approval of the
Parent Voting Proposals at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.

 

  Section 6.14 _Nasdaq De-listing; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable
the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from
Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange
Act promptly after the Effective Time.

 

  Section 6.15 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other
actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate with the other party in
making any determination or computation necessary or appropriate with respect
to the Convertible Notes, the Merrill Warrants, the Company Hedge Option and
the Forward Transaction, including with respect to any cash amounts or shares
of Company Common Stock that may be receivable, issuable, deliverable or
payable by the Company pursuant to the Indenture and any instrument
representing the Convertible Notes, the Warrant Confirmations, the Company
Hedge Option Confirmations and the Forward Confirmation.

 

  Section 6.16 _Merger Without Meeting of Shareholders_. If, after the
consummation of the Offer and any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub
collectively represent at least 90% of the then outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and the Company shall execute
and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as

  date of execution and delivery of such promissory  note and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty) cash amounts which the  Company may request from
time to time be lent to it by Parent for purposes  of funding amounts which

Agreement and the Transactions (including related fees and expenses),  (b)

in the Indenture) for each $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes
surrendered for conversion) and (c) the settlement upon "Cancellation and

transfer of same-day funds to an account previously designated by the Company
to the Parent. The Company shall use the proceeds of the Parent Financing
solely for the purposes provided in this Section 6.18. The existence of the
Parent Financing shall not constitute a breach or violation of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company
contained herein. If the Company has the right to make an election as to the
form of consideration to be paid to the holders of the Convertible Notes or
Merrill Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Indenture or Warrant

>  

 

  62    
  
  

>  
>
>   action or failure to act of Parent, and such action or failure to act
> constitutes a breach by Parent of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,

>
>  

 

  (c) by Parent:

 

>  
>
>   (i) if prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall have breached
> or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or

> (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Paragraph

> cured by the Company by  the earlier of (x) 30 days following receipt by
> the Company of written notice of such breach or failure and (y) the Walk-
> Away Date; _provided_ , at the time of the delivery of such written

representations and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate at
the Effective Time.

 

  Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and
all respects, whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval or Parent Shareholder Approvals, by written agreement of the parties
hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that following approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company and Parent, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions
hereof which by applicable Law would require further approval by the
shareholders of the Company or Parent, respectively.

 

  Section 9.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc._ At  any time prior to
the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable  Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any  other party
hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations  or
acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party 
with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided 
herein, waive any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any 
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial  exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise  of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to  any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument  in writing signed on behalf of such party. The rights
and remedies herein provided  shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by applicable Law.

 

  Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that

and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
Section 9.4 shall be null and void.

 

  Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall
become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

 

  Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the exhibits
hereto, the documents and instruments relating to the Transactions referred
to herein, and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement,
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,

 

  66    
  
  

  among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the

among any of the parties as to the interpretation of any provision of, or the
performance of obligations under, this Agreement shall be commenced and
prosecuted in its entirety solely in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia and any reviewing appellate court thereof. If the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, or
any reviewing appellate court thereof, finds that it does not have
jurisdiction over the dispute or disagreement, then and only then can the
parties proceed in state court and the parties hereby agree that any such
dispute will only be brought in state court in Richmond, Virginia. Each party
consents to personal and subject matter jurisdiction and venue in such
Virginia federal or state courts (as the case may be) and waives and
relinquishes all right to attack the suitability or convenience of such venue
or forum by reason of their present or future domiciles, or for any other
reason. The parties acknowledge that all directions issued by the forum court,
including all injunctions and other decrees, will be binding and enforceable
in all jurisdictions and countries. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in
Section 9.10 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

  (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

  Section 9.8 _Company Disclosure Schedule References; Company SEC_
_Documents_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to
the contrary (including the lead-in to ARTICLE IV hereof):

 

  (a) any reference in a particular Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) the Company that
are contained in this Agreement, but only, in each case, if the relevance of
that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) would be apparent
from a reasonable reading thereof to a reasonable person without independent
knowledge of the

 

  67    
  
  

  matters so disclosed. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 

  (b) in no event  shall any information contained in any section
of any Company SEC Document  entitled "Risk Factors" be deemed to be an
exception to (or, as applicable,  a disclosure for purposes of) any
representation and warranty (or covenant,  as applicable) of the Company that
is contained in this Agreement, except to the extent such information
consists of factual historical statements ( _e.g._ , factual descriptions of
the performance, results of operations, assets, liabilities or financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries); and

 

  (c) in no event shall any other information contained in any
Company SEC Document be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) any representation and warranty (or covenant, as
applicable) of the Company that is contained in this Agreement, except to the
extent that such information constitutes factual historical statements (
_e.g._ , factual descriptions of the performance, results of operations,
assets, liabilities or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
which shall, in each case, for the sake of clarity, exclude all subjective
opinions or judgments of management and all forward-looking statements).

 

  Section 9.9 _Specific Enforcement_.  The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any  of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their  specific terms or
were otherwise breached (and, more specifically, that irreparable  damage
would occur if the Transactions were not consummated and the Companys
shareholders did not receive the Merger Consideration or the Offer Price or
the holders of the Options and the SARs did not receive the Option
Consideration or SAR Consideration, respectively, in accordance with the terms
but subject to the conditions of this Agreement). It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including the parties obligation to
consummate the Transactions and Parents obligation to pay, and the Companys
shareholders, the holders of Options and the holders of the SARs right to
receive, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration, the Option
Consideration or the SAR Consideration, as the case may be, pursuant to the
Transactions, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement) in any court specified in Section 9.7(b), without bond or other
security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at Law or in equity.

 

  Section 9.10 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications
to any party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given

  Exhibit A-1    
  
 

TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This Tender and Support Agreement  dated as of February 20, 2007 (this
"Agreement")  is among each of the individuals or entities listed on a
signature page hereto  (each, a "Shareholder")  and Shire plc, a public
limited company incorporated under the laws of England  and Wales
("Parent").  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
assigned  to them in the Agreement of Merger dated as of the date of this
Agreement  (including the related Plan of Merger, together with any
amendments or supplements  thereto, the "Merger Agreement")  among Parent,
Shuttle Corporation, a Virginia corporation and a wholly owned  subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger  Sub"), and New River Pharmaceuticals  Inc., a Virginia
corporation (the "Company").

 

Each Shareholder beneficially  owns the shares of common stock of the
Company, par value $0.001 per  share ("Company Common Stock"), set forth
opposite his or its name on _Schedule_ _A_ (all  such shares set forth on
_Schedule  A_ opposite such Shareholders  name, such Shareholders
"Schedule  A Shares").

 

Concurrently with the execution  and delivery of this Agreement, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company are entering  into the Merger Agreement, which
provides for, among other things, the making  of a tender offer by Merger Sub
for all of the outstanding shares of the  Company Common Stock and the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company,  upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein.

 

As a condition to Parents  willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Parent has required that  each Shareholder enter into this Agreement.

 

In consideration of the foregoing  and the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements set  forth herein, and intending to be legally
bound, the parties agree as follows:

 

Section 1. _Certain  Definitions_. The following capitalized  terms, as used
in this Agreement, shall have the meanings set forth below:

 

 "beneficial  ownership" of any security  by any Person means "beneficial ownership" of such security as  determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, including all  securities as to which such Person has the right to acquire, without regard  to the 60-day period set forth in such rule. The terms "beneficially owned" and "beneficial  owner" shall have correlative  meanings.

 

 "Shares" means,  with respect to any Shareholder, (i) such Shareholder\'s Schedule A Shares  and (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock of which such Shareholder acquires  beneficial ownership during the Agreement Period.

 

 "Principal  Shareholder" means Randal  J. Kirk.

 

Section 2. _Agreement  to Tender_. Each Shareholder hereby  agrees to
validly tender or cause to be tendered in the Offer all of such 
Shareholders Shares (excluding for purposes of this Section 2 any  Shares
that are the subject of unexercised Options or SARs) pursuant to  and in
accordance with the terms of the Offer as promptly as practicable  (but no
later than the close of business on the 17th business  day) after
commencement of the Offer. In furtherance of the   
  
 

foregoing, each Shareholder shall  (i) deliver to the depositary designated
in the Offer (the "Depositary")  (A) a letter of transmittal with respect to
its Shares complying with the  terms of the Offer, (B) a certificate or
certificates representing such Shares  or an "agent\'s message" (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer  as the Depositary may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer  of any uncertificated Shares
and (C) all other documents or instruments,  to the extent applicable,
required to be delivered by other shareholders  of the Company pursuant to
the terms of the Offer, and/or (ii) instruct its  broker or such other Person
that is the holder of record of any Shares to  tender such Shares pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of the Offer.  Each Shareholder agrees that
once its Shares are tendered, such Shareholder  will not withdraw or cause to
be withdrawn any of such Shares from the Offer,  unless and until this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance  with Section 13(d). Upon
the end of the Agreement Period, Parent shall cause  the Depositary to
immediately return to each Shareholder all certificates  representing such
Shareholder\'s Shares which had been previously delivered  to the Depositary
pursuant to this Section 2 or, with regard to uncertificated  Shares, to take
such other appropriate action to immediately evidence and  effect the return
of such Shares to each Shareholder in book-entry form or  otherwise.

 

Section 3. _Documentation  and Information_. Each Shareholder  (i) consents
to and authorizes the publication and disclosure by Parent  of such
Shareholders identity and holding of Shares, the nature of  such
Shareholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under  this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of  this
Agreement) and any other information, in each case, that Parent reasonably 
determines is required to be disclosed by applicable Law in any press
release,  the Offer Documents, the Company Proxy Statement (including all
schedules  and documents filed with the SEC), or any other disclosure
document in  connection with the Offer, the Merger and any transactions
contemplated  by the Merger Agreement and (ii) agrees promptly to give to
Parent any  information it may reasonably require for the preparation of any
such disclosure  documents. Each Shareholder agrees to promptly notify Parent
of any required  corrections with respect to any information supplied by such
Shareholder  specifically for use in any such disclosure document, if and to
the extent  that any such information shall have become false or misleading
in any  material respect.

 

Section 4. _Voting  Agreement_. During the period  beginning on the date of
this Agreement and ending on the earlier of (x)  the Effective Time, (y) the
agreement of the parties hereto to terminate  this Agreement, and (z) the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance  with its terms (the

unconditionally  agrees that at any meeting (whether annual or special and
whether or not  an adjourned or postponed meeting) of the holders of Company
Common Stock,  however called (each, a "Company  Shareholders Meeting"), 
or in connection with any written consent of the holders of Company Common 
Stock, each Shareholder shall:

 

 (a)  be present, in person or represented by proxy, or otherwise cause such Shareholders  Shares to be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum  at such meeting (to the fullest extent that such Shares may be counted for  quorum purposes under applicable Law);

 

 (b)  vote (or cause to be voted) or deliver a written consent (or cause a written  consent to be delivered) with respect to all such Shareholders Shares,  in each case, to the fullest extent that such Shares are entitled to be voted  at the time of any vote or action by written consent:

Shareholder, to: (a) attend any and all Company Shareholder Meetings;  (b)

dispositive power over such Shares  with Principal Shareholder. As of the
date hereof, with respect to each Shareholder,  except as set forth opposite
such Shareholders name on _Schedule A_ , such  Shareholders Schedule A
Shares are issued and outstanding and entitled  to be voted at the Company
Shareholder Meeting and such Shareholder does  not beneficially own any
warrants, options or other rights to acquire any  shares of Company Common

the Agreement Period, shall at all times be free  and clear of Liens,
proxies, powers of attorney, voting trusts, options,  rights of first offer
or refusal or agreements (other than any Liens or proxy  created by this
Agreement). Except as provided in this Agreement, there are  no agreements or
arrangements of any kind, contingent or otherwise, to which  such Shareholder
is a party obligating such Shareholder to Transfer, or cause  to be
Transferred, any of such Shareholders Shares. Except pursuant  to the Merger
Agreement, no Person has any contractual or other right or  obligation to
purchase or otherwise acquire any of such Shareholders  Shares.

 

 (e) _Absence  of Litigation_.

 (f) _Opportunity  to Review; Reliance_. Each Shareholder  has had the opportunity to review this Agreement and the Merger Agreement  with counsel of his or its own choosing. Each Shareholder understands and  acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance  upon such Shareholders execution, delivery and performance of this  Agreement.

 

 (g) _Finders  Fees_.  No investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary is entitled to  a fee or commission from Parent or the Company in respect of this Agreement  based upon any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of such Shareholder  in his capacity as such.

 

Section 7. _No  Proxies for or Encumbrances on Covered Shares_.

 

 (a)  Except pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as agreed in writing by  Parent, during the Agreement Period, no Shareholder shall (nor permit any  Person under such Shareholders control to), without the prior written  consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, (i) grant any proxies, powers  of attorney, rights of first offer or refusal or enter into any voting trust,  (ii) sell (including short sell), assign, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber,  grant a participation interest in, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of (including  by gift) (each, a "Transfer"),  (iii) otherwise permit any Liens to be created on, or (iv) enter into any  Contract (including any derivative, hedging or other agreement), option or  other arrangement (including any profits sharing arrangement) or understanding  with respect to the direct or indirect Transfer of, any Shares. No Shareholder  shall, and shall not permit any Person under such Shareholders 

 

5   
  
 

control or any of its or their  respective Representatives to, seek or
solicit any such Transfer or any such  Contract, option or other arrangement
or understanding and agrees to notify  Parent promptly, and to provide all
details requested by Parent, if Principal  Shareholder shall be approached or
solicited, directly or indirectly, by  any Person with respect to any of the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing,  no Shareholder shall, and shall
not permit any Person under such Shareholders  control or any of its or
their respective Representatives to, take any other  action that would make
any representation or warranty of such Shareholder  contained herein untrue
or incorrect in any material respect or in any way  restrict, limit or
interfere in any material respect with the performance  of such Shareholders
obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated  by the Merger
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each Shareholder  also agrees not
to engage in any transaction with respect to any of such   Shareholders
Shares with the primary purpose of depriving Parent of  the intended benefits
of this Agreement.

 

 (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Shareholder shall have the right to Transfer  its or his Shares to a Permitted Transferee of such Shareholder if and only  if such Permitted Transferee shall have agreed in writing, in a manner acceptable  in form and substance to Parent, (i) to accept such Shares subject to the  terms and conditions of this Agreement and (ii) to be bound by this Agreement  and to agree and acknowledge that such Person shall constitute a Shareholder  for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding such Transfer, Principal Shareholder  shall continue to be liable for any breach by the transferee or other recipient  of such Transferred Shares of this Agreement with respect to such Transferred  Shares. "Permitted Transferee" means,  with respect to any Shareholder, (A) any other Shareholder, (B) a spouse,  lineal descendant or antecedent, brother or sister, adopted child or grandchild  or the spouse of any child, adopted child, grandchild or adopted grandchild  of such Shareholder, (C) any charitable organization described in Section  170(c) of the Code, (D) any trust, the trustees of which include only the  Persons named in clause (A) or (B) and the beneficiaries of which include  only the Persons named in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D), (E) any corporation,  limited liability company or partnership, the shareholders, members or general  or limited partners of which include only the Persons named in clause (A)  or (B), or (F) if such Shareholder is a trust, the beneficiary or beneficiaries  authorized or entitled to receive distributions from such trust.

 

 (c)  No Shareholder shall request that the Company register the Transfer (book-entry  or otherwise) of any certificate or uncertificated interest representing  any of such Shareholders Shares, unless such Transfer is made in compliance  with this Agreement. Each Shareholder hereby authorizes Parent to direct  the Company to impose stop orders to prevent the Transfer of any Shares on  the books of the Company in violation of this Agreement.

 

Section 8. _Street  Name Shares_. With respect to  the 523,650 Schedule A
Shares beneficially owned by Randal J. Kirk (2000)  Limited Partnership which
are held of record by Charles Schwab and Co.,  Inc. (the "Broker"),  Randal J.
Kirk (2000) Limited Partnership shall, by no later than March  1, 2007,
deliver a letter to the Broker that informs the Broker of such 
Shareholder\'s obligations under this Agreement and that informs the Broker 
that the Broker may not act in disregard of such obligations without the 
prior written consent of Parent.

 

Section 9. _Waiver  of Appraisal Rights_. Each Shareholder  hereby
irrevocably waives any and all rights he or it may have as to appraisal, 
dissent or any similar or related matter with respect to any of such
Shareholders  Shares that may arise with respect to the Merger or any of the
transactions  contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, without
limitation, under  Article 15 of the VSCA.

 

6   
  
 

Section 10. _Notices  of Certain Events_. Each Shareholder  shall notify
Parent of any development occurring after the date hereof  that causes, or
that would reasonably be expected to cause, any breach  of any of the
representations and warranties of such Shareholder set forth  in Section 6.

 

Section 11 _._ _Further  Assurances_. Parent and each Shareholder  will each
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all  further
documents and instruments and use their respective reasonable best  efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause  to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable  Laws and
regulations, to perform their respective obligations under this  Agreement.

 

Section 12 _._ _Certain  Adjustments_. In the event of  a stock split, stock
dividend or distribution, or any change in the Company  Common Stock by
reason of a stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization,  combination,
reclassification, readjustment, exchange of shares or the  like, the terms
"Schedule A Shares" and "Shares" shall  be deemed to refer to and include
such shares as well as all such stock  dividends and distributions and any
securities into which or for which  any or all of such shares may be changed
or exchanged or which are received  in the transaction.

 PLAN OF MERGER

 

merging

 

 SHUTTLE CORPORATION, 
 a Virginia corporation

 

 with and into

 

 NEW RIVER PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 
 a Virginia corporation

 

  1. _Merger_. Shuttle Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the "
_Merged Corporation_ ") and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Shire plc,
a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales ("
_Parent_ "), shall, upon the effective time and date set forth in the Articles
of Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be filed with the State
Corporation Commission (the " _SCC_ ") of the Commonwealth of Virginia (such
time being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "), be merged (the "
_Merger_ ") with and into New River Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Virginia
corporation (the " _Company_ "). As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Merged Corporation shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The corporate existence of the Company, with all
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger.

 

  2. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 13.1 -721 of the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (the " _VSCA_ "). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and the Merged
Corporation shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company
and the Merged Corporation shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  3. _Articles of Incorporation_. __ At the Effective Time, the Articles
of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated as set forth on
_Schedule A_ attached hereto, so that they shall be identical to the articles
of incorporation of the Merged Corporation in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall
be "New River Pharmaceuticals Inc."), and shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until the same shall thereafter
be altered, amended or repealed in accordance with the VSCA or the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  4. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company shall be
amended and restated so that they shall be identical to the bylaws of the
Merged Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that the name of the Surviving Corporation reflected therein shall be
"New River Pharmaceuticals Inc."), and shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or repealed
in

 

 B-1    
  
  

 accordance with the VSCA, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  5. _Board of Directors_. The directors of the Merged Corporation
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

  6. _Officers_. The officers of Merged Corporation immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

  7. _Manner and Basis of Converting Shares of Company Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Merged Corporation, the Company or the holders of any shares of
Company Common Stock or of any shares of common stock, no par value per share,
of the Merged Corporation:

 

  (a) _Capital Stock of the Merged Corporation_. Each share of
common stock of the Merged Corporation issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per
share, of the Surviving Corporation, and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  (b) _Cancellation of Subsidiary-Owned and Parent-Owned Company
Common_ _Stock_. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, the Merged Corporation or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

  (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 7(b)_ or shares
for which the holders thereof properly demanded appraisal as provided in 
_Section 9_ )shall be converted into the right to receive $64.00 in cash or
any higher price paid for each share of Company Common Stock in the Offer,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate (or, in the case of uncertificated shares, evidence of shares in
book-entry form) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with _Section_ _10(b)_ , without interest.

 

 B-2    
  
  

  8. _Company Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights_.

 

  (a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all options to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time granted by the Company under any Company Stock Plan (each, an "
_Option_ "), whether or not fully vested and exercisable, shall be cancelled
and each holder of an Option shall be paid in full satisfaction of such
Option, a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of
Company Common Stock then subject to the Option, subject to applicable
withholding Taxes. Promptly (and in no event more than three business days)
after the Effective Time, Parent shall make or cause the Surviving Corporation
to make the cash payments to be made to holders of Options pursuant to this
_Section 8(a)_.

 

  (b) _Company Stock Appreciation Rights_. At the Effective Time,
all stock appreciation rights outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time with respect to shares of Company Common Stock, whether or not granted
under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _SAR_ "), and whether or not
fully vested and exercisable, shall be cancelled and each holder of a SAR
shall be paid in full satisfaction of such SAR, a cash amount equal to the SAR
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the SAR,
subject to applicable withholding Taxes. Promptly (and in no event more than
three business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall make or cause the
Surviving Corporation to make the cash payments to be made to holders of SARs
pursuant to this _Section 8(b)_.

 

  (c) _Consent_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan of
Merger to the contrary, payment pursuant to this  _Section 8(c)_ may be
withheld in respect of any Option or SAR until any consent determined by the
Company to be required has been obtained.

 

  9. _Dissenters  Shares_. Shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
shareholders who shall not have voted or caused or permitted any of their
shares to be voted in favor of the Merger shall have properly demanded
appraisal for such shares in accordance with the VSCA to the extent entitled
thereto (collectively, the " _Dissenters  Shares_") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and such
shareholders instead shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the
VSCA; _provided_ that all Dissenters Shares held by shareholders who shall
have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise
lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under the VSCA shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of
the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon,
the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates in the manner
provided in _Section 10_ hereof that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, evidenced such shares.

 

  10. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

  (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a national bank or trust company (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 7(c)_. Parent shall deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with
the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited

 

 B-3    
  
  

 with the Paying Agent may, pending its disbursement to such holders, be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) direct obligations
of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination
of the foregoing. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Any portion
of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
this _Section 10(a)_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which
appraisal rights have been properly demanded shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

 

  (b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event more than five business days thereafter),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary
provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly pay
to such holder, in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate and such Certificate so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled.
The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, in accordance with this
_Section 10(b)_ , each Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates.

 

  (c) _Transfer Books_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Section 10(c)_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates,
and from and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the

 

 B-4    
  
  

 Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last
sentence of _Section 10(e)_  if, at any time after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for in this _Section
10(c)_ , subject to compliance with the procedures set forth herein.

 

  (d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
_Section 10(d)_.

 

  (e) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 10(a)_ and any
interest received with respect thereto that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for nine months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and thereafter any holders of
Company Common Stock who have not complied with this _Section 10(e)_ prior to
the end of such nine-month period shall be entitled to look only to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates
held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time
at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

  (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan of
Merger to the contrary, none of the Company, the Merged Corporation, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, any of their respective Affiliates or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

  (g) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (without
duplication) from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law, and Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall provide to the former holders of Company Common Stock
written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld. To the extent amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

 B-5    
  
  

  11. _Amendment and Termination_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Plan of Merger may be amended, whether before or after receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, by written agreement of the Company, the
Merged Corporation and Parent, by action taken by their respective Boards of
Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that following approval of the Merger by
the Company Shareholders and Parent, there shall be no amendment or change to
the provisions hereof which by applicable Law would require further approval
by the Company Shareholders or Parent, respectively, including to effect any
of the changes listed in §13.1 -716E of the VSCA.
