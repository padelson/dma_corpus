equal to the quotient of (a) the Montreal Guaranty Amount, as adjusted to
give effect to the CAD/USD exchange rate quoted in the Wall Street Journal on

acquisition or formation and continues to be treated for United
States federal and state income tax purposes as (A) a partnership (or a
disregarded entity) and not as a corporation or an association or publicly
traded partnership taxable as a corporation, (B) a Qualified REIT Subsidiary,
or (C) a Taxable REIT Subsidiary.

the Company nor any of the Company's Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" as such terms are
defined in Section 355 of the Code in a distribution of stock outside of the

respect to any assets or properties of the Company or any of the

may directly or indirectly through its Agents, subject to _Section 4.02(d)_ ,

counsel and the Company's financial advisor, constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, and (ii) thereafter
furnish non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to such third-party with which it has entered into a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent within

confidentiality and standstill arrangements that are no less favorable to the
Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement shall contain provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement,
including _Section 4.02_ hereunder) (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") and afford access to the properties, books, records, or
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public
information that is provided to any such Person which has not previously been
provided to Parent and Merger Sub. For the avoidance of doubt, the Board

 unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action.

  



    

-40-

 



    



  

(d) The Company will notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than twenty-four hours) after receipt by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or
any of its or their respective Agents, of any Takeover Proposal, any inquiry
that the Company reasonably believes could be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party.
In such notice, the Company shall identify the third party making, and
details of the material terms and conditions of, any such Takeover Proposal,
indication or request. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
current and prompt basis, of the status of any such Takeover Proposal,
inquiry or request (including the material terms and conditions thereof and
any modifications thereto), and the Company shall promptly provide Parent
with any non-public information concerning the Company\'s business, present or

net income on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect
acquisition of five percent (5%) or more (or, in the case of any person
beneficially owning (for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) five
percent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares) of Common Stock as of the date
of this Agreement, any additional shares of any class of outstanding voting
or equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning five percent (5%) or more (or, in the case of any person
beneficially owning (for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) five
percent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date
of this Agreement, any additional shares) of any class of outstanding voting
or equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D)

dissolution), recapitalization, extraordinary dividend (whether in cash or
other property) or other significant corporate reorganization of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (E) merger, consolidation or other combination
involving the Company and any third-party other than a Subsidiary, or (F) any
combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the

Stock involved is five percent (5%) or more; in each case, other than the
Transactions contemplated hereunder; and

  



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written, bona-fide Takeover
Proposal, which, in the good faith determination of the Board, taking
into consideration the various legal, financial, and regulatory aspects of
such Takeover Proposal (provided that, for purposes of this definition of "
_Superior Proposal_ " only, references to five percent (5%) in the definition
of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to thirty-five percent
(35%)) and the Person or "group", within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, making such Takeover Proposal (including any required financing,
stockholder approval requirements of the Person or group making the proposal,
regulatory approvals, stockholder litigation, breakup fee and expense
reimbursement provisions, expected timing and risk and likelihood of
consummation, and, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Board, such other
factors that may be considered in making such a determination under the MGCL,
including any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
during the Notice Period) if consummated, would result in a transaction that

Company than the Transactions contemplated hereby.

  



    

-41-

 



    



  

(f) Except as permitted by _Section 4.02(g)_ , neither the Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i)(A) fail to make, amend, change,

or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Agents to enter
into any Acquisition Agreement, or (v) resolve to do any of the foregoing.

Approval is obtained, but not after, the Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or cause the Company to (or permit any
Company Subsidiary to) enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Takeover Proposal only if the Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (i) that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to cause the Board
to be in breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to taking such action (A) the Company has given
Parent at least five (5) Business Days' (the " _Notice Period_ ") prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
include a copy of the Superior Proposal, a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating
thereto), (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall negotiate, and shall
cause their respective Agents to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during
such Notice Period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, in order to
enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement and any
other agreements relating to the Transactions contemplated hereunder such
that the Takeover Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (C)
following the end of such Notice Period, the Board shall have considered in
good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement and any other
agreements relating to the Transactions contemplated hereby proposed in
writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the Takeover Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given
effect, and (D) in the event that, after the commencement of the Notice
Period, there is any material change to the terms of such Takeover Proposal,
the Company shall deliver to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (A) above, and the Notice Period shall be extended,
if applicable, in order to ensure that at least three (3) Business Days
remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time that the Company notifies
Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be
multiple extensions); and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company has
complied in with its obligations under this _Section 4.02_.

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.02_ shall prohibit the
Company, after the receipt of advice from outside legal counsel that
failure to disclose such position would constitute a violation of applicable
Law, from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that any
disclosures permitted under this _Section 4.02(h)_ that does not contain
either an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation shall be deemed a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to
the stockholders of the Company) in which the Company indicates that it has
not changed the Company Recommendation.

02, in the event that Parent has not funded the Escrow Account, or caused
the Escrow Account to be funded, with an amount in cash equal to the Reverse
Termination Fee within twenty-one (21) days following the date of this
Agreement, then the provisions of this _Section 4.02_ shall be of no force or
effect until such time, if any, as Parent funds the Escrow Account, or causes
the Escrow Account to be funded, with an amount in cash equal to the
Reverse Termination Fee, at which time (unless this Agreement shall have
previously been terminated), and with no further action by any Party hereto,
the provisions of this _Section 4.02_ shall be restored and in full force and
effect and binding on the Parties hereto.

respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC and its staff
with respect thereto or the Transactions (whether written or oral) and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, to commence mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable
(but in no event prior to the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC)
after responding to all such comments to the satisfaction of the SEC and its
staff. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and its legal counsel upon
the receipt of any such comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement,
and shall provide Parent and its legal counsel with copies of all

SEC and its staff, on the other hand. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy

(i) shall provide Parent and its legal counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and (ii) provide Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to advise in connection with any

-43-

 



    



  

(b) Parent and the Company shall each cooperate in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall promptly furnish to the Company in
writing the information relating to them required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not on the date it is
first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders' Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to
receipt of the Stockholder Approval, any event occurs with respect to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub, or any change occurs
with respect to other information to be included in the Proxy Statement, which
is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly notify
the other party of such event and the Company shall promptly file, following
compliance with _Section 5.01(a)_ , any necessary amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, and thereafter promptly prepare and disseminate amended
or supplemented proxy materials (and, if required in connection therewith,
re-solicit proxies).

  



  

(c) (i) Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.01_ , the Company shall, as soon as practicable, but in no event
later than 45 days after the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC and
its staff for mailing to the stockholders of the Company, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Stockholders '
Meeting_") for the purpose of obtaining Stockholder Approval to adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger, in each case, duly called and held for such
purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may
postpone or adjourn the Stockholders' Meeting only (i) with the consent of
Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, or (iii) to such date following the
filing of the Company's report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September
30, 2015 (the " _2015 Q3 10-Q_ ") as is reasonably selected by the Company in
accordance with _Section 5.01(c)(ii)_ below. " _Stockholder Approval_ " is
obtained at the Stockholders' Meeting if a majority of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon vote in favor of adopting the
Agreement and approving the Merger.

  



  

(ii) The Company shall not hold the Stockholders Meeting at any time prior to
the third (3rd) Business Day following the date that the 2015 Q3 10-Q is filed
with the SEC.

  



  

(d) Unless the Board shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section 4.02(g)_ , the Board
shall make the Company Recommendation, include such Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Stockholder Approval. The notice of such Stockholders' Meeting shall state
that a resolution to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger will be
considered at the Stockholder Meeting.

Section 5.04 _Indemnification; Advancement of Expenses; Exculpation
and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at
the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each,
an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or
in part, (1) the fact that an Indemnitee was a director or officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or (2) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or taken at the request of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or fiduciary of another Person
(including any Company Benefit Plan), in each case under (1) or (2), at, or
at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the Transactions),
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in
respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in (1) the
Articles and Bylaws and the organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries, in each instance, as applicable and as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, and (2) any indemnification agreement between any such
Indemnitee and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as currently in
effect, which agreements shall survive the Merger and the other Transactions
and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. In
addition, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall
pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any
Indemnitee under this _Section 5.04_ (including in connection with enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this _Section 5.04_ ) as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided that
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances to the extent required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, all rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability
of, each Indemnified Party provided for in this  _Section 5.04_ or in the
Articles or Bylaws or the respective other organizational documents of the
applicable Company Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof
(including through any indemnification agreement) shall not be modified, and
shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _ however_ , that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on personal
liability in respect of any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, subject to the provisions of this
_Section 5.04_ , maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
(and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered
by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms
and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to
such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or
Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at
least the same coverage required above with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not
be obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent
such premiums exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid
as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (such three hundred
(300%) amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); and _provided further_ that, if the
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance shall exceed the Base Premium,
then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable
individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual
premium equal to the Base Premium. Prior to the Effective Time Parent or the
Company may purchase, for an aggregate amount that shall not exceed the Base
Premium, a 6-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing at
least materially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid
"tail policy" has been obtained by Parent or the Company, it shall be deemed
to satisfy all obligations of the Parent to obtain insurance pursuant to this
_Section 5.04_. The Surviving Entity shall not amend, modify, cancel or
revoke such policy and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.04_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives, and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Entity under this _Section 5.04_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.04_ applies unless (A) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law, or (B) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.04_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.04_ ).

  



  

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 5.04_.

  



  

Section 5.05 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise specified in
_Section 7.02_ , _Section 7.03_ , or agreed in writing by the parties, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  



  

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without
the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(a) a party may, without the prior written consent of the other party, issue
such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange if the party issuing such press
release or making such public statement has used its reasonable best efforts
to consult with the other party and to obtain such party's consent but has
been unable to do so in a timely manner, and (b) the Company may, without
the prior written consent of Parent, and in compliance with any applicable
notification provisions in _Section 4.02_ , issue such press release or make
such public statement release or announcement with respect to a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change effected in accordance with _Section 4.02(g)_.
The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to
the Transactions shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

  



  

Section 5.07 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other Transactions, (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such party's knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or, in the case of
the Company, a Company Subsidiary, and, in the case of Parent and Merger Sub,
any of their respective Subsidiaries, which relate to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions, and (c) any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty or breach of covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that could reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ or _Section
6.02_ not to be satisfied.

Section 5.08 [ _Reserved_.]

  



  

Section 5.09 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover applicable
Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Merger or any of the other Transactions, then each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover applicable Law inapplicable to
the foregoing.

taken, all actions necessary to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the proceeds
of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letters until the funding of the Financing at or prior to Closing,
(ii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Agreements_ ") consistent in all material respects with the terms
and conditions contained in each Debt Commitment Letter (including any
related "flex" provisions) or on other terms not less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub (as determined by Parent in good faith) than the terms and
conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments and (iii) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) all
conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the
Financing that are within their control, and Parent and/or Merger Sub shall,

-49-

 



    



  

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), (i) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver
of, any material provision or remedy under, or replace, any of the Commitment
Letters if such amendment, modification, waiver, or replacement (A) would add
any new (or modify any existing) condition to the Financing Commitments
(unless such new condition or modified condition would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Financing), (B)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing intended to be funded on the
Closing Date unless the Equity Financing or Debt Financing is increased by a
corresponding amount (or Merger Sub may draw upon an available revolver to
fund an amount equal to such reduction), (C) adversely affects the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters
or the Definitive Agreements, if any, to require such parties to provide the
Debt Financing or Equity Financing, as applicable, or (D) would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Financing _or_ (ii) terminate any Commitment Letter unless such Commitment
Letter is replaced with another commitment letter that would not result in
any of the items described in clause (i)(A) through (D) of this sentence
(collectively, the " _Restricted Financing Commitment Amendments_ ")
(provided that the existence or exercise of "flex" provisions which do not
permit a reduction in the aggregate amount of the Financing shall not
constitute a Restricted Financing Commitment Amendment; and provided,
further, that Parent and/or Merger Sub may amend or modify, or waive any
provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments if such amendment,
modification or waiver is not a Restricted Financing Commitment Amendment, it
being understood that any amendment or modification solely to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities
(and make incidental or conforming amendments or modifications to reflect the
addition of any such lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
and similar entities) shall not be a Restricted Financing Commitment
Amendment). Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification or replacement
of the Debt Financing Commitments or the Equity Financing Commitments in
accordance with this _Section 5.11(b)_ , the terms " _Debt Financing
Commitments_ " and " _Equity Financing Commitments_ " shall mean, other than

_Section 3.02(d)_ , the Debt Financing Commitments and the Equity Financing
Commitments, respectively, as so amended, supplemented, modified or replaced.

  



  

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, to the extent such portion is
necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
alternative financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
other sources of funds available to Parent, to replace such unavailable
portion) from the same or other sources and on terms which would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Financing, the Merger or the other Transactions. For
the purposes of this Agreement, other than for purposes of representations
and warranties made as of the date hereof in _Section 3.02(d)_ , the terms
"Debt Commitment Letter" and "Debt Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment with
respect to any alternative debt financing arranged in compliance herewith (and
any Debt Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Commitment remaining in effect
at the time in question) and all references to the Lenders shall include the
persons providing or arranging such alternative debt financing. For the
purposes of this Agreement, other than for purposes of representations and
warranties made as of the date hereof in _Section 3.02(d)_ , the terms "
_Equity Commitment Letters_ " and " _Equity Financing Commitments_ " shall be
deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment
with respect to any alternative equity financing arranged in compliance
herewith (and any Equity Commitment Letters and Equity Financing
Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question).

(d) Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of

communication from any Lender or Equity Investor with respect to (1) any
actual or potential material breach or material default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letters or the Definitive

disagreement between or among any parties to any of the Commitment Letters or
the Definitive Agreements, if any, with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing, in the case
of clauses (1) and (2) that would reasonably be expected to result in Merger
Sub not receiving the proceeds of the Financing on the Closing Date. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Parent
with this _Section 5.11(d)_ shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its
respective obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the time specified in Section 1.02 whether or not the
Financing is available, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_.

  



  

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.11_ or any other provisions of this
Agreement shall require, and in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts"
of Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require, Parent or Merger
Sub to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any source other than the Equity
Investors or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letters, (ii) seek or accept Debt Financing on terms less
favorable than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including the
"flex" provisions) provided on the date of this Agreement, (iii) waive any
term or condition of this Agreement or (iv) pay any fees in excess of those
contemplated by the Financing Commitments (whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise).

presentations, rating agency sessions and sessions with prospective financing
sources (including the Lenders and/or investors in the Debt Financing), and
due diligence sessions, including direct contact between senior management

sources (including the Lenders) in the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations and bank books, lender and investor presentations, bank

Company Subsidiaries reasonably requested by the financing sources (including
the Lenders) and reasonably available to the Company, (v) facilitating the
granting of security interests (and perfection thereof) in collateral, or the
execution and delivery of guarantees, mortgages, other definitive financing
documents or other certificates or documents to the extent constituting a
condition to any Lender's obligation to fund any portion of the Debt
Financing by the applicable Debt Commitment Letter (or otherwise required by
such applicable Debt Commitment Letter), including obtaining releases of
existing Liens; provided, that any grants of security interests or obligations
and releases of Liens contained in all such agreements and documents shall be
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time; _provided_ , that (i) in no
event shall the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries be required to
enter into any agreement unless such agreement is contingent upon the Closing
and (ii) (A) neither the Company nor any Persons who are directors of the
Company shall be required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or
authorize the execution of the Debt Financing and (B) no obligation of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Agents under any certificate, document or instrument executed pursuant to the
foregoing shall be effective until the Closing and (C) none of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries nor any of its or their respective Agents shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other out-of-
pocket cost or expense that is not reimbursed by Parent or Merger Sub.
Nothing contained in this _Section 5.11(f)_ or otherwise shall require the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to be an issuer or other obligor
with respect to the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their
respective Agents in connection with such cooperation and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Agents for, from and against any and all Losses actually suffered or incurred
by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action
taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.11(f)_ and

action or inaction taken or omitted to be taken in reliance thereon by Parent
absent willful misconduct by Parent. The Stockholders' Representative shall

Section 5.15 _Indebtedness_. (a) Prior to the Closing, the
parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts (including paying or providing Additional Concessions, if any, up to
the aggregate amount specified on _Section 5.15_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) to obtain all of the consents, approvals and waivers, as
applicable, relating to the Indebtedness of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 5.15_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Assumed Indebtedness_ "), as are required to permit the consummation
of the Merger and such Assumed Indebtedness to be assumed by Parent or its
designated Affiliate (including the change in control of the applicable
Company Subsidiary) at the Effective Time on substantially the same terms and
conditions as currently in effect (such consents, approvals and waivers,
collectively, the " _Required Indebtedness Consents_ "), other than any
requirement that any of the Company, Parent or its designated Affiliate is
required to (i) pay consent fees, transfer fees or other similar fees and
expenses, in each case, to the extent required by the express terms of the
underlying loan documents, (ii) agree to conforming amendments or
modifications necessary solely to substitute loan parties, carve out
guarantors or otherwise to document the assignment or assumption, or (iii)
substitute Parent or its designated Affiliate in the place of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary with respect to any guarantees, letters of credit, reserve
requirements or other similar arrangements existing as of the date hereof (or
as modified after the date hereof in compliance with _Section 4.01(x)_ , which
modifications shall not increase materially any liability of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company thereunder without the consent of Parent)
(clauses (i) through (iii), the " _Excepted Concessions_ "). For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Excepted Concessions_ " shall not include any (x) fees or
expenses payable by any of the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates
(including, but not be limited to, any penalty, make-whole premium,
defeasance, principal pay-down or other payment) to the lenders in respect of
such Assumed Indebtedness, in each instance, other than those fees and
expenses expressly set forth in clause (i) of "Excepted Concessions," or (y)
instance in which the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates is
required to provide additional credit support or collateral, in each case,
other than as set forth in clause (iii) of "Excepted Concessions"
(any amounts paid or provided in accordance with clauses (x) or (y), the "
_Additional Concessions_ "). Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement, without the prior consent of Parent, in no instance shall the
Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates, pay or provide Additional
Concessions in excess of the amount specified on _Section 5.15_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule in connection with obtaining the Required Indebtedness
Consents necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in _Section 6.02(g)_.
Prior to the Closing, the Company and Parent further agree to cooperate and
use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such other consents,
approvals and waivers, as applicable, relating to the Assumed Indebtedness as
Parent may reasonably request.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to cooperate with
Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to implement such arrangements as

in connection with the Closing, including, without limitation, executing and
delivering such documents, instruments and other arrangements as may be
reasonably required in connection therewith.

stockholder or derivative suit, action, litigation or claim against the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates, or any of
their respective directors or officers, in each instance, relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. Each of Parent and

shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best
efforts to take any and all actions necessary or required in order to

benefit of holders of Common Stock), immediately prior to, but conditioned
upon, the Effective Time, the properties (or the equity interests of the
Company Subsidiaries owning the properties) set forth on _Section 5.17_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Pre-Closing Disposition_ "). None of
the representations, warranties or covenants of the Company shall be deemed
to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any of the actions
contemplated by this _Section 5.17_ or by any action taken by the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Agents at the request of
Parent in furtherance of this _Section 5.17_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) in no event shall the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries be
required to enter into any agreement under or with respect to this _Section
5.17_ unless such agreement is contingent upon the Closing, and (ii) no
obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Agents under any certificate, document or instrument executed

their respective Agents for, from and against any and all Losses actually
suffered or incurred by them in connection with such cooperation, any action
taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.17_ and
any information utilized in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this  _Section 5.17_ , Parent and Merger Sub shall not seek
to implement a Potential Disposition that would reasonably be expected to
cause a breach, violation or default under, or give rise to a termination
right with respect to, the Debt Commitment Letters or that would reasonably
be expected to materially delay the Closing or have a material adverse effect
on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.

or exercise its rights under any of the conditions to the closing of such
transactions set forth in the Copper Beach Agreement solely to the extent
required by _Section 5.18_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and (B) use

to the Copper Beech Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), consent to any amendment or modification
to, or any waiver of, any material provision or remedy under, the
Copper Beech Agreement if such amendment, modification, or waiver (1) would
add any new (or modify any existing) material condition to the closing of
such transactions (unless such new condition or modified condition would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, or materially impede or delay such
closing), (2) adversely affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Copper Beech Agreements to require such parties
to consummate such transactions, or (3) would reasonably be expected
to prevent, or materially impede or delay the closing of such transactions.
Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of (i) any
material breach or default by any party to the Copper Beech Agreement which
Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware of, (ii) any termination of the Copper
Beech Agreement, (iii) the receipt of any written notice from any party to the
Copper Beech Agreement with respect to (A) any material breach or material
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Copper Beech
Agreement, if any, of any provision thereof, or (B) any material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Copper Beech Agreement, if
any. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its
efforts to consummate the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Copper Beech Agreement.

any other Person (other than any Person party to the Copper Beech Agreement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in no event shall the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries be required to enter into any agreement under or with
respect to this _Section 5.18(b)_ unless such agreement is contingent upon
the Closing, and (ii) no obligation of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Agents under any certificate,
document or instrument executed pursuant to the foregoing shall be
effective until the Closing. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Agents for, from

Agreement, and (y) the Company _does not_ have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(iii)_.

 RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, HSRE Quad Merger Sub, LLC, a Maryland limited liability
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), the Company
and CCGSR, Inc., a Delaware corporation, have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which the Company, at the Closing, will be merged with and into
Merger Sub with Merger Sub as the surviving entity;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates the execution and delivery of this
Escrow Agreement and the deposit by Parent with the Escrow Agent of certain
funds to secure certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger
Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent agrees to hold and distribute such funds in
accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is not a party to, is
not bound by, and has no duties or obligations under, the Merger Agreement,
that all references in this Escrow Agreement to the Merger Agreement are for
convenience, and that the Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties beyond
the express duties set forth in this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the respective covenants, agreements and
representations and warranties set forth herein and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE 1 
 ESCROW DEPOSIT

  



  

Section 1.1. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this
Escrow Agreement, capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have
the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Escrow Agent will not be
responsible to determine or to make any inquiry into any term, capitalized, or
otherwise, not defined herein.

  



    

-83-

 



    



  

Section 1.2. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent is
hereby constituted and appointed as the escrow agent under this Escrow
Agreement and the Escrow Agent accepts the appointment in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in this Escrow Agreement and agrees to assume
and perform the duties of the escrow agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent hereby agrees and covenants that it will perform all of its
obligations under this Escrow Agreement and will not deliver custody or
possession of any of the Escrow Fund (as hereinafter defined) to anyone
except pursuant to the express terms of this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.3. _Receipt of Escrow Amount_. Simultaneously with the
execution hereof, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Parent shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent an aggregate amount in cash equal to Ten Million
US Dollars ($10,000,000) (the "Escrow Amount," and together with any interest
from time to time earned thereon, and reduced by any subsequent disbursements,
amounts withdrawn or losses on investments, the "Escrow Fund") in immediately
available funds. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Fund as security for
the obligation of Parent and the Merger Sub to pay the Reverse Termination Fee
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement under the circumstances
described herein. For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, "Reverse
Termination Fee" means an amount equal to $10,000,000.

  



  

Section 1.4. _Investments_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to deposit,
transfer, hold and invest the Escrow Fund as set forth in _Exhibit A_
 hereto, or as set forth in any subsequent joint written instruction signed
by the Company and Parent.

  



  

(b) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized and directed to sell or
redeem any such investments as it deems necessary to make any payments or
distributions required under this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
have no responsibility or liability for any loss which may result from any
investment or sale of investment made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment
permitted by this Escrow Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or any such
affiliate is acting as agent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or
dealing as principal for its own account. The parties acknowledge that the
Escrow Agent is not providing investment supervision, recommendations, or
advice.

  



  

Section 1.5. _Administration of Escrow Fund_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Fund shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent within
two (2) Business Days following Escrow Agent's receipt of (i) joint written
instructions signed by Parent and the Company authorizing the disbursement of
all or a portion of the Escrow Fund to Parent and/or Company, or (ii) a copy
of a Final Determination (as hereinafter defined) establishing the Company's
or Parent's right to receive all or a portion of the Escrow Fund, subject to
compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section 1.6_. The term "Final
Determination" means a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction having the authority to determine the amount of, and
liability with respect to, the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee to
Parent and/or Company under the Merger Agreement and the denial of, or
expiration of all rights to, appeal related thereto. Any Final Determination
shall be accompanied by a written instrument of the presenting party
certifying that such Final Determination is final, non-appealable and from a
court of competent jurisdiction, upon which instrument the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to conclusively rely without further investigation. "Business
Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, a federal or state
holiday, and any other day on which the Escrow Agent is closed.

  



    

-84-

 



    



  

(b) If the Merger is consummated then, at the Closing, the Company
and Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to disburse
any remaining Escrow Fund to Parent. Escrow Agent shall disburse such amount
to Parent within two (2) Business Days following Escrow Agent's receipt of
such joint written instruction.

  



  

(c) If Merger Agreement is terminated under circumstances that
require the payment by Parent to the Company of the Reverse Termination Fee
pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, then the Company and
Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to disburse the
Reverse Termination Fee to the Company and the remaining balance of the Escrow
Fund, if any, to the Parent. Escrow Agent shall disburse such amounts to
Company and/or Parent within two (2) Business Days following its receipt of
such joint written instruction.

  



  

(d) If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any other reason, then
the Company and Parent shall jointly in writing instruct the Escrow Agent
to disburse to Parent the remaining balance of the Escrow Fund. Escrow Agent
shall disburse such amount to Parent within two (2) Business Days following
Escrow Agent's receipt of such joint written instruction.

  



  

Section 1.6. _Security Procedure For Funds Transfers_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent shall confirm each funds transfer instruction
received in the name of a party by means of the security procedure
selected by such party and communicated to the Escrow Agent through a signed
certificate in the form of _Exhibit B-1_ , with respect to Parent, and
_Exhibit B-2_ , with respect to the Company, in each instance, which upon
receipt by the Escrow Agent shall become a part of this Escrow Agreement. The
person(s) identified by Parent and the Company in Part I on _Exhibit B-1_
and  _Exhibit B-2_ , as applicable, shall be an "Authorized Representative"
of such party. Once delivered to the Escrow Agent, _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit
B-2_ may be revised or rescinded only by a writing signed by an
Authorized Representative of the applicable party. Such revisions or
rescissions shall be effective only after actual receipt and following such
period of time as may be necessary to afford the Escrow Agent a reasonable
opportunity to act on it. If a revised Exhibit B-1 or B-2 or a rescission of
an existing Exhibit B-1 or B-2 is delivered to the Escrow Agent by an entity
that is a successor-in-interest to such party, such document shall be
accompanied by additional documentation satisfactory to the Escrow Agent
showing that such entity has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of
the party under this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) The parties understand that the Escrow Agent's inability to
receive or confirm funds transfer instructions pursuant to the
security procedure selected by such party may result in a delay in
accomplishing such funds transfer, and agree that the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable for any loss caused by any such delay.

Section 1.7. _Income Tax Allocation and Reporting and Earnings
Distribution_.

  



  

(a) The Parent and Company agree that, for all tax reporting
purposes, all interest from investment of the Escrow Fund in any
calendar year shall be allocated to and reported to the extent required by
the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") as having been earned by Parent, whether
or not such income was disbursed during such calendar year. Within forty-five
(45) calendar days after the end of each calendar year, Parent may deliver to
Escrow Agent a written direction to distribute from the Escrow Fund an amount
equal to forty percent (40%) of the interest received or accrued with respect
to the Escrow Fund during such calendar year.

  



  

(b) Prior to the date hereof, the parties shall provide the Escrow
Agent with certified tax identification numbers by furnishing
appropriate forms W-9 or W-8 and such other forms and documents that the
Escrow Agent may request. The parties understand that if such tax reporting
documentation is not provided and certified to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Agent may be required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold a portion of any interest
earned on the investment of the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent annually shall
report information on appropriate IRS Form 1099 with respect to such
interest consistent with the provisions of _Section 1.7(a)_. Parent and the
Company shall cause to be provided to the Escrow Agent all forms and
information necessary to complete such information reports. The Escrow Agent
shall have no duty to prepare or file any other federal or state tax report
or return with respect to the Escrow Fund.

  



  

(c) To the extent that the Escrow Agent becomes liable for the
payment of any taxes in respect of income derived from the investment of all
or any portion of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall satisfy such
liability to the extent possible from the Escrow Fund. Parent and the Company
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold the Escrow Agent
harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or other
cost or expense that may be assessed against the Escrow Agent on or with
respect to the Escrow Fund and the investment thereof unless such tax, late
payment, interest, penalty or other expense was directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The indemnification
provided by this _Section 1.7(c)_ is in addition to the indemnification
provided in _Section 3.1_ and shall survive the resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent and the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

  



  

Section 1.8. _Termination_. This Escrow Agreement shall terminate on the
earlier of (i) [October ____, 2025]1, and (ii) upon disbursement of the
Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 1.5_ , Section 1.7.(a) or Section 3.5. and
following such termination, this Escrow Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect except that the provisions of Sections 1.7(c), 3.1 and 3.2
hereof shall survive termination and no further fees or expenses shall be
invoiced by the Escrow Agent pursuant hereto except for unbilled fees or
expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent prior to such time.

reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses or other professional fees and
expenses which the Escrow Agent actually incurs by reason of any action,
claim or proceeding brought against the Escrow Agent, resulting from or
relating in any way to this Escrow Agreement or any transaction to which this
Escrow Agreement relates, unless such loss, liability, cost, damage or
expense shall have been finally adjudicated by a court of competent
jurisdiction or arbitrator chosen by the parties and the Escrow Agent to have
been directly caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
Escrow Agent. The parties agree solely among themselves, and without
limitation of the Escrow Agent's rights under this _Section 3.1_ and

parties to be responsible for causing the loss, damage, liability, cost or
expense against which the Escrow Agent is entitled to indemnification or, if
no such determination is made, then one-half by Parent, and one-half by the
Company. Solely as between the parties, neither this _Section 3.1_ , nor
_Section 1.7(c)_ , nor any other provision of this Escrow Agreement shall

Agreement.

thereafter shall be to safely keep the Escrow Fund and to deliver the same
to a successor escrow agent as shall be appointed by the parties, as
evidenced by a joint written notice of the parties filed with the Escrow
