have power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said Section. Such indemnification shall be mandatory and not discretionary. The indemnification
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of
such a person. Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely affect any right to indemnification of any persons existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any matter occurring prior to such repeal or
modification. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">The Corporation shall to the
fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware advance all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) incurred by any director or officer within 15 days of the presentation
of same to the Corporation, with respect to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, so long as the Corporation receives from the director or officer an unsecured undertaking to repay
such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such obligation to advance costs and expenses shall be
mandatory, and not discretionary, and shall include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in asserting affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross claims. Such undertaking to repay may, if first requested in writing by the applicable
director or officer, be on behalf of (rather than by) such director or officer, provided that in such case the Corporation shall have the right to approve the party making such undertaking. </FONT></P><P
