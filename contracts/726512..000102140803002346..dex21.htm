(iii) AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of February 10, 2003,
among JOHNSON and JOHNSON, a New Jersey corporation ("Parent"), SATURN MERGER
SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
("Sub"), and SCIOS INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").



WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has approved and
declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has approved, this
Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby
(a) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.001 per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other than the Appraisal
Shares and shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or the
Company, will be converted into the right to receive $45.00 in cash and
(b) each issued and outstanding share of Series B preferred stock, par value
$.001 per share, of the Company ("Company Preferred Stock"), other than the
Appraisal Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock directly owned by
Parent, Sub or the Company, will be converted into the right to receive
$4,500.00 in cash; and



WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



 _The Merger_



SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State

 of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at
the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to
and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the DGCL.



SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
no later than the second business day after satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of
those conditions), at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, Worldwide Plaza,
825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall not have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived on such second
business day, then the Closing shall take place on the first business day on
which all such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".



SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") executed and acknowledged by the parties in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").



SECTION 1.04.  _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.



 

2 SECTION 1.05.  _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate") shall
be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as so
amended, such Company Certificate shall be the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable law.



(b) The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.



SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.



ARTICLE II



 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

_Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_



SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or any shares of capital stock
of Parent or Sub:



(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that is directly owned by
the Company, Parent or Sub immediately prior to the



 

3 Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock._ Each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(b) and the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
$45.00 in cash, without interest (the "Common Stock Merger Consideration").
Each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.01(b) and the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive $4,500.00 in cash, without interest, which is equivalent to the
Common Stock Merger Consideration on an as converted basis (the "Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration" and, together with the Common Stock
Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Common Stock Merger
Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, respectively. The
right of any holder of a Certificate to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any
withholding that is required under applicable tax law.





(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands
appraisal of such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c), but



 

4 instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the
Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262, or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided
by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent
of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.



SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint JPMorgan Chase or another comparable bank
or trust company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment
of the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Certificates, cash in an amount sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section
2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 



(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as practicable (but not later than five
(5) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of



 

5 letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be
made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right
to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.



(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. At the
close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock



 

6 transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented
to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against
delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.



(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration.



(e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent.



(g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect thereto.





 

7 (h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent.



ARTICLE III



 _Representations and Warranties_



SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed by the Company and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC
Documents") or as set forth in the disclosure schedule (with
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the information set forth in such disclosure schedule relates;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any information set forth in one section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or
subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is apparent on its face)
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Sub as follows:





(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation,
as the case may be, and has all requisite power and authority and possesses
all governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to
enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise
hold and operate



 

8 its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have such government licenses, permits,
authorizations or approvals individually or in the aggregate has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed individually or in the aggregate
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent, prior to the execution of
this Agreement, complete and accurate copies of the Company Certificate and
its By-laws (the "Company By-laws"), and the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date hereof. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
accurate copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not yet
been finalized, drafts thereof (if available)) of all meetings of the
stockholders of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, the Board of
Directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and the committees of
each of such Board of Directors, in each case held since January 1, 2001 and
prior to the date hereof.



(b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
each of the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, the
state of incorporation or formation and, as of the date hereof,
each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do
business. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the
Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances or
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"),
and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose
of such capital stock or other equity interests. Except for the capital stock
of, or voting securities or equity interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or



 

9 other voting securities or equity interests in, any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, association or other entity.



(c) _Capital Structure._ The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 150,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 20,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (of which 50,000 shares have been
designated as Company Preferred Stock). At the close of business on January
31, 2003, (i) 47,042,335 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 261,800 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the
Company in its treasury, (iii) 3,093,355 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the Companys 1996 Non-
Officer Stock Option Plan, as amended, 1992 Equity Incentive Plan, as
amended, and 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") (such plans,
collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), and 7,749,446 shares of Company
Common Stock were subject to outstanding Company Stock Options (other than
rights under the ESPP), and no shares of Company Common Stock were subject to
vesting and restrictions on transfer (collectively, "Company Restricted
Stock"), (iv) 499,100 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance and issuable upon conversion of the Company Preferred Stock, (v)
3,816,793 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance and
issuable upon conversion of the 5.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009
of the Company (the "Company Notes"), (vi) 4,991 shares of Company Preferred
Stock were issued or outstanding, (vii) no other shares of preferred stock of
the Company were issued or outstanding or were held by the Company
as treasury shares and (viii) warrants to acquire 700,000 shares of Company
Common Stock from the Company pursuant to the warrant agreements set forth on
Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and previously delivered in
complete and correct form to Parent (the "Warrants") were issued and
outstanding. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.01(c), at the close
of business on January 31, 2003, no shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of the Company were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. There are no outstanding stock appreciation rights,
"phantom" stock rights, performance units, rights to receive shares of Company
Common Stock on a deferred basis or other rights (other



 

10 than Company Preferred Stock, Company Notes, Company Stock Options and
Warrants) that are linked to the value of Company Common Stock (collectively,
"Company Stock-Based Awards"). Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list, as of February 6, 2003, of
all outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(collectively, "Company Stock Options") and all outstanding Company Stock-
Based Awards, granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (other than
rights under the ESPP), and all outstanding Warrants, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock (or other stock) subject thereto, the grant dates,
expiration dates, exercise or base prices (if applicable) and
vesting schedules thereof and the names of the holders thereof. All
outstanding Company Stock Options (other than rights under the ESPP) and
shares of Company Restricted Stock are evidenced by stock option agreements,
restricted stock purchase agreements or other award agreements, in each case
in the forms set forth in Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and no stock option agreement, restricted stock purchase agreement or other
award agreement contains terms that are inconsistent with such forms. Each
Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the exercise price of each other
Company Stock Option is no less than the fair market value of a share of
Company Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such Company Stock
Option. As of the close of business on January 31, 2003, there were
outstanding Company Stock Options (other than rights under the ESPP) to
purchase 7,749,446 shares of Company Common Stock with exercise prices on a
per share basis lower than the Common Stock Merger Consideration, and the
weighted average exercise price of such Company Stock Options was equal to
$18.46. The maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be
purchased with accumulated payroll deductions under the ESPP at the close of
business of May 30, 2003 and November 28, 2003 (assuming the fair market value
of a share of Company Common Stock on such dates is equal to the Common Stock
Merger Consideration and payroll deductions continue at the current rate) is
112,792 and 70,190, respectively. As of the close of business on January 31,
2003, there were outstanding Warrants to purchase 700,000 shares of Company
Common Stock with exercise prices on a per share basis lower



 

11 than the Common Stock Merger Consideration. All outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company are, and all shares which may be issued pursuant to the
Company Preferred Stock, Company Notes, Company Stock Options, Company Stock-
Based Awards or the Warrants will be, when issued in accordance with the
terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and not subject to preemptive rights. Except for the Company Notes, there are
no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.
Except as set forth above in this Section 3.01(c), (x) there are not issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital stock or other

(d) _Authority; Noncontravention._ The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to
receipt of the Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, to the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other
parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability
of equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Board of Directors of the Company,
at a meeting duly called and held at which all directors of the Company were
present, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) declaring that it is in the best interests of the

promptly as practicable to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company and (iv) recommending that the stockholders of the Company adopt this
Agreement, which resolutions, as of the date of this Agreement, have not been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way. The



 

13 execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
compliance by the Company and its Subsidiaries with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, (x) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the
Company Certificate or the Company By-laws or the comparable organizational
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (y) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or other assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any loan or credit agreement,
bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture, lease, supply agreement, license
agreement, development agreement or other contract, agreement, obligation,
commitment, instrument, franchise or license, whether oral or written (each,
including all amendments thereto, a "Contract"), to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or any of their respective properties or other
assets is subject or (z) subject to the governmental filings, the obtaining of
the Stockholder Approval and the other matters referred to in the following
sentence, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, any (A) statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective properties or other assets or (B) order,
writ, injunction, decree, judgment or stipulation, in each case applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties or other
assets, other than, in the case of clauses (y) and (z), any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Federal, state, local or foreign government, any court,
administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission or
authority or any non-governmental self-regulatory agency, commission or
authority (each, a "Governmental Entity") is



 

14 required by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for (1) the filing of a premerger notification and report
form by the Company under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "HSR Act"),
and the receipt, termination or expiration, as applicable, of approvals or
waiting periods required under the HSR Act or any other applicable
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law or regulation, (2) the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (A) a proxy

Agreement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy
Statement") and (B) such reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (3) the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
states in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do

Nasdaq National Market and (5) such other consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, actions, registrations, declarations and filings the failure
of which to be obtained or made individually or in the aggregate has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



(e) _Company SEC Documents._ The Company has filed all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and other
information incorporated therein) with the SEC required to be filed by the
Company since January 1, 2001 (the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their
respective filing dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC
Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated



 

15 therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent
that information contained in any Company SEC Document has been revised,
amended, supplemented or superseded by a later-filed Company SEC Document,
none of the Company SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements (including the related notes) of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents complied at the time they were filed as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and each fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal year-end audit adjustments). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which individually or in the
aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company are, or have at any time since
January 1, 2001 been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a)
and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 



(f) _Information Supplied._  None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in



 

16 light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except
that no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.



(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with this Agreement or as expressly permitted pursuant to
Section 4.01(a)(i) through (xvi), since the date of the most recent financial
statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice, and there has not been any Material
Adverse Change, and from such date until the date hereof there has not
been (i) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than dividends or
distributions by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
to its shareholders, (ii) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any shares of capital stock or any other
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any options,
warrants, calls or rights to acquire such shares or other securities, (iii)
any split, combination or reclassification of any capital stock of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any issuance or the authorization of any
issuance of any other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution
for shares of their respective capital stock, (iv) (A) any granting by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries of any increase in
compensation, bonus or fringe or other benefits or any granting of any type of
compensation or benefits to any current or former director, officer, employee
or consultant not previously receiving or entitled to receive such type of
compensation or benefit, except for normal increases in cash compensation
(including cash bonuses) in the



 

17 ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or as was required
under any Company Benefit Agreement or Company Benefit Plan in effect as of
the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Filed Company
SEC Documents, (B) any granting by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any right to receive any increase in
severance or termination pay, or (C) any entry by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries into, or any amendments of, (1) any employment, deferred
compensation, consulting, severance, change of control, termination or
indemnification agreement or any other agreement with or involving any current
or former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (2) any agreement with any current or former director,
officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the
benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially
altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company of a
nature contemplated by this Agreement (all such agreements under this clause
(C), collectively, "Company Benefit Agreements"), (D) any adoption of, any
amendment to or any termination of any Company Benefit Plan, or (E) any
payment of any benefit under, or the grant of any award under, or any
amendment to, or termination of, any bonus, incentive, performance or other
compensation plan or arrangement, Company Benefit Agreement or Company
Benefit Plan (including in respect of stock options, "phantom" stock, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, "phantom" stock rights, restricted
stock units, deferred stock units, performance stock units or other stock-
based or stock-related awards or the removal or modification of any
restrictions in any Company Benefit Agreement or Company Benefit Plan or
awards made thereunder) except as required to comply with applicable law or
any Company Benefit Agreement or Company Benefit Plan in effect as of the
date of the most recent financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents, _provided_ , that this clause (iv) shall not apply with respect to
any consultant of the Company who, as of the date of this Agreement, had not
been paid more than $20,000 in one fiscal year by the Company, (v) any damage,
destruction or loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or
in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected



 

18 to have a Material Adverse Effect, (vi) any change in accounting methods,
principles or practices by the Company materially affecting its assets,
liabilities or businesses, except insofar as may have been required by a
change in GAAP or (vii) any change in any material tax election or any
settlement or compromise of any material income tax liability.



(h) _Litigation._ There is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that individually or in
the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, investigation by any Governmental Entity involving,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets that
individually or in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.



(h) _Contracts._ Except with respect to licenses and other agreements relating
to intellectual property, which are the subject of Section 3.01(p), as of the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
and none of their respective properties or other assets is subject to, any
contract or agreement that is of a nature required to be filed as an exhibit
to a report or filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto
is in material violation of or in default under (in each case with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) any of the Contracts set forth in Section
3.01(i)-(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. None of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto
is in violation of or in default under (in each case with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) any Contract (other than the Contracts listed in
Section 3.01(i)-(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), to which it is a
party or by which it or any of its properties or other assets is bound, except
for violations or defaults that individually or in the aggregate have not had
and would



 

19 not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any Contract with any
Affiliate of the Company that is currently in effect other than agreements
that are disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any agreement or
covenant restricting the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ability to
compete.





(i) _Compliance with Laws; Environmental Matters._ (i) Except with respect to
Environmental Laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA") and taxes, which are the subjects of Sections 3.01(j)(ii),
3.01(l) and 3.01(n), respectively, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is in compliance with all statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, regulations,
judgments, orders and decrees of any Governmental Entity applicable to it, its
properties or other assets or its business or operations (collectively,
"Legal Provisions"), except for failures to be in compliance that individually
or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in
effect all approvals, authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises,
licenses, notices and permits of or with all Governmental Entities
(collectively, "Permits"), including all Permits under the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (the "FDCA"), and the regulations of the
Federal Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") promulgated thereunder,
necessary for it to own, lease or operate its properties and other assets and
to carry on its business and operations as presently conducted, except where
the failure to have such Permits individually or in the aggregate has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There
has occurred no default under, or violation of, any such Permit, except for
any such default or violation that individually or in the aggregate has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The consummation of the Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the
revocation or cancellation of any such Permit that individually or in the
aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No
action, demand, requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and
no suit, action or proceeding



 

20  by any other person, in each case with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or other assets under any
Legal Provision, is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
other than, in each case, those the outcome of which individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.



(ii) Except for those matters that individually or in the aggregate have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:
(A) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and has been, in compliance
with all applicable Environmental Laws and has obtained and complied with all
Permits required under any Environmental Laws to own, lease or operate its
properties or other assets and to carry on its business and operations as
presently conducted; (B) there have been no Releases or threatened Releases
of Hazardous Materials in, on, under or affecting any properties currently or
formerly owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(C) there is no investigation, suit, claim, action or proceeding pending, or
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising under Environmental Laws,
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
notice of any such investigation, suit, claim, action or proceeding; (D)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into or assumed by
contract or operation of law or otherwise, any obligation, liability, order,
settlement, judgment, injunction or decree relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws; and (E) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts, circumstances or conditions that would reasonably be expected to form
the basis for any investigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or liability
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or
arising under Environmental Laws. The term "Environmental Laws" means all
Federal, state, local and foreign laws (including the common law), statutes,
rules, regulations, codes, ordinances, orders, decrees, judgments,
injunctions, notices, Permits, treaties or binding agreements issued,
promulgated or entered into by any Governmental Entity, relating in any way to
the environment, preservation or reclamation of natural



 

21  resources or endangered species, the presence, management, Release or threat
of Release of, or exposure to, Hazardous Materials, or to human health and
safety. The term "Hazardous Materials" means (1) petroleum products and by-
products, asbestos and asbestos-containing materials, urea formaldehyde foam
insulation, medical or infectious wastes, polychlorinated biphenyls,
radon gas, radioactive substances, chlorofluorocarbons and all other ozone-
depleting substances or (2) any chemical, material, substance, waste,
pollutant or contaminant that is prohibited, limited or regulated by or
pursuant to any Environmental Law. The term "Release" means any spilling,
leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting,
escaping, leaching, dumping, disposing or migrating into or through the
environment or any natural or man-made structure. 



(k) _Absence of Changes in Company Benefit Plans; Labor Relations._
Except as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(i) through (xvi),
since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Filed
Company SEC Documents, there has not been any adoption or amendment by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any collective bargaining agreement or
any employment, bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock appreciation,
restricted stock, stock option, "phantom" stock, performance, retirement,
thrift, savings, stock bonus, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit,
vacation, severance, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical,
welfare benefit or other plan, program, policy, arrangement or understanding
(whether or not legally binding) maintained, contributed to or required to be
maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
other person or entity that, together with the Company, is treated as a single
employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, a "Commonly
Controlled Entity"), in each case providing benefits to any current or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans"), or any material
change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate
funding obligations with respect to any Company Pension Plans, or any change
in the manner in which contributions to any Company Pension Plans are made or
the basis on  



 

22  which such contributions are determined, other than amendments or other
changes as required to ensure that such Company Benefit Plan is not then out
of compliance with applicable law, or reasonably determined by the Company to
be necessary or appropriate to preserve the qualified status of a Company
Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There exist no currently
binding Company Benefit Agreements. There are no collective bargaining or
other labor union agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound. As of
the date hereof, none of the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are represented by any union with respect to their employment by
the Company or such Subsidiary. As of the date hereof, since January 1, 2001,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any labor
disputes, union organization attempts or work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts
due to labor disagreements.



(l) _ERISA Compliance._ (i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of each Company Benefit Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) (sometimes referred to herein as a "Company Pension Plan"), each
Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other Company Benefit Plans. The Company has
provided or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of (A) each
Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plans,
descriptions thereof), (B) the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500
required to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if any such report was required), (C)
the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan for
which such summary plan description is required and (D) each trust agreement
and insurance or group annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit
Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms. The Company, its Subsidiaries and all
the Company Benefit Plans are all in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws,
including laws of foreign



 

23  jurisdictions, and the terms of all collective bargaining agreements.



(ii) All Company Pension Plans intended to be tax-qualified have received
favorable determination letters from the IRS with respect to "TRA" (as
defined in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 93-39), and have timely filed with the IRS
determination letter applications with respect to "GUST" (as defined in
Section 1 of Notice 2001-42), to the effect that such Company Pension Plans
are qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter has been
revoked (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened)
and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination
letter or application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such
Company Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or
require security under Section 307 of ERISA. In addition, all Company Pension
Plans have been, or shall have been by the end of the 2002 plan year, amended
to comply with the requirements of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 which are or have become effective on or before the
end of the 2002 plan year, as set forth in Notice 2001-42. All Company Pension
Plans required to have been approved by any foreign Governmental Entity have
been so approved, no such approval has been revoked (or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, has revocation been threatened) and no event has occurred since
the date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any
such Company Pension Plan that would reasonably be expected to materially
affect any such approval relating thereto or materially increase the costs
relating thereto. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent a
complete and accurate copy of the most recent determination letter received
prior to the date hereof with respect to each Company Pension Plan, as well as
a complete and accurate copy of each pending application for a determination
letter, if any. The Company has also provided or made available to Parent a
complete and accurate list of all amendments to any Company Pension Plan as to
which a favorable determination letter has not yet been received.



 

24 (iii) Neither the Company nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has (A)
maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to any Company
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or (B) has any unsatisfied
liability under Title IV of ERISA.



(iv) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all Company
Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or distributed
to any Company Benefit Plan participant have been duly and timely filed or
distributed. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received
notice of, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no investigations by
any Governmental Entity with respect to, termination proceedings or other
claims (except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the
Company Benefit Plans), suits or proceedings against or involving any Company
Benefit Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan that would give rise to any material liability, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are not any facts that could give rise to any
material liability in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit or
proceeding.



(v) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of the
date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have
been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference into the Filed Company SEC
Documents. Neither any Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan of
any Commonly Controlled Entity has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code),
whether or not waived.



(vi) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (A) there has not occurred any
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective employees, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of such Company Benefit Plan, or any
agent of the foregoing, has engaged that would reasonably be expected to  



 

25  subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
employees, or a trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trust
created under any Company Benefit Plan, to the tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed
under Title I of ERISA and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other
fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing,
has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a
manner, that would reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary, to any liability for breach of fiduciary
duty under ERISA or any other applicable law. No Company Benefit Plan or
related trust has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event"
(as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day
reporting requirement has not been waived with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan during the last five years, and no notice of a reportable event will be
required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(vii) Section 3.01(l)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses
whether each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan is
(A) unfunded or self-insured, (B) funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as
such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, or other funding mechanism
or (C) insured. Each such employee welfare benefit plan may be amended or
terminated (including with respect to benefits provided to retirees and other
former employees) without material liability (other than benefits then payable
under such plan without regard to such amendment or termination) to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time after the Effective Time. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries complies in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any similar state
statute with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan,
as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code or such state
statute. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
material obligations for retiree health or life insurance benefits under any
 



 

26  Company Benefit Plan (other than for continuation coverage required under
Section 4980(f) of the Code).



(viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction expressly contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of
any termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) will (A)
entitle any current or former director, officer, employee or consultant of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance or termination pay, (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or (C) result in any
breach or violation of, or a default under, any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement. The Companys good faith estimate as of the date

non-cash benefits (other than Company Stock Options and Company Restricted
Stock) that may become payable or provided to any director, officer, employee
or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Company
Benefit Agreements (assuming for such purpose that such individuals

Effective Time were the date hereof) is set forth in Section 3.01(l)(viii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.



(ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability or obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit
Plan, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.



(x) No deduction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any
"applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of
the Code) has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance by reason of
Section 162(m) of the Code.



 

27 (m) _No Excess Parachute Payments._ No amount or other entitlement or
economic benefit that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, the consummation
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(including as a result of termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time) by or for the benefit of any director, officer, employee or
consultant of the Company or any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or
otherwise would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such
term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), and no disqualified
individual is entitled to receive any additional payment from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any other person in the
event that the excise tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed
on such disqualified individual. Section 3.01(m) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the Companys good faith estimate, calculated
as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the "base amount" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for the Companys chief executive
officer and each other disqualified individual (defined as set forth above)
(collectively, the "Primary Company Executives") and (ii) the maximum amount
of "parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Code that could be
paid or provided to each Primary Company Executive as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Stockholder
Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (including as a result of any termination of employment on

the Code (and any applicable U.S. Treasury regulations) or applicable state,
local or foreign tax laws. All such tax returns are complete and accurate in
all material respects. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has paid or
caused to be paid (or the Company has paid on its behalf) all taxes  



 

28  due and owing, and the most recent financial statements contained in the
Filed Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve (determined in
accordance with GAAP) (excluding any reserves for deferred taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and tax income) for all taxes
accrued and payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial
statements.



(ii) No tax return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever
been under audit or examination by any taxing authority, and no written notice

its Subsidiaries. The Company has received no notice of and otherwise has no
knowledge of any deficiency, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter
in controversy with respect to any material amount of taxes due and owing by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each deficiency resulting from any
completed audit or examination relating to material taxes by any taxing
authority has been timely paid or is being contested in good faith and has
been reserved for on the books of the Company. No issues relating to taxes
were raised by the relevant taxing authority in any completed audit or
examination that could reasonably be expected to recur in a later taxable
period and have a material effect on the Company in such later taxable
period. There is no currently effective agreement or other document extending,
or having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or collection of
any taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor has any request been made
in writing for any such extension, and no power of attorney (other than powers
of attorney authorizing employees of the Company to act on behalf of the
Company) with respect to any taxes has been executed or filed with any taxing
authority.

financial statements of the Company included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents) in a prior taxable period (or portion of a taxable period) but was
not recognized for tax purposes in any prior taxable period as a result of (A)
an open



 

29  transaction disposition made on or before the Effective Time, (B) a prepaid
amount received on or prior to the Effective Time, (C) the installment method
of accounting, (D) the completed contract method of accounting, (E) the long-
term contract method of accounting, (F) the cash method of accounting or
Section 481 of the Code or (G) any comparable provisions of state or local
tax law, domestic or foreign, or for any other reason, other than any amounts
that are specifically reflected in a reserve for taxes on the financial
statements of the Company included in the Filed Company SEC Documents.



(iv) The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all applicable
statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of any material amount of taxes (including withholding of taxes
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402 of the Code and similar
provisions under any Federal, state, local or foreign tax laws) and have,
within the time and the manner prescribed by law, withheld from and paid over
to the proper governmental authorities all material amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over under applicable laws.



(v) In the three (3) year period prior to the Effective Time, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" as such terms are defined in
Section 355 of the Code in a distribution of stock outside of the affiliated
group of which the Company is the common parent qualifying or intended to
qualify for tax-free treatment (in whole or in part) under Section 355(a) or
361 of the Code.

30 and its Subsidiaries) (i) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii)_as a transferee or
successor, (iii) by contract or (iv) otherwise.



(viii) No claim has ever been made by any authority in a jurisdiction where
any of the Company or its Subsidiaries does not file a tax return that it is,
or may be, subject to a material amount of tax by that jurisdiction.



(ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any tax sharing agreement, tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to taxes (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to taxes with any
taxing authority).



(x) No taxing authority has asserted in writing any material liens for taxes
with respect to any assets or properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
except for statutory liens for taxes not yet due and payable.



(xi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of
the Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of
the Code.



(xii) As used in this Agreement (A) "tax" or "taxes" shall include (whether
disputed or not) all Federal, state, local and foreign income, property,
sales, use, excise, withholding, payroll, employment, social security, capital

taxes. 



(o) _Title to Properties._ (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
good and valid title to, or valid leasehold or sublease interests or other
comparable contract rights in or relating to all of its properties and other
assets necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted,
except as have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business and except
for defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar
encumbrances that individually or in the aggregate have not materially
interfered with, and would not reasonably be expected to materially interfere
with, its ability to conduct its business as presently conducted. All such
properties and other assets, other than properties and other assets in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a leasehold or sublease
interest or other comparable contract right, are free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens that individually or in the aggregate have not materially
interfered with, and would not reasonably be expected to materially interfere
with, the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective businesses as presently conducted.



(ii) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied with the terms of
all leases or subleases to which it is a party and under which it is in
occupancy, and all leases to which the Company is a party and under which it

Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in possession of the
properties or assets purported to be leased under all its leases, except for
such failure to be in possession that individually or in the aggregate has not

any written notice from the lessor of any event or occurrence that has
resulted or could result (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of
time or both) in a default with respect to any material lease or sublease to
which it is a party. 





 

32 (p) _Intellectual Property._ (i) Section 3.01(p)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, a complete and accurate
list of all patents and applications therefor, registered trademarks and
applications therefor, domain name registrations and copyright registrations
(if any) owned by or licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such
intellectual property rights as listed in Section 3.01(p)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, together with any tradename rights, trade secret or
know-how rights, service mark rights, rights in computer programs or software,
or other type of intellectual property rights that are owned or licensed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and are material to the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are collectively referred to
herein as "Intellectual Property Rights". All Intellectual Property Rights are
either (x) owned by, or subject to an obligation of assignment to, the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all Liens or (y)
licensed to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company free and clear (to the
Knowledge of the Company) of all Liens. There are no claims pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with regard to the ownership or
licensing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Intellectual
Property Rights which individually or in the aggregate have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
provided for in any agreement identified in Section 3.01(p)(v) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries have the legal power to
convey to a successor all of their respective ownership and license interests
in the Intellectual Property Rights.



(ii) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Intellectual Property Rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries have not been infringed, and are not being
infringed, in a manner which individually or in the aggregate has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have used commercially reasonable efforts to investigate the
potential infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights.



(iii) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has infringed or is



 

33 infringing (including with respect to the manufacture, use or sale by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any commercial products or to the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) any intellectual property
rights of any person which individually or in the aggregate have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no intellectual property right or other legal right that
could be asserted by a person to exclude or prevent the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from freely using any intellectual property under its
Intellectual Property Rights that is material to the conduct of the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is
no contractual, legal or other restriction on the use of any
Intellectual Property Rights which are owned by or licensed to the Company,
other than as set forth in the agreements identified in Section 3.01(p)(v) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company and its Subsidiaries have used
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid infringing the valid, enforceable
intellectual property rights of other persons, other than such infringements
which individually or in the aggregate have not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 



(iv) The patent applications listed in Section 3.01(p)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
are (and such material applications that are licensed to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries are to the Companys Knowledge after diligent review)
pending and have not been abandoned, and have been and continue to be timely
prosecuted. All patents, registered trademarks and applications therefor owned
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been (and all such material
patents, registered trademarks and applications licensed to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have been to the Companys Knowledge after diligent
review) duly registered and/or filed with or issued by each
appropriate Governmental Entity in the jurisdiction indicated in Section
3.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all necessary affidavits of
continuing use have been (or, with respect



 

34 to material licenses, to the Companys Knowledge after diligent review have
been) timely filed, and all necessary maintenance fees have been (or, with
respect to material licenses, to the Companys Knowledge after diligent review
have been) timely paid to continue all such rights in effect. None of the
patents listed in Section 3.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that
are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has (and no such material
patents that are licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have to
the Companys Knowledge after diligent review) expired or been declared
invalid, in whole or in part, by any Governmental Entity. There are no ongoing
interferences, oppositions, reissues, reexaminations or other proceedings
involving any of the patents or patent applications listed in Section
3.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and owned by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (or, with respect to material patents or patent
applications, to the Companys Knowledge after diligent review, licensed to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including ex parte and post-grant
proceedings, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or in any
foreign patent office or similar administrative agency, other than such
interferences, oppositions, reissues, reexaminations or proceedings that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company
based on reasonable investigation, there are no published patents, patent
applications, articles or other prior art references, or any other prior art
or material information, that could adversely affect the validity or
enforceability of any patent listed in Section 3.01(p)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule that relates to any of the Specified Compounds or
that is otherwise material to the conduct of the business of the Company or
its Subsidiaries. Each of the patents and patent applications listed in
Section 3.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that are owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries properly identifies (and to the Knowledge
of the Company based on reasonable investigation, such material patents and
applications licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries properly
identify) each and every inventor of the claims thereof as determined in
accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which such patent is issued or
such patent application is pending. Each inventor named on the patents and
patent applications listed in Section 3.01(p)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, alone or
together with any joint owners,



 

35 has executed (and such inventors named on such material patents and
applications licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the
Companys Knowledge based on reasonable investigation, have executed) an
agreement agreeing to assign or actually assigning his or her entire right,
title and interest in and to such patent or patent application, and the
inventions embodied and claimed therein, to the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company, alone or together with any joint owners as appropriate, or in the
case of licensed Patents, to the appropriate owners from whom the Companys
license rights have been duly conveyed. To the Knowledge of the Company based
on reasonable investigation, no such inventor has any contractual or other
obligation that would preclude any such assignment or otherwise conflict with
the obligations of such inventor to the Company or such Subsidiary or
appropriate owners under such agreement with the Company or such Subsidiary or
such appropriate owners, as the case may be.



(v) Section 3.01(p)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all agreements with respect to any options,
rights, licenses or interests of any kind relating to Intellectual Property
Rights granted (x) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
agreements commonly generated in the ordinary course of business (including
software licenses for generally available software, employee assignment
agreements, nondisclosure agreements, consulting agreements, material
transfer agreements, clinical trial agreements and evaluation agreements)
that individually and in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect) or (y) by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any other person (other than agreements commonly
generated in the ordinary course of business (including software licenses for
generally available software, employee assignment agreements, nondisclosure
agreements, consulting agreements, material transfer agreements, clinical
trial agreements and evaluation agreements) that individually and in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect). There are no such options, rights, licenses or interests of
any kind relating to Intellectual Property Rights other than as set forth in
the agreements listed in Section 3.01(p)(v) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. Section



 

36 3.01(p)(v)-(A) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the date
hereof, all agreements under which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is obligated to make payments (in any form, including royalties,
milestones and other contingent payments) to third parties for use of any
intellectual property rights with respect to the commercialization of any of
the Specified Compounds.



(vi) The Company and its Subsidiaries have used reasonable efforts to maintain
their material trade secrets in confidence, including entering into licenses
and contracts that generally require licensees, contractors and other third
persons with access to such trade secrets to keep such trade secrets
confidential.



(vii) Section 3.01(p)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of each application or official request for any
extension (i.e., under Hatch-Waxman) of the term of any patent owned or
licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any commercial
product of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was subject
to regulatory review, including an identification of the patent and the term
extension requested. To the Knowledge of the Company, it or its Subsidiary (as
the case may be) exercised due diligence during the regulatory review of each
such product. To the Knowledge of the Company based on reasonable
investigation, there is no information that would materially affect the
eligibility of such patent for the full period of the term of the extension
requested.



(viii) As used in this Section 3.01(p), "Specified Compounds" means the drug
products or candidates being sold, manufactured, or developed by the Company
that are set forth in Section 3.01(p)(viii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

37 (r) _State Takeover Statutes; Company Certificate Provisions._ The Board of

applicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of Article VII, the approval of
the Board of Directors of the Company referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence constitutes the approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the "Continuing Directors" (as
defined in Article VII) pursuant to paragraph 1(a) of Article VII. No other
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation or similar provision
of the Company Certificate or the Company By-laws applies or purports to apply
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(s) _Brokers and Other Advisors._ No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other person (other than JPMorgan Securities Inc.), the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has delivered to

or with respect to any of the Specified Compounds. Complete and accurate

it (and, in the case of Parent, Sub) fails to comply with or satisfy in any

satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent
shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly provide the other with copies

Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, (A) timely file all tax returns ("Post-Signing Returns")
required to be filed by or on behalf of each such entity; (B) timely pay all

Time; (D) promptly notify Parent of any suit, claim, action, investigation,

SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it

directors, officers or employees or authorize or knowingly permit any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor,
agent or representative (collectively, "Representatives") retained by it or
any of its Subsidiaries to (and shall instruct such Representatives not to),
directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which could
reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, in
response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which
Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after
the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
4.02(a), the Company may, if its Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable law, and subject to compliance with Section 4.02(c), (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a



 

55 customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive as a whole of such
person than the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such
person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.



The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person
or the shareholders of any person would own 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any resulting
parent company of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide offer made by a third party
that if consummated would result in such person (or its stockholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or
substantially all the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger
(taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all



 

56 financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.



(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly
propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors
or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) (an "Acquisition
Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining
the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if such
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, (x) make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) in response to a Superior
Proposal that was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the
date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02,
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement (and concurrently with or after
such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made and
(2) no such termination of this Agreement by the Company may be made, in each
case until after the third business day following Parents receipt of written
notice from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.02(b) and specifying the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is
the basis of the



 

57 proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new
two business day period). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
4.02(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account any
changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to any such written notice by the Company or otherwise. 



(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such Takeover Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity
of the person making any such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
fully informed of the status and material details (including any material
change to the terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal. 



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from
(x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel) failure
to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable
law, including the Board of Directors duty of candor to the stockholders
of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve
to take, any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the period prior to
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records

to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the
taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from

60 (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties; _provided_  that none of the Company, Parent or Sub shall be

requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate with the other party
to the extent necessary to assist the other party in the preparation of
its HSR Filing, to request early termination of the waiting period required

Agreement, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent
to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion
of any business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.



SECTION 5.04. _Company Stock Options; ESPP_. (a) As soon as practicable

Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to effect the following:



(i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options (other than
rights granted under the ESPP), whether vested or unvested, as necessary to
provide that, at the Effective Time, each such Company



 

61 Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
amended and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, the number of
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option by the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below), at a price per share
of Parent Common Stock equal to (A) the aggregate exercise price for the
shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company
Stock Option divided by (B) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option (each, as so
adjusted, an "Adjusted Option"), provided that such exercise price shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The "Option Exchange Ratio" means the
quotient obtained by dividing the Common Stock Merger Consideration by the
Average Closing Price (as defined below) and rounding to the nearest 1/10,000.
The "Average Closing Price" means the amount equal to the average per
share closing price of Parent Common Stock, as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Transaction Tape for the five (5) consecutive trading days
ending with the second trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time;



(ii) adjust the terms of each share of Company Restricted Stock as necessary
to provide that the restrictions on such shares shall lapse at the Effective
Time; and



(iii) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as Parent and the
Company may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger.





(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company administering the ESPP), shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to provide that (i) participants
may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in
effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no offering period shall be
commenced after the date of this Agreement, (iii) each participants
outstanding right to purchase shares of



 

62 Company Common Stock under the ESPP shall terminate on the day immediately
prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs, _provided_ that all
amounts allocated to each participants account under the ESPP as of such date
shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company
Common Stock at the applicable price determined under the terms of the ESPP
for then outstanding offering periods using such date as the final purchase
date for each such offering period and (iv) the ESPP shall terminate
immediately following the purchases of Company Common Stock on the day prior
to the day on which the Effective Time occurs.



(c) The adjustments provided in Section 5.04(a)(i) with respect to any Company
Stock Options that are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of
the Code shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.



(d) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
to the holders of Adjusted Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock Plans and
the agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted Options, including that
such Adjusted Options and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 5.04 after giving effect to the Merger).



(e) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another
appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Adjusted
Options. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained)
at least for so long as any Adjusted Options may remain outstanding.



(f) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 5.04 and except to the
extent required under the respective terms of the Adjusted Options, all
restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to Adjusted
Options awarded under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or
arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent that such
restrictions or



 

63 limitations shall not have already lapsed, shall remain in full force and
effect with respect to such Adjusted Options after giving effect to the
Merger and the assumption by Parent as set forth above.



(g) The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder of a
Company Stock Option (or former holder of a Company Stock Option) or any
participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or any other equity interest
therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights).



SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Advancement of Expenses, Exculpation and
Insurance._ (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the
obligations with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of the Company as provided in the Company Certificate,
the Company By-laws or any indemnification agreement between such directors
or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof),
without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of not less than six years from and after the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six
year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim or claims
shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims.



(b) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.05.



(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain (directly or
indirectly through the Companys existing insurance programs) in effect the



 

64 Companys current directors and officers liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy (a complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore
delivered to Parent), on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of
Parent containing terms with respect to coverage (including as coverage
relates to deductibles and contractual provisions) and amount no less
favorable to such directors and officers or (ii) request that the Company
obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing insurance
programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 5.05(c),
neither the Company nor Parent shall be obligated to pay more than $8,200,000
in the aggregate, less any applicable credit (the "Premium Amount"), to obtain
such coverage. It is understood and agreed that in the event such coverage
cannot be obtained for the Premium Amount or less in the aggregate,
Parent shall be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for the
Premium Amount.



(d) The provisions of this Section 5.05 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.



SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of
this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ , that the fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the printing, filing and mailing to
stockholders of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of the Stockholder
Approval, and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection
with the Proxy Statement, shall be shared equally by the Company and Parent.



(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(e), (ii) this



 

65 Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (iii)
(A) prior to the obtaining of the Stockholder Approval, a Takeover Proposal
shall have been made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly
known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but
only if a vote to obtain the Stockholder Approval or the Stockholders
Meeting has not been held) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 9 months
after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by any
Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to
$70,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in
the case of a payment required by clause (i) above, on the first business day
following the date of termination of this Agreement, (y) in the case of a

Agreement and (z) in the case of a payment required by clause (iii) above, on

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay
the amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made.



SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including



 

66 the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably
conclude may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. The parties agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.



SECTION 5.08. _Stockholder Litigation._ The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be

unreasonably withheld or delayed.



SECTION 5.09. _Employee Matters._ (a) For a period of not less than twelve
months following the Effective Time, the employees of the Company who remain
in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the
"Continuing Employees") shall receive employee benefits that in the aggregate
are substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided under the
Companys employee benefit plans to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
nor any of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to issue, or adopt any
plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of shares of capital stock,
warrants, options, stock appreciation rights or other rights in respect of any
shares of capital stock of any entity or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into such shares pursuant to any such plans or arrangements;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that no plans or arrangements of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries providing for such issuance nor the Companys Flexible
Time Off program shall be taken into account in determining whether employee
benefits are substantially comparable in the aggregate.



(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific person.

each Continuing Employee as if such service had been performed with Parent (i)
for purposes of vesting (but not benefit accrual) under Parents defined
benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of eligibility for vacation under
Parents vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility and participation
under any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent (other than any post-

under Parents severance plan (in the case of each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii)
and (iv), solely to the extent that Parent makes such plan or program
available to employees of the Surviving Corporation), but not for purposes of
any other employee benefit plan of Parent.



(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent
such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such
employees under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in
satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the
extent applicable under any such plan.

Company, Parent and Sub shall take each action required to be taken by such
party pursuant to (i) the Indenture dated as of August 5, 2002 between the

 EXHIBIT A 

TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT



 _Restated Certificate of Incorporation_

_of the Surviving Corporation_



 _FIRST_ : The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the "Corporation")
is Scios Inc.



 _SECOND_ : The address, including street, number, city, and county, of the
registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware is Corporate
Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, County of New
Castle; and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation in the State
of Delaware at such address is The Corporation Trust Company. 



 _THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware.



 _FOURTH_ : The aggregate number of shares which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share.



 _FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon
it by law, the Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized
to adopt, amend or repeal the By-laws of the Corporation.



 _SIXTH_ : To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware as it now exists and as it may hereafter be amended, no
director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director or officer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Article SIXTH shall eliminate or limit the liability
of a director or officer (i) for any breach of the directors or officers
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or (iv) for any transaction from
which the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit. No
amendment to or repeal of this Article SIXTH shall apply to or have any effect
on the liability or alleged liability of any director or officer of the
Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director or
officer occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. _SEVENTH_ : The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section
145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same may
be amended and supplemented, indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have
power to indemnify under said Section from and against any and all of the
expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said
Section. Such indemnification shall be mandatory and not discretionary. The
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person. Any
repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely affect any
right to indemnification of any persons existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to any matter occurring prior to such repeal
or modification.



The Corporation shall to the fullest extent permitted by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware advance all costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by any
director or officer within 15 days of the presentation of same to the
Corporation, with respect to any one or more actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, so long as the
Corporation receives from the director or officer an unsecured undertaking to
repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such director
or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such obligation to advance
costs and expenses shall be mandatory, and not discretionary, and shall
include, without limitation, costs and expenses incurred in asserting
affirmative defenses, counterclaims and cross claims. Such undertaking to
repay may, if first requested in writing by the applicable director or
officer, be on behalf of (rather than by) such director or officer, provided
that in such case the Corporation shall have the right to approve the party
making such undertaking.



 _EIGHTH_ : Unless and except to the extent that the By-laws of the
Corporation shall so require, the election of directors



 

2 of the Corporation need not be by written ballot.
