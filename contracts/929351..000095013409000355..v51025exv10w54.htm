The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall present fairly, on a good faith basis, the estimated financial position of the Network Business as of the Closing Date, subject to the GAAP Exceptions and the Closing Date Balance Sheet Exceptions.

 (c) Stockholder shall have thirty (30) days following the date of delivery by Buyer to Stockholder of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet to provide Buyer with a written certificate confirming that the Net Working Capital as set forth in the Post-Closing Balance Sheet is correct (the "Confirmation Certificate") or notifying Buyer in writing of any good faith reasonable objections to the calculation of the Net Working Capital as set forth on the Post-Closing Balance Sheet (a "Balance Sheet Dispute Notice"), setting forth a reasonably specific and detailed description of such objections.

    ##### 

  

  

faith to resolve any such objections within ten (10) business days of the
receipt by Buyer of the Balance Sheet Dispute Notice. 

   

 (e) If Stockholder and Buyer shall be unable to resolve any such dispute within the ten (10) business day period, Stockholder and Buyer (either together or separately) shall be entitled to submit the dispute to a mutually agreed upon independent accounting firm (the "Independent Accountant") for review and resolution of all matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute, and the Independent Accountant shall make a final determination of the Net Working Capital to the extent such amount is in dispute, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement.

The Independent Accountants determination will be based solely on presentations by Buyer and Stockholder which are in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The Post-Closing Balance Sheet and the determination of the Net Working Capital shall become final and binding on the parties on the date the Independent Accountant delivers its final resolution in writing to the parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be paid by the party determined by the Independent Accountant to be the non-prevailing party in connection with the dispute; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Independent Accountant shall determine in its reasonable discretion that neither party shall be the non-prevailing party, then such fees and expenses shall be borne 50% by Stockholder and 50% by Buyer. 

   

 (f) If Stockholder does not deliver a Balance Sheet Dispute Notice in accordance with Section 3.4(c) above (i.e., within the 30-day period specified therein), the Post-Closing Balance Sheet (together with Buyers calculation of the Net Working Capital set forth on the Post-Closing Balance Sheet) shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that Stockholder delivers a Balance Sheet Dispute Notice in accordance with the provisions above and Stockholder and Buyer are able to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the Post-Closing Balance Sheet, together with the calculation of the Net Working Capital, to the extent modified by the mutual agreement of such parties, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that Stockholder delivers a Balance Sheet Dispute Notice in accordance with the provisions set forth above and Stockholder and Buyer are unable to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties, and the Post-Closing Balance Sheet, together with the calculation of the Net Working Capital, to the extent modified by the Independent Accountant, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (g) In the event that it is determined that the Net Working Capital shall have been overstated in the calculation of the Total Consideration for purposes of the Closing, Stockholder shall deliver to Buyer such overstated amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts as Buyer specifies in written instructions to Stockholder within three (3) business days following the final determination of such amounts pursuant to this Section 3.4. 

   

 (h) In the event that it is determined that the Net Working Capital shall have been understated in the calculation of the Total Consideration for purposes of the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Stockholder such understated amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts as Stockholder specifies in written instructions to Buyer within three (3) business days following the final determination of such amounts pursuant to this Section 3.4. 

   

 3.5 Further Assurances. If, at any time before or after the Closing, any of the parties hereto reasonably believes or is advised by their attorneys that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Closing, then Stockholder, the Company, Buyer and their respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 

  

 3.6 Tax Withholding.

To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (b) Stockholder agrees to furnish Buyer with a non-foreign certification (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.1445-2(b)(2).

If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of this Section 7.4 because taken together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to Buyer the intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that the provisions hereof that, if eliminated, would permit the remaining separate provisions to be 

    ##### 

 

  

enforced in such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated, for the purposes of
such proceeding, from this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 
 BUYER COVENANTS 

   

 Buyer covenants and agrees with Stockholder, Seller and the Company as follows: 

  

 8.1 Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

 (a) Following the Closing and until May 3, 2014, Buyer and the Company shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Closing or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Closing were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 8.1 without limit as to time; _provided_ , that in no event shall such action by Buyer have the effect of increasing or otherwise broadening the scope of the indemnification obligations of the Company to such Persons as in effect immediately prior to the Closing. 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing, following receipt of any undertakings deemed desirable by Buyer or the Company), to the same extent that such Persons are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as in effect as of the Agreement Date, each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the Company (each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party") against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and following receipt of any undertaking deemed desirable by Buyer or the Company), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Action, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, 

   ##### 

  

   

pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the
benefit of the Company, before the Closing; _provided_ , that nothing in this
Agreement (or in such exculpation, indemnification and advancement
provisions) shall require Buyer or its affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries after the Closing) to exculpate, indemnify, or
provide advancement of expenses to any Person in connection with the dispute
arising under or related to this Agreement or any transaction or agreement
entered into in connection with this Agreement. In the event of any such
Action, Buyer and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action. 

   

 (c) Following the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 8.1. 

   

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Person may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any other indemnification arrangement, Applicable Law or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 8.1 shall survive the Closing and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (e) In the event Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.1. 

   

 8.2 Employee Matters. 

  

 (a) On the tenth business day preceding the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Buyer a revised version of Section 4.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, updated to reflect all changes in such section that have occurred prior to such day. No later than the fifth business day preceding the anticipated Closing Date but effective as of the Closing Date and contingent on the Closing, Buyer shall offer employment to all of the Employees listed on the revised Section 4.14(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide Buyer with access to such Employees and (ii) assist Buyer in extending offers of employment to such Employees. Buyer shall offer such employment on an "at will" basis and at a wage and salary level (excluding performance-based or incentive compensation, bonuses and equity-based compensation, as applicable) that is the same as that provided to the applicable Employee on the day preceding the Closing Date. Each such offer that is made to an Employee who is actively employed in the Network Business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date shall be an offer to commence employment on the Closing Date. Each such offer that is made to an Employee who is not actively at work with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries due to a short- or long-term disability leave or other leave of absence (but not including vacation), will be deemed to be an offer of employment with Buyer effective as of the date such Employee is willing and able to return to active work status (the 

    ##### 

  

    

"Start Date"). The Company shall promptly notify Buyer if any Employees
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries either (i) commences a
short- or long-term disability leave or other leave of absence (but not
including vacation) during the period of time commencing with the Agreement
Date and ending on the Closing Date, or (ii) returns to active employment from
any such leave from the Agreement Date to the Closing Date. Each Employee to
whom an offer of employment is made pursuant to this Section 8.2(a) and who
accepts such offer and commences such employment with Buyer as of the Closing
Date or Start Date, as applicable, shall be referred to as a
"Retained Employee" and collectively as the "Retained Employees." 

   

 (b) From and after the Closing, except as expressly set forth herein, the Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, honor all compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Closing and as set forth in the offers of employment pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof, _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the amendment or termination of any such arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms and Applicable Law. Following the Closing (other than in the case of health benefits, which will be provided no later than the first day of the first month following the Closing) and at all times until May 3, 2009, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Retained Employee and former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Stockholder terminated by, or pursuant to an agreement with, the Company or its Subsidiaries or Stockholder (a list of which former employees is set forth on Section 8.2(b) of the Disclosure Schedule) ("Company Employees") compensation and benefits (other than an employee stock purchase plan) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to Company Employees immediately before the Closing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Buyer shall or shall cause the Company to provide Company Employees whose employment terminates following the Closing and prior to May 3, 2009 with severance benefits in accordance with the Gemstar Change in Control Severance Policy (a copy of which has been provided to Buyer prior to the Agreement Date), and (ii) during such period following the Closing, severance benefits offered to Company Employees shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after May 2, 2008 in compensation paid to such Company Employees. Notwithstanding any term in this Section 8.2(b) to the contrary, nothing in this Section 8.2(b) shall be deemed to restrict the ability to hire or terminate the employment of any current or former Employees following the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereby agree that Buyer shall cause the Company to be responsible for the payment of the expenses set forth in Section 8.2(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule and that Seller shall be responsible for the payment of the expenses set forth in Section 8.2(b)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Stockholder providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Closing (the "New Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Stockholder and their respective predecessors before the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing, or if there was no such credit for such service under a similar employee benefit plan, under Stockholders 401(k) Plan; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to 

   ##### 

  

   

benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans, and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, Buyer and the Company shall cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors in which such employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing and Buyer and the Company shall cause any eligible expenses incurred
by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
Closing ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. 

   

 (d) Except for (i) the Company Benefit Plans listed on Section 8.2(d) of the Disclosure Schedule that Buyer is assuming and (ii) the obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2(b) hereof, the parties understand and agree that Buyer is not assuming any Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan, and under no circumstances shall Buyer or its affiliates have any obligation under, or incur any liability in respect of, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, other than payment obligations pursuant to the two employment agreements being assumed by Buyer with terms which extend beyond May 3, 2009 and except to the extent Buyer either takes action after the Closing or consents to Seller taking action prior to the Closing to the contrary, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall not have any liability for any severance, change of control, or other similar payments in respect of any Retained Employee who is terminated on or after May 3, 2009. 

   

 8.3 Nonsolicitation. For a period of one (1) year from and after the Closing Date (the "Nonsolicitation Period"), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Stockholder, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire (or cause to leave the employ of a party or its Subsidiaries, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) any employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries unless such Person ceased to be an employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries due to Parents or such Subsidiarys termination of such Person without cause, or, in the case of such Persons voluntary termination of employment with Parent or its Subsidiaries, at least nine (9) months has elapsed between such Persons voluntary termination and such action by Buyer or any of its affiliates as the soliciting party. In addition, neither Buyer nor any of its affiliates shall, directly or indirectly through another Person, during the Nonsolicitation Period, (i) call on, solicit or service any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in order to induce or attempt to induce such Person to cease doing business with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including making any negative statements or communications about Parent or any of its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that nothing in this subpart (ii) shall be deemed to impede 

   ##### 

  

 

Buyers and its affiliates ability to independently discuss their independent
contractual and proposed contractual relations with such entities without
reference to any relationship between Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, and
such entities. 

   

 8.4 Cooperation with Contractual Obligations. The parties agree to cooperate with each other on the matters set forth in Section 8.4 of the Disclosure Schedule.

If either party received any formal or informal request for supplemental information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, then the recipient of such request shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request and, in making any such response, the responding party shall consider in good faith the views of the other party hereto.

   ##### 

  

   

Antitrust Laws; (ii) Buyer and Stockholder shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under Antitrust Laws.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section or this Agreement shall be construed to require Parent or its Subsidiaries to litigate any claims for insurance against any of its insurers, or to maintain any insurance coverage of the Network Business following the Closing.  Further, to the extent any insurance payment for an Insurable Event is received after the Closing by Parent, and not by the Company or its Subsidiaries, Parent shall promptly remit such payment to Buyer. For the further avoidance of doubt: (i) following the Closing, Buyer may, as it deems appropriate at its sole effort and expense, pursue (or continue to pursue on behalf of the Additional Insureds) insurance claims as to Insurable Events, and (ii) events occurring after the Closing are not subject to this covenant and shall be Buyers sole responsibility to seek insurance coverage therefor as it deems appropriate at its sole effort and expense.

 (b) Either of Buyer or Stockholder by giving written notice to the other, if the Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by Section 3.1 hereof shall not have been consummated by midnight Pacific Time on June 30, 2009 (the "End Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if by the End Date the conditions set forth in Section 10.1(b) shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions shall be satisfied (other than conditions, which conditions remain capable of being satisfied, set forth in Section 10.2 and Section 10.3), the End Date may be extended by either Buyer or Stockholder in its discretion (in which case, all other parties shall be bound by such extension), for three (3) months from its scheduled expiry (in which case any references to the End Date herein shall mean the End Date as extended); _provided further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.2(b) shall not be available to any party whose breach of a representation or warranty or covenant made under this Agreement by such party is the proximate cause of the failure of any condition set forth in Article X to be fulfilled or satisfied on or before such date. 

   

 (c) Buyer, by giving written notice to Stockholder, if the Company, Seller, Stockholder or Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.1 or 10.2 or failure of the Closing to occur and (ii) cannot be cured by within thirty (30) days; 

    ##### 

  

    

 _provided_ , that Buyer shall have given the Company written notice,
delivered at least fifteen (15) days prior to such termination, stating
Buyers intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.2(c) and the basis for such termination (and such matter shall not
have been cured); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not have a right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.2(c) if Buyer is then
in breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Sections 10.1 or 10.2. 

   

 (d) Stockholder, by giving written notice to Buyer, if Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 10.1 or 10.3 or failure of the Closing to occur and (ii) cannot be cured by the within thirty (30) days; _provided_ , that Stockholder shall have given Buyer written notice, delivered at least fifteen (15) days prior to such termination, stating Stockholders intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.2(d) and the basis for such termination (and such matter shall not have been cured); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Stockholder shall not have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.2(d) if Stockholder or the Company is then in breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Sections 10.1 or 10.2. 

   

 11.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 11.1 or 11.2, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, Stockholder, the Company or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the provisions of Section 9.3 (Confidentiality), this Section 11.3 (Effect of Termination) and Article XIV (Miscellaneous) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability in connection with any breach of any of such partys representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. 

  

ARTICLE XII 
 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, INDEMNIFICATION 
 AND REMEDIES; CONTINUING COVENANTS 

   

 12.1 Survival. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, schedule or document delivered hereunder shall survive the Closing Date until the Expiration Date; _provided_ , that the representations contained in Section 4.6 and indemnifications contained in Article XIII shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations plus thirty (30) days; _provided further_ , the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1, 5.1 and 6.1 relating to organization and existence, Sections 4.4, 5.2, and 6.2 relating to authority, Section 5.3 relating to the Equity Interests, Section 4.3 relating to capitalization, and Section 4.20 relating to brokers fees and finders fees (such sections are collectively referred to herein as the "Core Representations"), and any representation in the case of fraud, shall survive indefinitely. Any covenant or agreement to be performed after the Closing Date shall survive in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate will continue to survive if a Claim Notice (as defined below) shall have been given on or prior to such 

   ##### 

  

    

termination date in good faith based on facts reasonably expected to establish
a valid claim under this Article XII, until the related claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this
Article XII. The parties hereto agree that reliance shall not be an element
of any claim for misrepresentation or indemnification under the Agreement.
The indemnification provisions set forth in (a) Sections 12.2(i) and 12.3(i)
shall survive until the Expiration Date, and (b) Sections 12.2(ii), 12.3(ii)
and 12.3(iii) shall survive indefinitely. 

  

 12.2 Indemnification by Seller and Parent. After the Closing Date and subject to the additional provisions set forth in this Article XII, Seller and Parent shall, jointly and severally, indemnify Buyer and Buyers stockholders and Representatives (including without limitation the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives) (each a "Buyer Indemnitee") against, and hold each Buyer Indemnitee harmless from, any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, payments and obligations, and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and costs of settlement (collectively "Losses"), incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be paid, directly or indirectly, by, or imposed upon, such Buyer Indemnitee resulting from, related to or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy as of the Agreement Date or the Closing Date of any representation or warranty of the Company or Stockholder contained in this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements delivered to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements; and (ii) any breach by the Company or Stockholder or Seller or Parent or any failure of the Company or Stockholder to perform any of the covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements delivered to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements. 

  

 12.3 Indemnification by Buyer. After the Closing Date and subject to the additional provisions set forth in this Article XII, Buyer shall indemnify Stockholder and Stockholders respective stockholders and Representatives (each a "Stockholder Indemnitee") against, and hold each Stockholder Indemnitee harmless from, any and all Losses, incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be paid, directly or indirectly, by, or imposed upon, such Stockholder Indemnitee resulting from, related to or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements delivered to Stockholder pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements; (ii) any breach by Buyer or any failure of Buyer to perform any of the covenants contained in this Agreement or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements delivered to Stockholder pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements; and (iii) any claim by any third party brought against any Stockholder Indemnitee to the extent arising from the operation of the Network Business by Buyer or its affiliates (except to the extent such claim arises from a breach of a representation or warranty by the Company or Stockholder Indemnitee) following the Closing Date. 

  

 12.4 Third Party Claims. 

  

 (a) If any Buyer Indemnitee or Stockholder Indemnitee (each referred to as an "Indemnitee") receives notice of the assertion by any third party of any claim or of the commencement by any such third party of any action (any such claim or action being referred to herein as an "Indemnifiable Claim") with respect to which Stockholder or Buyer (each referred to as "Indemnitor") are or may be obligated to provide indemnification, the Indemnitee shall 

   ##### 

  

   

promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing (the "Claim Notice") of the
Indemnifiable Claim;  _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice
shall not relieve or otherwise affect the obligation of the Indemnitor to
provide indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that any Losses
directly resulted or were caused by such failure. 

   

 (b) The Indemnitors shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice (unless the claim or action requires a response before the expiration of such thirty-day period, in which case the Indemnitors shall have until the date that is ten (10) days before the required response date) to acknowledge responsibility and undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, and at its expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnitees shall cooperate with the Indemnitors in connection therewith; _provided_ , that (i) the Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnitee to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee, _provided_ , that the fees and expenses of such Indemnitees counsel shall not be borne by the Indemnitors; (ii) the Indemnitor shall not settle any Indemnifiable Claim without the Indemnitees consent if the settlement (A) requires the Indemnitee to admit wrongdoing, pay any fines or refrain from any action, (B) does not include a full release of Indemnitee or (C) may reasonably be expected to impact the ongoing operations of the Network Business; and (iii) if, in the opinion of counsel to the Indemnitor, either (x) the Indemnitee has separate defenses from the Indemnitor, (y) there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and Indemnitee or (z) there is any danger of criminal liability of the Indemnitee, then the Indemnitee shall be permitted to retain special counsel of its own choosing at the reasonable expense of the Indemnitor. So long as the Indemnitor is vigorously contesting any such Indemnifiable Claim in good faith, the Indemnitee shall not pay or settle such claim without the Indemnitors consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice (or before the date that is ten (10) days before the required response date, if the claim or action requires a response before the expiration of such thirty-day period), that it acknowledges responsibility and elects to undertake the defense of the Indemnifiable Claim described therein, the Indemnitee shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the Indemnifiable Claim in the exercise of its reasonable discretion; _provided_ , that the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor of any compromise or settlement of any such Indemnifiable Claim. 

   

 12.5 Limits on Indemnification. 

  

 (a) Except with respect to claims for equitable remedies, claims by any party hereto based on actual fraud with intent to deceive in the making of the representations and warranties in this Agreement ("fraud"), or claims relating to Tax Matters (Section 4.6 and Article XIII), following the Closing Date, no Indemnitor shall have an indemnification obligation for any amount for Losses arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Sections 12.2(i) or 12.3(i), as appropriate, in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the Total Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof, and no Indemnitor shall have any indemnification obligation for any amount of Losses arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Sections 12.2(i) or 12.3(i), as appropriate, except for claims relating to Tax Matters (Section 4.6 and Article XIII) until the total amount of resulting Losses exceeds three-fourths percent (0.75%) of the Total Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof (the "Threshold 

   ##### 

  

   

Amount"), after which time the Indemnitor shall be liable only for the amount
of Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount; _provided_ , that the foregoing
limitations shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the
untruth or breach of any representation or warranty made in any Core
Representation or to any representation or warranty in the event of fraud. The
amount of any Losses indemnifiable by either party pursuant to this Article
XII shall be adjusted to reflect the value of any insurance proceeds actually
received (net of any deductibles, retention or self-insurance) by the
Indemnitee or its successors or assigns in respect of such Losses; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnitee shall have any obligation to
pursue such insurance proceeds or recovery from third Persons. If any such
proceeds or recoveries are received by an Indemnitee with respect to any
Losses after a party hereto has made a payment to an Indemnitee with respect
to such Losses, the Indemnitee shall pay to such party the amount of
such proceeds or recoveries (up to the amount of such partys payment with
respect to such Losses). If an Indemnifiable Claim can be asserted pursuant
to more than one clause of Section 12.2 or 12.3, as applicable, then the
applicable Indemnitee can elect the clause pursuant to which to assert
such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that an Indemnitee cannot be compensated
for the same Loss more than once and all Losses shall be calculated net of
any actual recovery of an Indemnitee. For each Indemnifiable Claim, an
Indemnitor shall only be liable for total Losses incurred as a result of such
Indemnifiable Claim, which Losses shall be calculated net of any actual
recovery of an Indemnitee, regardless of the number of Indemnitees that may
have rights pursuant to such Indemnifiable Claim. Claims for Losses made
pursuant to (a) Sections 12.2(i) and 12.3(i) may be made at any time prior to
the Expiration Date and (b) Sections 12.2(ii), 12.3(ii) and 12.3(iii) may be
made indefinitely. 

   

 (b) Except for Buyers obligation to pay the Total Consideration with respect to Buyer, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the total recovery of a party for Losses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby exceed the Total Consideration actually paid by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 12.6 Escrow. At Closing, Buyer will deliver fifteen percent (15%) of the Total Consideration to the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, which Indemnity Escrow Fund shall serve as a source of recovery in the event of a Claim against Seller or Parent pursuant to this Article XII. Buyer hereby agrees that it shall first seek a remedy from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the extent of the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund with respect to any indemnification claim asserted hereunder before seeking to recover any Losses from Seller or Parent. 

  

 12.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except in the case of fraud or the pursuit of specific performance of the covenants and agreements in this Agreement, following the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of an Indemnitee for Losses hereunder or for any amounts owing to an Indemnitee shall be to seek indemnification from the Indemnitor in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Article XII. 

  

 12.8 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Each of Buyer and Stockholder agrees to treat any payment made by Stockholder under this Article XII as an adjustment to the Total Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 12.9 Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge. If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Buyer expressly reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy under Section 12.2(i) or Section 12.2(ii) for any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company or Stockholder contained in this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements delivered to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements, or any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements delivered to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or the Company Ancillary Agreements, notwithstanding (a) any investigation by, disclosure to or knowledge of Buyer in respect of any fact or circumstances that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before or after the execution and delivery hereof or (b) any waiver of such breach in connection with the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer waives its rights to indemnity or any other remedy for Losses arising out of or relating to the breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement, but only to the extent Buyer expressly waived the satisfaction or compliance of such covenant by the Company and failed to reserve its rights to seek indemnification in connection with the delivery of such waiver. 

  

ARTICLE XIII 
 CERTAIN TAX MATTERS 

   

 13.1 Transfer Taxes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and such other Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Stockholder when due and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and Stockholder shall at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns if required by Applicable Law. 

  

 13.2 Section 338(h)(10) Election; Allocation of ADSP. 

  

 (a) Section 338(h)(10) Elections. In connection with the sale of the Equity Interests contemplated hereby, the parties hereto shall cause an express election pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to be made for the Company and its corporate Subsidiaries and shall cause similar elections to be made where appropriate for state Tax purposes (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election"). No later than thirty (45) days prior to the last date on which the Section 338(h)(10) Election must be filed, the Buyer will deliver to the Parent and Stockholder all forms and other schedules and documents necessary to file the Section 338(h)(10) Election, with instructions to Stockholder and Parent with respect to the signing and filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, and Stockholder and Parent will comply with such instructions in signing and filing the Section 338(h)(10) Election. 

   

 (b) Allocation. Within ninety (90) days following the Closing, the Buyer shall prepare and provide to Stockholder and Parent an allocation of the "aggregate deemed sales price" ("ADSP") among the assets of the Company and affected Subsidiaries (the "Allocation") in accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 13.2 of the Disclosure Schedule. The Allocation shall be set forth on Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 8883 (and any schedule required to be attached thereto) to be filed by the parties. Should there be any disagreement with 

   ##### 

  

   

respect to the Allocation and/or filing Form 8883, the matter will be referred
to the Independent Accountant, who will determine the final and binding
allocation of the ADSP within thirty (30) days of such referral, taking into
account the methodology set forth in Section 13.2 of the Disclosure Schedule,
which determination will thereupon be conclusive and binding on Parent, Buyer
and Stockholder for all tax purposes. The costs of such accountants will be
shared equally by Buyer and Stockholder. Buyer and Stockholder each agree to
file their respective federal and state income Tax Returns, reports and
forms, including IRS Form 8883, in a manner consistent with said
Allocation. 

   

 13.3 Tax-Sharing Agreements. Any Tax-sharing agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent or Stockholder, on the other, is terminated as of the Closing and shall have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year or a past year). 

  

 13.4 Indemnification for Post-Closing Transactions. Buyer shall indemnify Parent, Stockholder and their affiliates for any additional tax owed by any of them resulting from any transaction engaged in by any of the Company or any Subsidiary not in the ordinary course of its business occurring on the Closing Date after the Effective Time, which transaction was initiated by Buyer. 

  

 13.5 Post-Closing Transactions not in Ordinary Course. Buyer and Parent agree to report all transactions not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Effective Time in respect of Company or any Subsidiary on Buyers federal Income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). 

  

 13.6 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes for Periods through the Closing Date. Parent shall include the Company and the Subsidiaries that are members of the selling consolidated group in Parents consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and report income, gain and loss attributable to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. For all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Subsidiaries that are members of the selling consolidated group to join in Parents consolidated federal income Tax Return and, in jurisdictions in which the Acquired Companies have in the past been included in state combined or consolidated Tax Returns, join in such Tax Returns. Parent and Stockholder shall file the federal and applicable state and foreign Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods through the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice, except as required by a change in Applicable Law. Stockholder shall indemnify Buyer and its affiliates for any unpaid Taxes relating to any Period through the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries that are included in the Tax Returns to be filed under this paragraph by Parent, Stockholder or any Subsidiary of Parent, to furnish information to Parent, Stockholder or any Subsidiary of Parent as reasonably requested to allow Parent, Stockholder or any Subsidiary of Parent to satisfy its obligations under this section in accordance with past custom and practice. Buyer shall cause the Company and Subsidiaries to file all other Tax Returns to be filed after the Closing Date. Parent and Stockholder shall indemnify Buyer and its affiliates for (i) any Taxes relating to or attributable to a period ending on or before the Closing Date, other than any Taxes taken into account as a liability in the Post-Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with Section 3.4, and (ii) all Taxes relating to or attributable to the Section 

   ##### 

  

 

338(h)(10) Election. In respect of a Tax Return with a period that starts
before or on but does not end on the Closing Date, this amount shall be
deemed to be equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax
Return ended on the Closing Date. In respect of a Tax that is based upon a
time period, such Tax shall be pro rated based upon the number of days prior
to the Closing Date. 

   

 13.7 Responsibility for Taxes for Periods after the Closing Date. Buyer shall indemnify Stockholder and its affiliates for any Taxes relating to a period after the Closing Date, other than Taxes for which Stockholder and Parent are required to indemnify Buyer under this Agreement. 

  

 13.8 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer, Stockholder and Parent shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article XIII and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer agrees to (A) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or Stockholder, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) give Stockholder reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if Stockholder so requests, Buyer shall allow Stockholder to take possession of such books and records. 

  

 13.9 Tax Proceedings. Stockholder and Buyer shall jointly control the defense and settlement of any Tax audit, administrative or court proceedings (each, a "Tax Proceeding") relating to any Tax Return that includes income, gain, loss or Transfer Taxes (including Transfer Taxes to which Section 13.1 applies) attributable to ordinary course and non-ordinary course transactions ending prior to or on Closing Date and reportable in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date. Stockholder shall control the defense and settlement of any Tax Proceeding at its own expense, relating to any Tax Return that does not include income, gain, loss or Transfer Taxes (excluding Transfer Taxes to which Section 13.1 applies) attributable to ordinary course and non-ordinary course transactions ending after the Closing Date; provided that Buyer shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Proceeding and to approve the settlement or disposition thereof if such settlement or disposition could adversely affect the tax liability of Buyer, the Company or its Affiliates for tax periods ending after the Closing Date. 

  

ARTICLE XIV 
 MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 14.1 Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction. The internal laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto. Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by the other party or its 

   ##### 

  

    

successors or assigns shall be exclusively brought and determined in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware. 

  

 14.2 Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall not be assignable (whether in whole or in part) by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that Buyer may assign this Agreement to any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries prior to the Closing, subject to such subsidiary making all of Buyers representations and warranties in Article VI to Seller (treating itself as if it were the Buyer thereunder) prior to the assignment. No such assignment shall modify Buyers obligation to pay the Total Consideration hereunder except to the extent fulfilled by Buyers wholly-owned subsidiary assignee. Any assignment in violation of this provision shall be void. 

  

 14.3 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any circumstance shall be invalid or unenforceable, such term or provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, and the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties further agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent practicable, the economic, business and other purposes of the invalid or unenforceable provision. 

  

 14.4 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by one party hereto to the other parties hereto by facsimile or e-mail transmission of a photocopy of the original signature page hereto, and upon receipt of such facsimile or e-mail transmission will be deemed to have the same effect as if the original signature had been delivered to the other parties. The parties shall endeavor to exchange the original signature copies, but the failure to deliver the original signature copy and/or the nonreceipt of the original signature copy shall have no effect upon the binding and enforceable nature of this Agreement. 

  

 14.5 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction. 

  

 14.6 Amendments and Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or 

   ##### 

  

    

in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively), only by a
writing signed by Buyer, the Company, and Stockholder (on behalf of
Stockholder). The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the
performance hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. At any time prior to the Closing,
each of the Company, Buyer, and Stockholder may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to it contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or extension
shall be effective unless signed in writing by the party against whom such
waiver or extension is asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of
the provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of
such party thereafter to enforce such provisions. 

  

 14.7 Expenses. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, whether or not the Purchase and the other transactions contemplated hereby are successfully consummated, each party shall bear its respective legal, accountants, and financial advisory fees and other expenses incurred with respect to this Agreement, the Purchase and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that if the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, such fees and expenses shall be borne and paid by Seller and not by the Company or its Subsidiaries. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such party arising from a breach of this Agreement by the other party. 

  

 14.8 Attorneys Fees. Except as expressly set forth in Section 3.4(e), should any Action be brought to enforce or interpret any part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys fees to be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal). The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of any Action, regardless of whether such Action proceeds to final judgment. 

  

 14.9 Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered in Person, sent by facsimile and followed by certified first-class postage pre-paid mail, sent by certified or registered first-class mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier service. Such notices and other communications shall be effective upon receipt if hand delivered or sent by facsimile, three (3) business days after mailing if sent by mail, and one business day after dispatch if sent by express courier, to the following addresses, or such other addresses as any party may notify the other parties in accordance with this Section 14.9:
