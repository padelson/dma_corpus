to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (a)
Seller agrees to sell and assign to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase and
acquire from Seller the Assigned Equity, and (b) Seller agrees to cause its
Affiliates SPCP Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _SPCP
Group_ ") and SPCP Group III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("

and assign to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase and acquire from the ORRI

behalf of itself and each of SPCP Group and SPCP Group III, for the Assigned
Equity and to the ORRI Sellers for the Acquired ORRIs shall in the aggregate

an acquisition by Buyer of the underlying assets of the Acquired Company. No

and the Assigned Equity (the " _Allocated Values_ ").

the Purchase Price and any liabilities assumed by Buyer under this Agreement

notice to and discussions with the other Party, or with such other Partys
prior consent. If there is an adjustment to the Purchase Price, Seller shall
revise the Purchase Price Allocation.

contained in this _Article 3_ , for the purposes of determining the amount of

Agreement or any certificate related hereto and delivered at Closing shall be
read without giving effect to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
qualification with a similar meaning contained or incorporated directly or

3.6 _Notice of Claims_. If a Claim is asserted against a Person for which a
Party may have Indemnity Obligations under this Agreement (an " _Indemnity
Claim_ "), the indemnified Person shall give the indemnifying Party written
notice of the underlying Claim setting forth the particulars associated with
the underlying Claim (including a copy of the written underlying Claim, if
any) as then known by the indemnified Person and the indemnified Persons
basis for the request for indemnification under this Agreement (" _Indemnity
Claim Notice_ "). The indemnified Person shall, to the extent practicable,
give an Indemnity Claim Notice within such time as will allow the indemnifying
Party a reasonable period in which to evaluate and timely respond to the
underlying Claim; provided that a failure to do so shall not affect an
indemnified Persons rights hereunder except for, and only to the extent of,
any incremental increase in the cost of the Indemnity Claim resulting from the
failure to give notice or the indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay.

3.7 _Defense of Non-Party Claims_. Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice
involving a Non-Party for which an indemnifying Party believes it may have an
obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the indemnifying Party shall, if
it so elects in accordance with this _Section 3.7_ (without prejudice to its
right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement or its
Indemnity Obligations), assume the defense of the Non-Party Claim with counsel
selected by the indemnifying Party, and the indemnified Person shall cooperate
in all reasonable respects. If any Non-Party Claim involves a fact pattern
wherein each Party may have an obligation to indemnify the other Party, each
Party may assume the defense of and hire counsel for that portion of the Non-
Party Claim for which it may have an obligation of indemnity. In all
instances, the indemnified Person may employ separate counsel and participate
in the defense of any Non-Party Claim; provided, that if the indemnifying
Party has assumed the

 



13  defense of a Non-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ and has agreed
to indemnify the indemnified Person, the fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the indemnified Person shall be borne solely by the indemnified Person. If
the indemnifying Party elects by written notice to undertake the defense of
the Non-Party Claim within 30 Days after receipt of the Indemnity Claim
Notice, then (i) the indemnifying Party shall defend the indemnified Person
against such Non-Party Claim, (ii) the indemnifying Party shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
Non-Party Claim that (A) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff
or claimant in the matter releases the indemnified Person from all liability
with respect to such Non-Party Claim, or (B) would restrict such indemnified
Persons ability to conduct its business in the ordinary course, and (iii)
the indemnified Person shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to such Non-Party Claim without the
indemnifying Partys prior written consent. If the indemnifying Party has not
elected to undertake the defense of a Non-Party Claim, or if the indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of a Non-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 3.7_
but fails to diligently defend against the Non-Party Claim within 30
Days following any written notice from such indemnified Person asserting such
failure, then the indemnified Person shall have the right to defend, at the
sole cost and expense of the indemnifying Party (to the extent the indemnified
Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), the Non-Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings. In such instances, the indemnified Person shall have
full control of such defense and proceedings; provided, the indemnified Person
shall not settle such Non-Party Claim without the written consent of the
indemnifying Party; provided further, if the indemnifying Party fails to
notify the indemnified Person in writing as to whether or not it consents to
such settlement within 30 Days following its receipt of notice of such
settlement from the indemnified Person, then such consent shall be deemed
given. The indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense
or settlement controlled by an indemnified Person pursuant to this  _Section
3.7_, and the indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
_Section 3.7_, if the indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to
the indemnified Person under this _Section 3.7_ and if such dispute is
resolved in favor of the indemnifying Party, the indemnifying Party shall not
be required to bear the costs and expenses of the indemnified
Persons defense pursuant to this _Section 3.7_.

3.8 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Each of the Parties expressly waives
and releases, and shall cause its Affiliates to waive and release, and no
Party shall be liable with respect to consequential, special, punitive,
remote, unforeseeable, indirect, speculative and exemplary damages in
connection with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

3.9 _Exclusive Remedy_ _._ THE PARTIES HAVE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO
DEFINE THEIR RIGHTS, LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS RESPECTING THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCLUSIVELY IN CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS
AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT; AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY

OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ORAL OR IN
WRITING, OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING
RELEASING CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY). WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE

CLAIMS RELATING TO ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

AGREEMENT AS ITS OWN FREE ACT. EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WARRANTS THAT IT HAS BEEN

any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
Houston Division of the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Texas or any Texas state court sitting in Houston, so long as one of such
courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or
proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of
Texas, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction
of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court.
