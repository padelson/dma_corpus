Unless expressly provided for in this Section 2.2, Buyer shall not assume and

-14- 2.3 _Procedures for Assets Not Transferable; Mixed Contracts_.

 

(a) If any Purchased Contracts or Permits are not assignable or transferable
to Buyer without the Consent of any Governmental Authority or Third Party,
and such Consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing Date and the
Closing occurs (a " _Nonassignable Contract or Permit_ "), this Agreement, the
Bill of Sale and the Assignment and Assumption Agreements shall not
constitute an assignment or transfer thereof unless and until such Consent is
obtained. In such case, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such Consent as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
one another in obtaining such Consent. Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Buyer the benefit of any Nonassignable Contract
or Permit to the extent permitted by applicable Law (and Buyer shall assume
and indemnify pursuant to Article XIII Seller from, any and all obligations
thereunder) and to enforce, at the request of Buyer, any rights of Seller
arising from any such Nonassignable Contract or Permit to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, including the right to elect to terminate in

assignment or transfer thereof except to the extent provided in this Section
2.3(b). In such case, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to separate such Mixed Contract as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date so that each of Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to
the rights and benefits and shall assume the related portion of any
Liabilities inuring to their respective business. If any Mixed Contract
cannot be so separated, Buyer and Seller shall take such other commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) the benefits associated with that portion of
each Mixed Contract that relates to the Business, Purchased Asset or Assumed
Obligations to be enjoyed by Buyer; (ii) the obligations associated with that
portion of each Mixed Contract that relates to the Business, Purchased Assets
or Assumed Obligations to be borne by Buyer; (iii) the benefits associated
with that portion of each Mixed Contract that relates to the Excluded Assets,
Excluded Obligations or any of Sellers other businesses other than the
Business to be enjoyed by Seller; and (iv) the obligations associated with
that portion of each Mixed Contract that relates to the Excluded Assets,
Excluded Obligations or any of Sellers other businesses other than the

commercially reasonable, to effect the transfer to Buyer of all leases
necessary to comply with Section 2.2(c). Buyer and Seller shall each

Buyer to be on substantially the same as the terms of Sellers leases as of
the date hereof.

than two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, an employee of Seller and

practicable (but in no event more than five (5) Business Days) following such
physical examination, such employee of Seller and a representative or employee
of Buyer shall summarize such Inventory calculations on a report (the "
_Inventory Report_ ") and deliver the Inventory Report to Buyer and Seller.
The Inventory Report shall be executed and delivered by each of Buyer and
Seller to the other party, and the quantity of such Inventory set
forth thereon, absent manifest error, shall be final and binding on Buyer and
Seller for purposes of calculating Net Working Capital on the Closing Date

Report shall be determined in accordance with the accounting methods,
practices, policies, procedures and estimation methods used to prepare the
Balance Sheet.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90)

determination of the amount of such reduction or increase in the Purchase
Price in accordance with this Section 3.5.

 

(d) Upon receipt of the calculation of the Final Purchase Price, Seller shall
be permitted during the succeeding forty-five (45) day period (the "Review
Period") reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to (i) the Books and

Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price, including a
reasonable level of supporting documentation used by Buyer in preparation of
the Final Purchase Price, and (ii) the accounting personnel of Buyer
supporting the Business and involved in the preparation of the Final Purchase
Price and the Final Balance Sheet.

(e) If Seller disagrees with the Final Balance Sheet or the calculation of
the Final Purchase Price, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement with the Final
Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Final Purchase Price, which notice
shall set forth any such disagreement in reasonable detail, the specific item
of the Final Balance Sheet or the calculation in the Final Purchase Price to
which such disagreement relates and the specific basis for each such
disagreement (the " _Objection Notice_ "). If Seller fails to deliver the
Objection Notice within the Review Period, the Final Balance Sheet and Buyers
calculation of the Final Purchase Price shall be deemed to have been accepted
by Seller and shall be final and binding and used in computing the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount. If Seller delivers the Objection Notice within the
Review Period, subject to Section 3.5(f) below, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement, and any resolution
agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto.

 

(f) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as contemplated
by Section 3.5(e) within 60 days after delivery of the Objection Notice, then
Buyer and Seller shall submit the matter for resolution to a mutually
agreeable independent international accounting firm (the " _Independent
Auditor_ "), who shall, acting as an arbitrator, resolve the dispute set
forth in the Objection Notice. In the event Buyer and Seller are unable to
agree on an Independent Auditor within thirty (30) days after the expiration
of such 60-day period, at the request of either party the Independent Auditor
shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association. The fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne equally by the parties.

 

(g) The parties shall instruct the Independent Auditor to consider only those
items and amounts which are identified in the Objection Notice as being items
which Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve. Further, the Independent
Auditors determination shall be based solely on the relevant Books and
Records and the other written information provided by Buyer and Seller (i.e.,
not on the basis of an independent review), and the Independent Auditor shall
not conduct additional discovery in any form.

 



-21- (h) The parties shall jointly instruct the Independent Auditor to make
a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other
time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after its engagement (i)
whether or not the Final Balance Sheet was prepared, and the Final Purchase
Price was calculated, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or,
alternatively, (ii) only with respect to the disputed items submitted to the
Independent Auditor, to what extent (if any) the Final Balance Sheet or the
Final Purchase Price requires adjustment. The Independent Auditor shall
provide the parties with a written explanation in reasonable detail of each
such required adjustment, including the basis therefor. All negotiations
pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
comparable state rules of evidence, and all negotiations and submissions to
the Independent Auditor shall be treated as confidential information. The
Independent Auditor shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality
agreement. The procedures of this Section 3.5 are exclusive and, except as set
forth below, the determination of the Independent Auditor shall be final and
binding on the parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this Section 3.5(h)
may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either
party may seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to
enforce any decision under this Section 3.5(h). The other partys only
defense to such a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall
be fraud by or upon the Independent Auditor. Absent such fraud, such other
party shall reimburse the party seeking enforcement for its expenses related
to such enforcement.

3.6 _Tax Allocation of Consideration_. No later than ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare, and deliver to Seller the proposed
allocation of the Consideration paid by Buyer (and/or its Affiliate(s)
designated pursuant to Section 2.1) to Seller pursuant to this Agreement
among the Purchased Assets for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code. The
proposed allocation shall be based on an appraisal of the fair market value of
the Purchased Assets by an appraiser mutually agreed upon and selected by
the parties hereto. The proposed allocation shall be conclusive and shall be
binding upon both Seller and Buyer unless Seller objects in writing within
forty-five (45) days after receipt of such proposed allocation. In the event
that Seller objects in writing within forty-five (45) days, Seller and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If Seller and Buyer fail
to resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days following Sellers written
objection, such dispute shall be submitted for resolution to the Independent
Auditor selected in accordance with Section 3.5(f). Promptly, but not later
than thirty (30) days after its acceptance of appointment hereunder, the
Independent Auditor shall determine (based solely on applicable Law and the
prior appraisal and proposed allocation and not by an additional appraisal)
the fair market value of the Purchased Assets solely for purposes of such
allocation under this Section 3.6. If such determination is made by the
Independent Auditor, it shall be binding upon both Seller and Buyer and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Each of Buyer and
Seller shall bear and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by the
Independent Auditor. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees to file Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 and all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in
accordance with such agreed allocation (giving effect, consistent with
such allocation, to mutually-agreed upon adjustments as a result of
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement). Each of Seller
and Buyer shall report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements for federal income Tax and all other Tax purposes in a
manner consistent

 



-22-  with the allocation determined pursuant to this Section 3.6, and, except as
otherwise required by Law, neither party nor their respective Affiliates shall
take a Tax position that is inconsistent with the allocation. Each of Seller
and Buyer agrees to provide the other promptly with any other information
reasonably required to complete such Form 8594 and any amended Form 8594, if
applicable. Each of Seller and Buyer shall notify and provide the other with
reasonable assistance in the event of an examination, audit or other
proceeding regarding the agreed upon allocation of the Purchase Price.

Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to put in place arrangements to
permit such disclosure without violating such Contracts or contravening such
Laws or fiduciary duties). During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall provide
Buyer, within a reasonable period of time, all inquiries or other information
received from a Governmental Authority or any other Third Party regarding any
pending Permit application and shall allow Buyer reasonable opportunity to
participate in responding to any such inquiries, in each case to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws. All information and access provided to Buyer or
its representatives pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially

States federal or state Law and as soon as reasonably practicable for filings
required under any foreign Law) make all required filings with Governmental
Authorities required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the

(c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
each of Seller or Buyer may have with Governmental Authorities in the Ordinary
Course of Business and not relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure
containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the other party
hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the
intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such
analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the
other party with respect to any substantive meeting, discussion, appearance
or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other
party with

 



-42-  the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion,
appearance or contact. Each party shall (i) furnish to the other party such

required by a Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and

restricted to "Outside Antitrust Counsel Only" and any such information shall
not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of
the other party without approval of the party providing the non-public
information.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement other than as set
forth below in this Section 6.5(d) shall require, or be construed to require,

interests of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; or (ii) any material
modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (each of

mining or manufacturing assets Buyer or its Affiliates acquired subsequent to
the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement.

 

6.6 _No Shop_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller and its officers,
directors and Affiliates shall not, and Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its consultants, agents, advisors and representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, consultant, agent,
advisor, representative, Affiliate or otherwise, solicit, initiate or
conduct any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any non-public
information to or otherwise knowingly cooperate in any other way with, or
knowingly facilitate or encourage any effort to attempt to, or enter into any
agreement or understanding with, any Person or group of Persons regarding any
Competing Transaction. Seller shall promptly (and in any event within two
Business Days) notify Buyer of (a) of the receipt by Seller or any of its
officers, directors or otherwise of any inquiries, or proposals or requests
for information concerning a Competing Transaction, or (b) Seller becoming
aware that any such inquiries or proposals have been received by Sellers
attorneys, accountants or other representatives, and shall provide Buyer with
a reasonably detailed summary of all written materials relating to such
inquiries, proposals or requests; provided, however, that Seller shall not be
required to disclose the identity of the

 



-43-  Person making such inquiries or proposals. A " _Competing Transaction_ "
means any of the following (other than any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement): (x) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, or other similar transaction involving the
Business (other than such a transaction involving Parent), (y) any sale,
lease, exchange, dividend, mortgage, pledge, license, transfer or other
disposition of the Business or the Purchased Assets (in a single transaction
or a series of related transactions), or (z) any agreement, or public
announcement by Seller of a proposal, plan or intention, to do any of
the foregoing.

6.7 _Notifications_. Until the Closing, each party hereto shall promptly
notify the other party in writing of (a) any fact, change, condition,
circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of which it is aware
that will or is reasonably likely to result in such partys inability to
satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Article X of this Agreement and
(b) any commencement of or known threat to commence any Action by a
Governmental Authority with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Leased Real Property or the transactions contemplated hereby. Any such
notification shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement,
including for purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained
in this Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth
in Article X have been satisfied.

6.8 _Title Commitment and Survey_.

 

(a) Seller has made available to Buyer title commitments (the " _Title
Commitments_ ") for each Owned Real Property and each Leased Real Property
from First American Title Insurance Company (the " _Title Company_ ") together
with copies of all exception documents listed therein. At Buyers election,
Buyer shall be entitled to procure from the Title Company an ALTA Form B
owners title insurance policy for Owned Real Properties and a leasehold title
insurance policy for Leased Real Properties with standard exceptions and with
normal and customary endorsements for properties similar to the Owned Real
Property and the Leased Real Property (including without limitation, Florida
form endorsements relating to contiguity and survey and ALTA 9.1, 9.2-06
and/or 9.5-06 endorsements, provided that such endorsement shall be issued in
accordance with the Title Companys underwriting guidelines and standards)
(the " _Title Policies_ "). Seller has also made available to Buyer recently
prepared aerial "express maps" of the Owned Real Property produced by an
affiliate of the Title Company (the " _Survey_ "). All costs associated with
the preparation of the Title Commitment and Survey and premiums for the Title
Policy shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in equal amounts; provided that all
costs for Title Policy endorsements shall be borne by Buyer. Notwithstanding
the foregoing to the contrary, the term "Title Commitments" with respect to
the title commitments issued for the Ammonia Lease and the Phosphate Lease
(each, as defined in Schedule 1I) includes modifications to such title
commitment to include requirements that must be satisfied as a condition to
insuring Buyers real property interest thereunder, including, without
limitation, easement, access or other appurtenant rights, and berthing rights
currently provided for under the Ammonia Lease, but only to the extent such
berthing rights are an insurable real property interest in such jurisdiction
and insurable by the Title Company, it being specifically acknowledged by
Buyer that the Title Company has advised the parties of its intention, as of
the date hereof, to include a specific exception for such berthing rights in
the Title Commitment for the Ammonia Lease.

  



-44- (b) If the Title Commitment, Survey or other evidence of title discloses a
title defect, exceptions to title or other Encumbrance, other than a
Permitted Encumbrance, Buyer shall notify Seller within twenty (20) Business
Days of receiving all of the title evidence requested by this Section 6.8.
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure each title
objection as an exception to the Title Commitment prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Seller shall take all actions and prepare all documents necessary to
effect the transfer to Buyer of all Owned Real Properties.

6.9 _Retained Names_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, no interest in or right to use the name "CF Industries", or any
other corporate name of Seller or its Affiliates, or any logo, trademark,
service mark, domain name or trade name or any derivation thereof of Seller or
its Affiliates with respect to, or associated with, the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Retained Names and Marks_ ") is being transferred to
Buyer pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby, and, except as
expressly provided below, the use of any Retained Names and Marks
in connection with the Business shall cease as of the Closing Date. Buyer,
will, and will cause its Affiliates to (a) as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date, but in any event within sixty (60) days
thereafter, remove or obliterate all the Retained Names and Marks from its
signs, purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads, shipping
documents and other items and materials of the Business and otherwise, and (b)
not put into use after the Closing Date any such items and materials that
bear any Retained Name or Mark or any name, mark or logo similar thereto.

6.10 _Financial Assurance Amount_. In accordance with applicable Law, Seller
shall take all commercially reasonable actions necessary with the applicable
Governmental Authorities to withdraw the entire Financial Assurance Amount
(such withdrawn amounts, the " _Withdrawn Amounts_ ") effective on the day
prior to the Closing Date (and prior to such time, shall continue to fund the
Financial Assurance Amount as required by applicable Law). In accordance with
applicable Law, as of the Closing Date Buyer shall take all commercially
reasonable actions necessary with the applicable Governmental Authorities to
deposit an amount into an escrow account established with the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection and trust fund established pursuant to
the Consent Decree as required by applicable Law.

6.11 _Material Contracts Schedule_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a schedule setting forth all
Contracts which, if existing at as of the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth on Section 4.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

not directed specifically to any such employees.

(c) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 7.1
are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer and

jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in
this Section 7.1 and each provision hereof are severable and distinct
covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such
covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable

unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only with respect to that portion
of the materials provided relating to the Business. Seller shall, and shall
cause its officers, directors, employees, Affiliates, agents and other
representatives to, hold in confidence to the

 



-46-  same extent that Seller holds in confidence its other confidential

7.6 _Insurance_. Effective at the Closing, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain its Insurance Policies with respect to pre-
Closing matters relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets. Upon
request by Buyer, Seller shall submit, and use commercially reasonable efforts

matters on behalf of Buyer. Buyer shall pay the costs of such processing and
the deductibles under such Insurance Policies for claims related to the
Business and the Purchased Assets.

 



-47- 7.7 _Transition Services_. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith the

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

8.1  _Tax Matters_.

(a) Each of Buyer and Seller shall bear one half of all sales, use, value-
added, stamp, transfer, registration, and similar Taxes which may become due
and payable and are required to be paid in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Buyer and Seller
agree to cooperate with and assist each other in any efforts to minimize, or
secure any available exemptions from, any such transfer or similar Taxes. Each
of Buyer and Seller shall bear one half of all fees in the nature of
recording, filing, transfer and other similar fees (and the fees and costs of
any title company retained to effect any such recordations, filings or
transfers) required to be paid in connection with the transfer of the
Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Obligations pursuant to
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any agreement, document or
instrument contemplated herein or therein.

(b) On or before the Closing, all state and local real and personal property
Taxes, ad valorem and similar Taxes and assessments (" _Property Taxes_ ")
which have become due and payable upon any of the Purchased Assets on or
before the Effective Time shall be paid by Seller, together with any penalty
or interest thereon, to the relevant Governmental Authority. All Property
Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Purchased
Assets that are due and payable with respect to a Taxable period beginning
before the Effective Time and ending after the Effective Time (taking into
account whether such Property Taxes are payable in advance or in arrears)
shall be apportioned between (i) the period beginning before and ending at
the Effective Time (the " _Pre-Transfer Period_ "); and (ii) the period
beginning on the day immediately after the Effective Time and ending on the
last day of the relevant Taxable period (the " _Post-Transfer Period_ "). In
performing such apportionment, all Property Taxes shall be prorated on the
assumption that an equal amount of Property Tax applies to each day of the
relevant Taxable period regardless of how installment payments are billed or
made. If the actual amount of any such item is not known as of the Effective
Time, such proration will be based on the previous years assessment of such
item and the parties will adjust such proration and pay any underpayment or
reimburse for any overpayment 

 



-48-  within 30 days after the actual amount becomes known. Seller shall be liable
for all such Property Taxes apportioned to the Pre-Transfer Period. Buyer
shall be liable for all such Property Taxes apportioned to the Post-Transfer
Period and all Property Taxes allocable to Taxable periods beginning on or
after the date immediately after the Effective Time.

 

(c) After the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of any Post-
Transfer Period and other Property Taxes for which Buyer is liable under
Section 8.1(b) and which Seller has paid prior to the Effective Time. No later
than 15 days prior to the due date thereof, Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount of any Pre-Transfer Period and other Property Taxes for which Seller
is liable under Section 8.1(b) and which remain unpaid as of the Effective
Time. Buyer shall pay all Property Taxes which become due and payable after
the Effective Time with respect to a Taxable period beginning before the
Effective Time and ending after the Effective Time.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.1(b) with respect to
Property Taxes, Seller shall, at its expense, prepare or cause to be
prepared, and timely file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns with respect
to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Obligations or the trust or
escrow accounts that hold the Financial Assurance Amount for all Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Effective Time, including Tax Returns that are due
after the Effective Time, and shall pay all Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Returns.

 

(e) After the Closing Date, each of Buyer and Seller shall make available to
the other party and its representatives such records as such party may
reasonably require for the preparation of any Tax Returns or other similar
governmental reports or forms relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets
and required to be filed by such party, as well as such additional records as
such party may reasonably require for the defense of any audit, examination,
administrative appeal or litigation concerning any such Tax Return or other
similar governmental report or form. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to timely
sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) the Taxes
referred to in this Section 8.1(e) including, without limitation, providing
all applicable resale certificates (or other similar documentation) and
registering as a licensed vendor in any state or local jurisdiction as may be
required to claim exemption from or reduction of Tax. To the extent any Tax
information may be relevant with respect to any Tax matters of the other
party hereto, each of Seller and Buyer agrees to preserve and make reasonably
available to the other, such information, records and documents, in the
original form if in existence, until the expiration of any applicable
statutes of limitations or extensions thereof and as otherwise required by
Law.

(f) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, as applicable, report the transfer of the
Equipment and Fixed Assets as an occasional or isolated sale under Section
12A-1.037 of the Florida Administrative Code.

 



-49- ARTICLE IX

 

 _EMPLOYEES AND BENEFIT PLANS_

 

9.1 _Offers of Employment_.

 

(a) Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer reasonable access to Sellers
premises and the Books and Records to the extent permitted by applicable Law
and necessary to make the employment offers to Transferred Employees. A "
_Transferred Employee_ " shall be an Affected Employee who (i) is eligible to
be employed in the United States, and (ii) is either (1) actively performing
services for Seller immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (2) is on
Family and Medical Leave Act or similar state-law family or pregnancy leave,
military leave, short-term disability leave or other leave protected by
federal, state or applicable local Law (other than workers compensation
leave). Buyer and Seller agree to announce to Affected Employees within
fifteen (15) days of this Agreement that Buyer intends to offer employment to
Affected Employees as provided under this Section 9.1 and consistent with
Section 9.3(d), contingent upon approval of the transactions contemplated
hereby by federal regulators. No later than five (5) days before
the Effective Time (or, with respect to the Transferred Employees set forth
on Schedule 7.1(b), on or before such date set forth in Schedule 7.1(b)),
Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, offer each Transferred
Employee an offer of employment contingent upon the Transferred Employee
completing all necessary paperwork and other legal requirements for Buyer to
employ the Transferred Employee. In addition, if an Affected Employee is not
actively at work with Seller as of the Effective Time due to a workers
compensation injury and the Affected Employee is certified as being able to
return to work within twelve (12) months of the Effective Time, Buyer shall,
or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, make an offer of employment to such
Affected Employee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1.
Effective immediately before the Effective Time (or, in the case of an
Affected Employee out on workers compensation, when the Affected Employee is
certified as being able to return to work), Seller shall terminate the
employment of all the Transferred Employees, and all Transferred Employees
shall commence employment with Buyer effective as of the Effective Time.

 

(b) It is expressly understood and agreed that (i) Buyers offers of
employment set forth in this Article IX shall not constitute any commitment,
Contract or understanding, express or implied, of any obligation on the part
of Buyer to a post-Closing employment relationship of any fixed term or upon
any terms or conditions other than those that Buyer may establish pursuant to
individual offers of employment; and (ii) employment offered by Buyer is "at
will" and may be terminated by Buyer or by an employee at any time for any
reason (subject to any written commitments to the contrary or requirements of
Law). Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict in any
way the right of Buyer to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any of the
Transferred Employees after the Effective Time or to change adversely
or favorably the title, powers, duties, responsibilities, functions,
locations, salaries, or compensation or terms or conditions of employment of
such employees. Buyer acknowledges that, with respect to a Transferred
Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer following the Effective
Time, it, and not Seller, shall be responsible for any severance obligations
to such terminated Transferred Employees.

 



-50- 9.2 _Vacation_. Seller agrees to be solely responsible and liable for all
unused earned and, as applicable, accrued or banked vacation or paid time off
for all Transferred Employees through the Closing Date, and hereby agrees to
provide a cash payment to all such Transferred Employees in an amount equal to
the cash equivalent of all earned and, as applicable, accrued or banked
vacation or paid time off (but not including any sick time or any time off
that is not required by Law to be paid to such employees upon termination of
employment) based upon the Transferred Employees wage or salary on the day
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for any vacation earned
after the Effective Time by any Transferred Employees under Buyers policies.

 

9.3 _Salaries, Benefits, 401(k) Plan, and COBRA_.

 

(a) Seller shall be responsible for (i) the payment of all wages, benefits,
deferred compensation, equity-based compensation and other remuneration due
to Affected Employees for services performed up until the Effective Time; and
(ii) the provision of health plan continuation coverage in accordance with the
requirements under Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of title I of ERISA
and the regulations thereunder (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to Affected
Employees who experience a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of COBRA)
under any Employee Plan. Buyer shall be responsible for (x) the payment of
all wages, benefits, deferred compensation, equity-based compensation and
other remuneration due to Transferred Employees for services performed after
the Effective Time; and (y) the provision of health plan continuation
coverage in accordance with the requirements under COBRA for any Transferred
Employees who experience a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of COBRA)
incurred after the Effective Time under any employee benefit plan of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates.

(b) Seller shall retain all of Sellers Employee Plans and all obligations
and Liabilities related to such Employee Plans (including for any claims made
or incurred by Affected Employees and their beneficiaries); _provided_ that,
for the avoidance of doubt, this shall not prevent the transfer of assets from
Sellers defined contribution plan and trust (the " _Seller s 401(k) Plan_")
to the defined contribution plan and related trust for non-bargained employees
maintained by Buyer (the " _Buyer s 401(k) Plan_") as provided under Section
9.3(e). Buyer does not assume any of Sellers Employee Plans or any
obligations or Liabilities of such Employee Plans, or any obligations,
Liabilities or benefit plans provided to any employees or former employees of
Seller or its ERISA Affiliates. Buyer shall not have any obligations or
Liabilities under any Employee Plan or to Seller, Sellers ERISA Affiliates,
or any of their employees, former employees, or beneficiaries, other than the
actions required to be taken to effectuate Section 9.3(e).

(c) Seller agrees to notify Buyer as soon as practicable, but no later than
five (5) Business Days, following the receipt of a request for information or
other communication from the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation or any
other Governmental Authority regarding the Qualified Employee Plans. Seller
shall file all 

 



-51-  reports required due to the purchase of the Business with the Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation and any other Governmental Authority in a timely
manner and will provide a copy of all reports to Buyer at the same time they
are filed with such Governmental Authority.

(d) Buyer agrees that the starting base salary paid to each Transferred
Employee by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as reflected in the offers of
employment pursuant to Section 9.1(a), shall be the same after the Effective
Time as paid to such Transferred Employee by Seller immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Buyer may change a Transferred
Employees base salary based on its compensation policies and changes to a
Transferred Employees duties. Buyer agrees that following the
Effective Time, each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate in
an incentive compensation plan maintained by Buyer. Buyer agrees that from and
following the Effective Time each Transferred Employee shall be permitted to
participate in Buyers broad-based benefit plans, programs and arrangements
offered to similarly situated employees employed by the Buyer, subject to the
eligibility and other terms of Buyers broad-based benefit plans, programs and
arrangements. For each Transferred Employee, Buyer will credit such
employees period of service with Seller and any of its Affiliates and
predecessors from the Transferred Employees hire date (based on Section
4.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule) through the Effective Time for purposes
of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefits plans, programs,
policies or arrangements of Buyer or its Affiliates. Buyer also agrees to
credit Transferred Employees as having satisfied a pro-rata portion of the
deductibles, coinsurance and out-of-pocket maximums under Buyers health,
pharmacy benefit, dental and vision plans based on the number of months that
have passed in the plan year before the Effective Time (e.g., if the
Effective Time occurs in April, each Transferred Employee shall be credited
with 4/12ths of the deductibles, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums for
the year).

 

(e) Seller agrees to provide Buyer with the most recent favorable
determination letter for Sellers 401(k) Plan. Buyer agrees after the
Effective Time to allow (i) a trustee-to-trustee transfer of the accounts of
Transferred Employees whose accounts do not contain an funding source (such as
Roth contributions) not allowed under Buyers 401(k) Plan, and (ii) a
rollover of the accounts of the remaining Transferred Employees excluding any
funding source (such as Roth contributions) not allowed under the Buyers
401(k) Plan. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer with respect to
the trustee-to-trustee transfer. Buyer agrees to allow Transferred Employees
to make all elections permitted under Buyers 401(k) Plan. The transfer of
assets shall be conducted in accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code,
Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(l)-1 and Section 208 of ERISA. During the
period after the Effective Time and before the transfer of assets, with
respect to any Transferred Employee whose account is to be transferred under
trustee-to-trustee transfer and who has an outstanding participant loan
balance under Sellers 401(k) Plan, with respect to each payroll payment to
such Transferred Employee with an outstanding loan under Sellers 401(k) Plan,
Buyer shall deduct from the Transferred Employees pay the loan payment(s)
due by the Transferred Employee and timely forward the amounts to the trustee
of the Sellers 401(k) Plan for crediting against the Transferred Employees
loan.

 



-52- (f) Buyer and Seller agree that they shall implement a retention incentive
plan for certain key Affected Employees. The key Affected Employees are
listed on Schedule 9.3(f). Buyer and Seller shall work in good faith to agree
upon a form of such retention incentive plan on or prior to November 18, 2013,
which shall be substantially consistent with the retention incentive plan
attached as part of Schedule 9.3(f). To receive the retention incentive
payment, a key Affected Employee must (i) be continuously employed by Seller
through the Effective Time, and (ii) be continuously employed by Buyer from
the Effective Time through the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time (or, if the transactions contemplated hereby are not approved by
governmental regulators, employed by the Seller through the date that is six
months after the date of the cancellation of the transactions contemplated
hereby). Provided that a key Affected Employee satisfies the retention
incentive plan requirements, Buyer or Seller (as applicable under the
retention incentive plan) shall pay the key Affected Employee a lump sum
payment of the retention incentive on the date provided by under the retention
incentive plan. Within five (5) Business Days of such payment, (i) if Buyer
pays the amounts under the retention incentive plan, then Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the retention
incentive paid to the key Affected Employees, and (ii) if Seller pays the
amounts under the retention incentive plan, then Buyer shall reimburse Seller
for fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the retention incentive paid to the
key Affected Employees.

 

9.4 _General Employment Provisions_.

other actions with respect to the plans, programs and policies described in
this Article IX as may be necessary to carry out the arrangements contemplated
hereby.

 

(b) Seller and Buyer shall each provide the other with such plan documents and
summary plan descriptions, employee data or other information as may be

regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Employee Plan or
other employee benefit plan for any purpose. Nothing in this Article IX shall
be construed to (i) limit the right of Seller, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend or terminate any Employee Plan or any other
employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, or (ii) require Buyer or
any of its Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular Transferred
Employee for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date.

Section 13.2(a)(i) or (ii) Section 13.2(a)(iv) with respect to any breach or
failure to perform the covenants or agreements set forth in Sections 6.1 and

(c) The parties agree that, for purposes of Sections 13.2(a)(i), (ii) and
(iii) and Sections 13.3(a)(i) and (ii), the amount of the Losses (and not the
existence of a breach) shall be determined without giving effect to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications contained in
such representations and warranties.

 

(d) The amount for which an Indemnifying Person shall be liable with respect
to any Loss shall be reduced (i) to the extent that the Indemnified Person
shall theretofore have actually realized any net proceeds recovered from Third
Parties (other than insurers) with respect to such Loss and (ii) by the amount

its subsidiaries) due to the incurrence of such Loss. If an Indemnified Person
shall have received or shall have had paid on its behalf an indemnity payment
with respect to a Loss and shall subsequently receive, directly or
indirectly, such proceeds, then the Indemnified Person shall promptly pay to
the Indemnifying Person the net amount of such proceeds or, if less, the
amount of such indemnity payment. The Indemnified Person shall have no
obligation to take any action to file claims under applicable policies to
recover insurance proceeds that may be due to the Indemnified Person in order
to mitigate the Indemnifying Persons obligations hereunder.

 



-60- (e) No party shall have any right to indemnification hereunder with respect

or otherwise.

for which an Indemnified Person seeks indemnification hereunder.

Third Party Claim with respect to which indemnity may be claimed pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice
to the Indemnifying Person of such claim or the commencement of any such Third
Party Claim, which notice shall include a good faith estimate of the amount
the Indemnified Person estimates that it is entitled to receive hereunder with
respect to such Third Party Claim from the Indemnifying Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Person to give notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this
Article XIII unless and to the extent (if any) that such failure causes the
Indemnifying Person to forfeit any material rights or defenses by reason of
such failure.

 

13.6 _Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim or, by giving written
notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) the Indemnifying Persons counsel is reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (b) the Indemnifying Person shall
thereafter consult with and update the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified
Persons reasonable request from time to time; and (c) the Third Party Claim
involves only monetary damages and does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief or does not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified
Person, based on the advice of counsel, involve a conflict of interest. If the
Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have
the right (but not the obligation) to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Indemnifying Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the
Indemnifying Person fails to actively and diligently conduct the defense of
such Third Party Claim, then in such event, upon twenty (20) days notice
during which time such failure to so conduct the defense of such Third Party
Claim is not cured, the Indemnified Person may hire separate counsel, and
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Person. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend
or prosecute any such Third Party Claim, all of the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.

 



-61- 13.7 _Settlement or Compromise_. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not settle
such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Person consents in writing. If
the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person (which may be withheld in the Indemnified Persons sole
discretion), enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim if such settlement,
compromise or judgment (x) does not include an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Person and its Affiliates from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim or (y) imposes equitable remedies or any obligation on the
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates other than solely the payment of
money damages for which the Indemnified Person will be indemnified hereunder.
If the Indemnified Person is conducting the defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Person shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

13.8 _Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act_. In the event that the
Indemnifying Person does not elect to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim, then (a) the Indemnified Person shall (upon further notice to the
Indemnifying Person) have the right to undertake the defense of such Third
Party Claim; and (b) any failure of the Indemnified Person to defend or
to participate in the defense of any such Third Party Claim shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder or, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, otherwise impose an obligation to defend
the Indemnified Person hereunder.

13.9 _Direct Claims_. As soon as is reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of a claim or Loss with respect to which indemnity may be claimed
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall promptly give
notice to the Indemnifying Person of such Direct Claim, which notice shall
include a good faith estimate of the amount the Indemnified Person estimates
that it is entitled to receive hereunder with respect to such Direct Claim
from the Indemnifying Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of
the Indemnified Person to give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations under this Article XIII unless and to the extent (if
any) that such failure causes the Indemnifying Person to forfeit any material
rights or defenses by reason of such failure. The Indemnifying Person will
have a period of thirty (30) calendar days within which to evaluate and
respond in writing to any Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Person does not
pay such Direct Claim within such 30 day period, the Indemnifying Person will
be deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim, in which event the Indemnified
Person will be entitled to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Person.

 

13.10 _Additional Provisions Related to Environmental Indemnification_.

 

(a) The following additional procedures, terms and limitations shall also
apply with respect to Sellers indemnification obligations pursuant to
Sections 13.2(a)(ii) and 13.2(a)(vi):

(i) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Person pursuant to Section 13.5, the provisions of Sections 13.6, 13.7 and
13.8 shall apply with respect to Third Party Claims and the provisions of
Section 13.9 shall apply to Direct Claims.

 



-62- (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Buyer shall have the right
to determine, either by and through its direct defense of a matter or by and
through its participation in the defense of a matter assumed by Seller, in its
reasonable discretion (subject to its obligation to consult with Seller as
provided herein) any or all of the following as they may arise in a matter
subject to this Section 13.10: (a) the measures, methods or actions to be
taken to correct or mitigate noncompliance with any Environmental Law after
the Effective Time; (b) the manner in which an Adverse Environmental
Condition shall be remediated, cleaned up or otherwise addressed, in any case
in which such action would affect the manner in which the Business is
conducted or any Facility is operated or used, excluding de minimis affects;
or (c) resolution or settlement of any Third Party Claim if such resolution or
settlement either would affect the manner in which the Business is conducted
or any Facility is operated or used, excluding de minimis affects, or would
increase Buyers exposure to or the likelihood of the assertion of additional
Third Party Claims, provided that Buyer shall not have the right to settle a
claim without Sellers consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement would require Seller to
undertake injunctive or equitable relief or impose a monetary sanction on
Seller either directly or as a result of its indemnification obligations,
including an obligation to pay damages, response costs or civil or criminal
penalties. Nothing herein shall be construed to expand the scope of Sellers
indemnification obligations or negate the principles, terms and limitations
set forth in Section 13.10(b) or otherwise under this Article XIII, and
Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer for Losses to the extent that
the actions or decisions taken by Buyer hereunder cause a significant increase
in Sellers Losses and Liabilities (including, without limitation, any civil
or criminal penalties Seller may incur in connection with any matter subject
to indemnification hereunder). Buyer shall afford Seller, at its own cost and
expense, the opportunity to reasonably participate in any matter that is
subject to this Section 13.10(a), including by providing copies of all
notices, correspondence, draft reports and final reports related to such
matter; providing Seller with a reasonable opportunity to comment on
submissions to Governmental Authorities and other Persons; and allowing
Seller to participate in meetings and discussions with Governmental
Authorities and other Persons.

 

(b) The following principles, terms and limitations shall govern in resolving
any disputes, whether informally or by the mechanisms herein provided:

(i) If the cost of investigation or remediation of actual or alleged
contamination of properties is increased due to actions by Buyer after the
Closing Date, Seller shall not be responsible for any such increase in costs
incurred;

 



-63- (ii) Seller shall only be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Person
for fines or penalties arising out of actual or alleged noncompliance with
Environmental Laws accruing during the period prior to the Closing Date or for
expenditures made or actions taken by any Buyer Indemnified Person to achieve
compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, to the extent the Business was
not in compliance on the Closing Date, and shall in no event be liable for any
Losses arising out of any expenditures made or actions taken by any Buyer
Indemnified Person to maintain compliance with applicable Environmental Laws
based on circumstances arising after the Closing Date; for expenditures that
are not commercially reasonable taking into account the obligation to come
into compliance with applicable Environmental Law or, subject to the express
written consent of Seller, that improve the Purchased Assets or Leased Real
Property in a manner that goes beyond what is required to bring said assets
into compliance with applicable Environmental Law for the purpose
of providing an economic benefit to a Buyer Indemnified Person; or for
operating costs related to the ongoing operation of the Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Leased Real Property once compliance has been
achieved;

 

(iii) Seller shall not be responsible for any Losses, including costs of
investigation and remediation of properties impacted by Hazardous Materials,
to the extent such Losses are incurred due to: (i) any change in Environmental
Laws after the Closing Date; (ii) the closure or partial closure or sale of
the Purchased Assets or Leased Real Property, or any operations or units that
comprise part of the Purchased Assets or Leased Real Property; (iii) any
change in the use of the Purchased Assets or the Leased Real Property after
the Closing Date that would trigger investigation or remediation obligations
or would result in the imposition of more stringent Remediation Standards; or
(iv) any investigation or remediation that is not conducted to achieve
compliance with the least stringent applicable Remediation Standard and in a
cost effective manner. Seller shall not be liable for any operating costs
associated with on-going monitoring and operations and maintenance after
completion of an investigation or remediation of alleged or actual
contamination of soil, groundwater or surface water;

(iv) Seller shall not be responsible for costs for investigation, remediation
corrective actions or other Losses arising out of or related to any
investigation, compliance or risk audit, assessment, study or other remedial
or corrective action that any Buyer Indemnified Person voluntarily initiates,
performs or causes to be performed by any Person or Governmental Authority
(i.e., any investigation, compliance or risk audit, assessment, study or other
remedial or corrective action that any Buyer Indemnified Person initiates,
performs or causes to be performed which is not required by any Environmental
Law or first initiated and required by a Governmental Authority), _provided_ ,
that this limitation shall not apply to compliance audits that are conducted
by Buyer in the normal course of business consistent with Buyers established
environmental, health and safety auditing program; and

(v) Seller shall not be responsible for any Losses arising as a result of any
matter as to which Buyer has initiated contact with a Governmental Authority
without prior approval from Seller, if Seller can demonstrate that Buyer
would, in the normal course of operating its business, not have initiated
such contact with such Governmental Authority and was doing so for the primary
purpose of accelerating or creating a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



-64- 13.11 _Tax Treatment of Payment under Article XIII_. Unless otherwise required
by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, all payments received by an
Indemnified Person from an Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Article XIII
shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Consideration. If
the receipt of any such payment is required by applicable Law to be treated
for income Tax purposes in a manner other than as an adjustment to the
Consideration, the amount of the payment shall be increased to take account of
net Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Person in respect thereto.

13.12 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of (a) willful misconduct with
respect to the breach of a covenant or agreement contained herein or (b)
fraud by a party and as set forth in Sections 3.5 and 3.6 Buyer and Seller
acknowledge and agree that (i) following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of this Article XIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedies for
any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or any breach,
nonfulfillment or default in the performance of any of the covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement and (ii) anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of
Buyer or Seller, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any
nature whatsoever in respect thereof (whether by contract, common law,
statute, law, regulation or otherwise), all of which the parties hereby
waive.

ARTICLE XIV

 

 _DISPUTE RESOLUTION_

 

14.1 _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Sections 3.5 and 3.6, any dispute or difference
occurring or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including,
without limitation, any contested claim for indemnification pursuant to
Article XIII above (each, a " _Dispute_ "), shall be first submitted for
resolution pursuant to the following procedure. First, a senior executive
officer of each party will meet in person to resolve the Dispute within ten
(10) days after written notice of such Dispute is provided to the other party.
If such executive officers are unable to resolve the dispute within
such 10-day period, the Chief Executive Officers of each party shall promptly
attempt to resolve the Dispute. If the Chief Executive Officers are unable to
resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days following the original notice of
such Dispute, such Dispute shall be submitted to non-binding mediation as
provided in this Section 14.1.

(b) Mediation of each dispute shall be facilitated by a single mediator
selected by the parties, knowledgeable and experienced in resolution of
commercial disputes. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on a single
mediator, each of Buyer and Seller shall designate a representative of its
own choosing, and the two persons so designated shall select a third mediator
who shall mediate the Dispute.

 



-65- (c) The mediation shall take place in Tampa, Florida or in such other place
as the parties may agree, within thirty (30) days following the date one or
both of the Chief Executive Officers informs the other that they are unable to
resolve the matter pursuant to this Section 14.1 (the " _Mediation Period_
").

(d) If, for any reason, the parties have not resolved the Dispute in writing
at the expiration of the Mediation Period, then (i) such portion of the
unresolved Dispute which involves a claim for indemnification under Sections
13.2(a)(ii), 13.2(a)(vi), 13.2(a)(vii) (with respect to the Excluded
Obligations described in Section 2.6(g) or (h)), 13.3(a)(iv) (with respect to
the Assumed Obligations described in Section 2.5(c)) or 13.3(a)(v) (with
respect to compliance with or Liability under Environmental Laws or
Environmental Permits or with respect to environmental, health and safety
matters, including protection or preservation of natural resources) (an "
_Environmental Dispute_ ") shall be submitted for final and binding
arbitration in the manner provided by Section 14.2 below; and (ii) all other
remaining unresolved Disputes shall be brought by an action for relief at law
or in equity as provided in Section 15.13 below.

 

14.2 _Arbitration of Environmental Disputes_. As provided in Section 14.1(d)
above, any Environmental Disputes which remain unresolved by the expiration
of the Mediation Period shall be referred to final and binding arbitration
administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its
Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, except as modified herein. There
shall be three arbitrators. Each arbitrator shall be an attorney with
experience in Environmental Laws and resolution of the types of matters that
are the subject of the Environmental Dispute. The claimant(s) shall appoint
one arbitrator in the Demand for Arbitration and the respondent(s) shall
appoint another arbitrator in the Answering Statement. Within thirty (30)
calendar days after the appointment of the second arbitrator, the two party-
appointed arbitrators shall appoint the third arbitrator, who shall serve as
chair of the tribunal. Any arbitrator not timely appointed herein shall, upon
the request of any party, be appointed by the American Arbitration
Association. The legal seat of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware,
although the arbitral tribunal may hold the arbitration hearing in Tampa,
Florida, or any other that location it determines is most convenient. Unless
the parties to the arbitration otherwise mutually agree in writing, or unless
the tribunal, in its discretion, determines otherwise, the tribunal shall
endeavor to render an award within thirty (30) days of the date of the final
post-hearing submission; provided, that the failure to meet any such time
period shall not constitute a grounds against or objection to the
confirmation or enforcement of the arbitration award. The tribunal shall have
the power to grant all legal and equitable remedies available under this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and/or specific
performance, except that incidental, special, consequential, punitive or
exemplary damages shall not be awarded. The award of the tribunal shall be
final and binding on the parties thereto, and may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



-66- 14.3 _Confidentiality_. All proceedings under this Article XIV, and all
evidence given or discovered pursuant hereto, shall be maintained in
confidence by all parties, and may not be disclosed except and to the extent
that disclosure is required by law or regulation, is required to protect or
pursue a legal right or is required to enforce or challenge an arbitral award
in legal proceedings before a court or other competent judicial authority. Any
proceedings under Section 14.1, and any information disclosed or settlement
discussions conducted shall be treated as subject to Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and shall not be admissible in any action relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement or the formation of this Agreement.

 

14.4 _Continued Performance_. The fact that the dispute resolution procedure
specified in this Article XIV shall have been or may be invoked shall not
excuse any party from performing its obligations under this Agreement and,
during the pendency of any such procedure, all parties shall continue to
perform their respective obligations in good faith, subject to any rights
to terminate this Agreement that may be available to any party.

ARTICLE XV

later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or of
any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or
more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any

-68- 15.6 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither this Agreement, nor any
Ancillary Agreements (except as may be expressly provided otherwise in any
such Ancillary Agreement) nor any right or obligation hereunder or thereunder
may be assigned by any party hereto other than to an Affiliate of such party
without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that no such assignment shall relieve a party from its obligations under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in
this Agreement is intended to limit Buyers ability to sell or to transfer any
or all of the Purchased Assets following the Closing; _provided_ , _further_
, _however_ , that in connection with any such sale or transfer, Buyer may not
sell, assign or transfer any rights against Seller or any of its Affiliates
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement without the prior written
consent of Seller. Buyer may designate one or more Affiliates to take title to
certain of the Purchased Assets, but no such designation shall relieve Buyer
from any obligation under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

15.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
Article XIII with respect to Indemnified Persons, this Agreement is solely
for the benefit of the parties hereto and no provision of this Agreement shall
be deemed to confer upon any other Person any remedy, claim, Liability,
reimbursement, cause of action or other right, including without limitation,
rights of any Affected Employee in respect of any right of any party hereunder
or any right to contract or any right to employment or continued employment
with Buyer.

 

15.8 _Publicity_. Prior to the Closing, neither party to this Agreement shall
make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written consent
of the other party unless otherwise required by Law or applicable
stock exchange regulation, and the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
as to the timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement
or communication.

 

15.9 _Further Assurances_. Seller and Buyer agree to execute and deliver such
other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such
other actions as may be reasonable, necessary or desirable in order to
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any agreement, document or instrument contemplated herein.

 

15.10 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability
of the other provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby, and there shall
be deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and
enforceable provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.

 

15.11 _Entire Understanding_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements set
forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede any
and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings among such parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



-69- 15.12 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws
of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts
of law thereof.

 

15.13 _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Subject to Article XIV and Sections 3.5 and 3.6 herein, Buyer and Seller
each irrevocably agrees that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
and, in the event such court does not have jurisdiction over the Dispute, any
state or U.S. federal court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of
Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ "), and appropriate appellate courts
therefrom, are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any claims,
differences or disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

(b) Buyer and Seller each irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts for such purpose and waives any objection
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any proceedings in
any Delaware Court and any claim that any proceedings brought in any such
court have been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of Buyer and Seller
further irrevocably agrees that a final judgment in any proceedings brought in
an applicable Delaware Court shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto and may be enforced in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 15.13(c).

15.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same original instrument.

 



-70- 15.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto recognize that, if Seller or
Buyer refuses to perform under the provisions of this Agreement, monetary
damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Buyer or Seller for its
injuries. Buyer or Seller shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any
other remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of the
terms of this Agreement. If any action is brought by Buyer or Seller to
enforce this Agreement, Buyer or Seller shall waive the defense that there is
an adequate remedy at law. In the event of a default by Buyer or Seller that
results in the filing of a lawsuit for damages, specific performance or other
remedies, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the other
party of reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, in connection with such lawsuit.

15.16 _Guarantee_.

 

(a) To induce Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Parent, subject to the terms
and conditions below, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to Buyer when due, after any required notice has been given and
after any applicable cure periods have expired, complete and punctual payment,
observance, performance and discharge of the obligations of Seller under this
Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). This is an unconditional
guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection. The parties hereto
recognize that, if Parent refuses to perform under the provisions of this
Section 15.16, monetary damages alone will not be adequate to compensate Buyer
for its injuries. Buyer shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other
remedies that may be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms
of this Section 15.16. If any action is brought by Buyer to enforce this
Section 15.16, Parent shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy
at law. In the event of a default by Parent under this Section 15.16 that
results in the filing of a lawsuit for damages, specific performance or other
remedies, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the other
party of reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by Buyer or Parent, as
applicable, in connection with such lawsuit.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon the
failure by Seller to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement,
Buyer shall provide Parent with a copy of any notice(s) of default provided to
Seller under this Agreement or which Buyer is entitled to provide to Seller
under this Agreement, and Buyer shall make demand of payment and/or
performance upon Parent. Such demand shall be in writing and shall state the
obligation that Seller has failed to perform under this Agreement. Subject to
any limitations set forth herein, Parent shall pay and/or perform, or cause
to be paid and/or performed, such Guaranteed Obligations within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of such demand. A single written demand shall be
effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such
default, until Seller or Parent has cured such default, and additional
written demands concerning such default shall not be required until such
default is cured.

 

(c) Parent reserves to itself all rights, counterclaims and other defenses
which Seller may have to payment of any Guaranteed Obligation, except for
defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation, receivership or similar proceeding affecting Seller. Parent
waives all rights of subrogation to or contribution by Seller until the
Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Parent shall have and may assert
against

 



-71-  its obligations hereunder, and Parents obligations hereunder shall be
subject to, any claim, right, deduction or defense of any kind that Seller may
have under this Agreement, (ii) to the extent this Agreement provides for
notices, limitations, restrictions or other procedures or provisions, such
notices, limitations, restrictions and other procedures and provisions shall
apply to Parents obligations hereunder to the same extent as they apply to
Seller under this Agreement and (iii) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that
neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights or remedies under
this Agreement as to Parent that they would not otherwise have as to Seller
under this Agreement, (A) except as otherwise provided in Section 7.1 and (B)
except for the guaranty provided in this Section 15.16 subject to all of the
other provisions of this Section 15.16.
