Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant to the DGCL by
filing a certificate of merger in customary form and substance (the
"Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such
filing and acceptance for record by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger, being referred
to herein as the "Effective Time").

 

 _2.3 The Closing_. The consummation of the Merger will take place at a

set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions); or (b) such
other time, location and date as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company mutually
agree in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth
in _Article_ __ _ VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing), then the Closing will occur on the earlier

than on three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Company; and (ii)
the second Business Day after the expiration of the Marketing Period. The
date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing

_2.4 Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
will be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all (a) of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving
Corporation; and (b) debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

_2.5_ _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as set forth in _ Exhibit A_ attached hereto and, as so amended and
restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL and
such certificate of incorporation (subject to _ Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_).

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, except that all references to Merger Sub shall be
automatically amended and shall become references to the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided by the DGCL, the
certificate of incorporation and such bylaws (subject to _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)_).

 



-19- 

    

_2.6_ _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving
Corporation will be the officers of the Company as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Organizational
Documents of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are
duly appointed.

 

 _2.7_ _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any of the securities described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, the following
will occur:

 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that
is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be cancelled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and
thereupon each certificate representing ownership of such shares of
common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or
Dissenting Company Shares) will be automatically cancelled, extinguished and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $17.75,
without interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.11_); and

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned Company
Shares") will automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any Company Common Stock described in clause (C) of the foregoing that
is owned by a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company will
be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation that represents the same relative economic ownership as such
Company Common Stock represented prior to the Merger.

 



-20- 

    

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
similar change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required thereby), any shares of
the Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than the Owned Company Shares) and that are held by
any holder of such Company Common Stock who has not voted in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with,
and who has complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any such
Company Common Stock held by any such holder (the "Dissenting Company
Shares") will not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Price
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, and holders of such Dissenting Company
Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Company Shares will thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Per Share Price and the Surviving Corporation shall
remain liable for payment of the Per Share Price for such Dissenting Company
Shares in accordance with this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder
of Dissenting Company Shares will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided
in the previous sentence.

 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of any such demand, and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any written demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any
such demands, waive any failure to comply with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

_2.8 Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the
Per Share Price (less the exercise price per share attributable to such

 



-21- 

    

 Company Option); multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full of such Company Option (the
"Option Consideration");  _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each
Company Option granted on or after December 7, 2018 (each such Company Option,
a "Cash Rollover Company Option"), the Option Consideration will, subject to
the holders continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting
dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the Cash Rollover Company
Option for which such Option Consideration was exchanged would have vested
pursuant to its terms (the Option Consideration payable to holders of Cash
Rollover Company Options, the "Cash Replacement Option Amounts"). All Cash
Replacement Option Amounts will have the same terms and conditions
(including, with respect to vesting (including accelerated vesting on specific
terminations of employment, to the extent applicable)) as applied to the award
of Cash Rollover Company Options for which they were exchanged, except for
terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with
respect to Company Options for which the exercise price per
share attributable to such Company Options is equal to or greater than the
Per Share Price, such Company Options will be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof.

 

(b) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time each Company RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the amount of the
Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU (the "RSU Consideration"); _provided_
, that 50% of the RSU Consideration shall be payable on the Closing Date and
the remaining 50% of the RSU Consideration (the "Pre 2018 RSU Cash Amount")
shall vest and be payable in accordance with the terms of such Company RSU for
which such Pre 2018 RSU Cash Amount was exchanged, subject to the holders
continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting dates (or, if
earlier than the applicable vesting dates, with one-half of the remaining 50%
vesting and payable on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and the
remaining portion vesting and payable on the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, subject to such continued service). For each Company RSU granted on or
after December 7, 2018 (each such Company RSU, a "Cash Rollover Company RSU"),
the RSU Consideration (the RSU Consideration payable to holders of Cash
Rollover Company RSUs, the "Cash Replacement RSU Amounts") will, subject to
the holders continued service with Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through the applicable vesting
dates, vest and be payable in accordance with the terms of such Cash Rollover
Company RSU for which such Cash Replacement RSU Amount was exchanged, provided
that no less than 50% of each applicable Company RSU holders Cash Replacement
RSU Amount shall vest and be payable on the first anniversary of the Closing
Date and any unvested portion of the applicable Company RSU holders Cash
Replacement RSU Amount shall vest and be payable on the second anniversary of
the Closing Date. Except as set forth in this Section with respect to
specific vesting dates, all Cash Replacement RSU Amounts and Pre 2018 RSU Cash
Amounts will have the same terms and conditions (including, with respect to
vesting (including accelerated vesting on specific terminations of
employment, to the extent applicable)) as applied to the award of Cash
Rollover Company RSUs or Company RSUs, as applicable, for which they were
exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-22- 

    

(c) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time (i) each Other Company PSU
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled for no consideration and (ii) each
Specified Company PSU granted on December 8, 2017 or March 9, 2018
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and will
become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (x)
the amount of the Per Share Price; multiplied by (y) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Specified Company PSU,
with any performance-based vesting conditions deemed achieved based on actual
performance during the applicable performance period, which shall be shortened
to end on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date (the
"PSU Consideration"); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each
Specified Company PSU granted on or after December 7, 2018 (each such
Specified Company PSU, a "Cash Rollover Specified Company PSU"), the
PSU Consideration shall equal (i) the Per Share Price; multiplied by (ii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Specified
Company PSU, with any performance-based vesting conditions deemed achieved at
target, and such PSU Consideration (the PSU Consideration payable to holders
of Cash Rollover Specified Company PSUs, the "Cash Replacement PSU Amounts")
will, subject to the holders continued service with Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) through
the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable in accordance with the terms
of such Cash Rollover Specified Company PSU for which such Cash Replacement
PSU Amount was exchanged, provided that no less than 50% of each applicable
Cash Rollover Specified Company PSU holders Cash Replacement PSU Amount shall
vest and be payable on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and any
unvested portion of the applicable Cash Rollover Specified Company PSU
holders Cash Replacement PSU Amount shall vest and be payable on the second
anniversary of the Closing Date . Except as set forth in this Section with
respect to specific vesting dates, all Cash Replacement PSU Amounts will have
the same terms and conditions (including, with respect to vesting (including
accelerated vesting on specific terminations of employment, to the extent
applicable)) as applied to the award of Cash Rollover Company Specified
Company PSUs for which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered
inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the aggregate (i) Option Consideration owed to
all holders of Company Options that are not Cash Rollover Company Options
(such Company Options, "Cashout Company Options"); (ii) RSU Consideration
(other than Pre 2018 RSU Cash Amounts) owed to all holders of Company RSUs
that are not Cash Rollover Company RSUs (such Company RSUs, "Cashout Company
RSUs"); and (iii) PSU Consideration owed to all holders of Specified Company
PSUs that are not Cash Rollover Specified Company PSUs (such Specified Company
PSUs, "Cashout Specified Company PSUs"). As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date but in any event no later than the later of (x) three (3)
Business Days following the Closing Date and (y) the first regularly scheduled
payroll date following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of Cashout
Company Options, Cashout Company RSUs and Cashout Specified Company PSUs

 



-23- 

    

 (collectively, "Cashout Company Equity Awards") will receive a payment from
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or
payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such holders in
respect of such Cashout Company Equity Awards that are cancelled and converted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_ and  _Section_
__ _ 2.8(c)_ as applicable; _provided_ , that if any payment owed to a holder
of Cashout Company Equity Awards pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_ __ as applicable, cannot
be made through the Companys or the Surviving Corporations payroll system or
payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will (i) by wire transfer or
direct deposit, or (ii) by a check sent by overnight courier to such holder
promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event later than the later of
(x) three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date and (y) the first
regularly scheduled payroll date following the Closing Date) provide such
payment owed to such holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any
such amounts relate to a Company RSU or Specified Company PSU that is
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to
such Company RSU or Specified Company PSU that will not trigger a tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(e) _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary to effect
the cancellation of the Company Equity Awards upon the Effective Time and to
give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (including the satisfaction of the
requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). If and as
required by Parent or Merger Sub, the Company will take all action necessary
to terminate all Company Stock Plans prior to or as of the Effective Time. 

_2.9_ _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) select a
nationally recognized bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent"); and
(ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent. 

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which such holders of shares of Company Common
Stock become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Until disbursed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash shall be
invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) (such
cash and any proceeds thereon, the "Payment Fund"). To the extent that (A)
there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Payment Fund; (B)
the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _Section_ __ _
2.7_; or (C) all or any portion of the Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent
(or the 

 



-24- 

    

 Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ for any reason, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of
cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any
income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs. The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than the payment to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days), Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares) of
one or more certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates" (if any)) (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share
Price payable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates by (y) the Per Share Price, and the
Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no record holder of uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares)
(the "Uncertificated Shares") will be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the
payment that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.7_ with respect of such Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, such record
holder, upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request), will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders transferred
Uncertificated Shares by (2) the Per Share Price, and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on
the Per Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and
transfer of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(c)_.
Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the Effective Time to
evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Payment Agent shall transmit
to DTC or its nominee following the Effective Time on the Closing Date or as
promptly as practicable thereafter an amount in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, equal to (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares)
held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Price.

 



-25- 

    

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If payment of the Per Share Price is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
or transferred Uncertificated Share in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Person requesting such exchange
present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share
Price to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Payment Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent (or the Surviving Corporation as directed by
Parent), together with any interest or other income received with respect to
the Payment Fund, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who have
not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall thereafter look for
payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely
to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of any such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares five
(5) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors,
assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

_2.10_ _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist;
and (b) each holder of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable
therefor in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, or in the case of
Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_. The
Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _

 registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately

discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share
Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as it may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

 _2.12 Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company

paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Commitment Letter (any such letter, a "Fee Letter"). The Equity Commitment

arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties
thereto; and (iii) to the knowledge of Parent, the respective commitments
contained therein have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no other Contracts,
agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount
of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters
and any Fee Letters.

 

(c) _Sufficiency of Financing_. Assuming the Financing is funded and/or
invested in accordance with the Financing Letters, the Financing is
sufficient to (i) make all payments contemplated by this Agreement in

pursuant to _Article_ __ _ II_ in connection with or as a result of the
Merger); (ii) repay, prepay or discharge (after giving effect to the Merger)
the principal of and interest on, and all other Indebtedness outstanding
pursuant to, the Credit Agreement; and (iii) pay all fees and expenses
required to be paid at the Closing by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the Merger and the Financing (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the
"Financing Uses").

 

(d) _Validity_. As of the date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters (in
the forms delivered by Parent to the Company) are in full force and effect
and constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (including, with respect to the
Equity Commitment Letter, Guarantor), as applicable, enforceable
against Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, as
applicable, in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability (i)
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights
generally; and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity. Other than as

Affiliates is a party. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would, or
would reasonably be expected to, constitute a default or breach on the part of
Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties
thereto pursuant to the Financing Letters. As of the date of this Agreement,
assuming the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2_ have been satisfied, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing to
be satisfied by it in the Financing Letters. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all commitment or other
fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letters.

of their respective Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or
understanding prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank or

financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and then only
to permit such Person to make confidential proposals to the Company. The
Company acknowledges that any violation of the restrictions in this _Section_
__ _ 5.3(a)_ by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or by any Representatives
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Representative
is so authorized and whether or not such Representative is purporting to act

faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal

tender or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal or fail to
recommend against such a tender or exchange offer within ten (10) Business

Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication); provided that the Company expressly confirms that the Company
Board has not changed the Company Board Recommendation in such communication,

itself, that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or the
taking of any other action permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_; or (3) the
delivery by the Company of any notice contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 

(d) _Company_ _Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition

(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) shall not effect
such a Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

 



-58- 

    

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5)
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, which notice
shall specify the basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change,
including a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances
relating to such Intervening Event;

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, during such
five (5) Business Day period, the Company has negotiated with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent requested to do so)
to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that would obviate the
need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such
Intervening Event; and

 

(3) following such time period referred to in clause (2) above, the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account
any modifications to this Agreement and the Financing Letters proposed by
Parent) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; or

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
was not the result of a breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ that the Company
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal; and/or (B) cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_ to
enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal substantially concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) shall not take any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) or
(B) unless:

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

 

(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ with respect to such Superior Proposal;
and

(3) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent five (5) Business
Days in advance (the "Notice Period") to the effect that the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) (A) has received a Superior Proposal; and (B) intends
to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(ii)_ absent any revision to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, which notice will identify the Person or
Group making such Superior Proposal and include the material terms thereof and
copies of all material relevant agreements relating to such Superior Proposal
(it being understood that any revision or amendment to the financial or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new
Superior Proposal and shall require a new written notice and Notice Period);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such new Notice Period shall be three (3)
Business Days;

 



-59- 

    

(4) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent and
its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent has requested to
do so) to allow Parent to offer such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that would
obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change; and

(5) following the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account any modifications
to this Agreement and the Financing Letters proposed by Parent) that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

(e)  _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and the
Effective Time, the Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and,
in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal (or
inquiries, offers or proposals, or any other effort or attempt, that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal) are received by,
any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any
of its Representatives. Such notice must include (i) the identity of the
Person or Group of Persons making such inquiries, offers or proposals; (ii) a
summary of the material terms and conditions of such inquiries, offers or
proposals; and (iii) copies of any such offers or proposals and drafts of
proposed letters of intent, memoranda of understanding, merger agreements,
acquisition agreements or other Contracts related thereto provided to the
Company or any of its Representatives. Thereafter, the Company must keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any
such inquiries, offers or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations, including copies of any
revised offers or proposals and copies of revised drafts of any letters of
intent, memoranda of understanding, merger agreements, acquisition agreements
or other Contracts related thereto provided to the Company or any of its
Representatives.

 

(f) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will prohibit
the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) complying
with the Companys disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) making any disclosure to the
Company Stockholders (including regarding the business, financial condition
or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board (or any committee thereof), after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable

 



-60- 

    

 Law or violate any disclosure requirements under U.S. federal or state Law;
_provided_ that, in each case of (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the Company
expressly confirms that the Company Board has not changed the Company Board
Recommendation in such communication or disclosure and does not include any
statement that itself would be a Company Board Recommendation Change.

and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended
to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or

consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over their own business and operations.

(and shall cause its respective Affiliates), on the one hand, and the Company

Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, then such Party will make (or cause
to be made), as promptly as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other Parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such
request.

 

(b) _Antitrust Approvals_. If and to the extent advisable and necessary to
obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, or to obtain
any consents or approvals pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws, and in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Termination

with respect to the Merger, including (i) promptly notify the Parties of, and,
if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any material
communication received by such Person from a Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger and permit the other parties to review and discuss
in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the other
parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal
notifications, filing, submission or other material written communication (and
any analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other
documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Merger to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the Parties reasonably informed with respect
to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental

and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to
attend or participate. Parent and Merger Sub will not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, extend or offer or agree to extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Authority related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting
periods, including under the HSR Act. However, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as
restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such information shall not be
shared with employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the other
Party without approval of the Party providing the non-public information; 
_provided_ , __ that each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may redact
such information as necessary to (i) remove any valuation and related
information, or (ii) address any contractual arrangements or
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns
before sharing any information provided to any Governmental Authority with
another Party on an "outside counsel" only basis.

 

(d) _Other Actions_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, between the
date hereof and the Closing, it shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates (disregarding for this purpose the proviso in the definition
thereof), if applicable, to, acquire or agree to acquire (by stock purchase,
merger, consolidation, purchase of assets, license or otherwise) any
ownership interest, assets or rights of any Person if such acquisition would
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining, or to
result in any material delay in obtaining, the termination or expiration of
the waiting period pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Merger, or would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent
or delay the Merger in any material respect.

 

 _6.3 Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as practical following the date of this
Agreement (and in any event by January 23, 2019), the Company (with the
assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably requested by
the Company) shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement
(as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"), then the Company
(with the assistance and cooperation of Parent and Merger Sub as reasonably
requested by the Company) shall promptly prepare and file such Other Required
Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules

 



-64- 

    

 of the SEC and NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company Filing (including any amendments to any such filings,
but excluding amendments that may be deemed made by incorporation by
reference through filings by the Company unrelated to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby) with the SEC without providing Parent
and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon,
and the Company shall give good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent and its counsel.

(c) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall furnish all information
concerning it and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC
of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing. The Company
shall ensure that the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing
will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and
at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with
respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement. If at
any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should
be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on
the other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case may be, so
that such filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement to such filing describing such information shall be promptly
prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate Party and, to the extent
required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the
Company Stockholders.

(d) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company, on the one
hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing (including with
respect to any of the matters described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)(ii)_ below), as the case may be, without providing the
other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written
communication, and such Party shall give good faith consideration to any
comments made by the other Party and its counsel.

(e) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any

staff on the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing, as the case

shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that

Statement (or as promptly as reasonably practicable following the tenth (10th)
calendar day immediately following the date of filing of the preliminary
Proxy Statement with the SEC if the Company is not contacted by the SEC during
such 10-day period).

_6.4 Company Stockholder Meeting_.

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, and in consultation with Parent, the Company will take all action
necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Companys Organizational Documents
and the rules and regulations of the NYSE to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
"Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose
of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval. The Company and Parent agree
to cooperate in good faith to establish a timeline for holding the Company
Stockholder Meeting as expeditiously as reasonably possible after the date of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall cause
the adoption of the Merger Agreement to be submitted to a vote of its
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting notwithstanding any Company
Board Recommendation Change, unless such Company Board Recommendation Change
is with respect to a Superior Proposal and this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_.

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. The Company shall not
change the date of, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting
without the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from postponing
or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting, and the Company shall postpone
or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if requested by Parent, in either
case, (i) to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain
the Requisite Stockholder Approval; (ii) if there are insufficient shares of
the Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company
Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting;
or (iii) the Company reasonably determines (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff,
including to the extent that such postponement or adjournment of the Company
Stockholder Meeting is required by applicable Law or the SEC or its staff in
order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any
information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company
Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders
(including in connection with any Company Board Recommendation Change);
_provided_ that, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), and unless
there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit such additional proxies (or the
presence in person of the Company Stockholders) as expeditiously as 

 



-66- 

    

 reasonably possible; and _provided_ _further_ that, in the case of each of
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), the Company shall consult with Parent
prior to making such adjournment or postponement and shall make such
adjournment or postponement for the minimum amount of time that may be
reasonably required, as determined by the Company in good faith after
consultation with Parent.

 

 _6.5_ _Financing_.

(a)  _No Amendments to Debt Commitment Letter_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent will not permit any early termination,
amendment or modification or replacement to be made to or of, or any waiver or
replacement of any provision or remedy pursuant to or of, the Debt Commitment
Letter if such amendment, modification or replacement or waiver would, or
would reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate committed amount of
the Debt Financing, to be available on the Closing to satisfy the Financing
Uses, unless the Equity Financing is increased by an equivalent amount; (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or any other
terms to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A)
delay or prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing, less likely to occur in any respect; or (iii) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other
Parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or, if applicable, the definitive
agreements with respect thereto. Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the
"Financing" will include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as amended, modified, waived or replaced to the extent
permitted hereunder; and (2) "Equity Commitment Letter," "Debt Commitment
Letter" or "Financing Letters" will include such documents as amended,
modified, waived or replaced to the extent permitted hereunder.

 

(b) _Taking of Necessary Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain at
Closing the Financing on the terms and conditions (including to the extent
required, the full valid exercise of any flex provisions) described in the
Financing Letters and any related Fee Letter or on such other terms that are
not prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Letters in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii)
negotiate, and on the Closing Date, execute and deliver definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter and related Fee Letter or other terms which are not
prohibited by  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_; (iii) taking into account the timing
of the Marketing Period and the requirements of _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, satisfy
on a timely basis all conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent in
the Debt Commitment Letter and in the Equity Commitment Letter; (iv)
consummate the Financing at the Closing, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing at the
Closing assuming the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _
7.2_ have been satisfied (except those that by their nature can only be
satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date); and (v) comply with its
obligations in all material respects pursuant to the Financing Letters.
Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all
commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Financing Letters as and when
they become due assuming the conditions in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied (except those that by their nature
can only be satisfied after giving effect to the Effective Time or the receipt
of proceeds from the funding of the Debt Financing).

 



-67- 

    

(c) _Information_. To the extent reasonably requested from time to time by the
Company, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub must give the Company prompt notice (A) of any material breach (or
written threatened breach) or material default (or any event or circumstance
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach or material default) by any party to the
Financing Letters or, if applicable, definitive agreements related to the
Financing; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or
written communication from any Financing Source with respect to any (1)
actual or threatened material breach, material default, early termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or, if applicable, any
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Letters or, if applicable, such definitive agreements; or (2)
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Letters
or any definitive agreements related to the Financing (but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiation with respect to the terms
of the Debt Financing or Alternate Debt Financing); and (C) if for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub at any time reasonably believes that it will not be able
to obtain at or prior to Closing all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters
or, if applicable, any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent
must provide any information in its possession reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous
sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event with two (2)
Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written request
therefor to Parent; _provided_ that, in no event shall Parent be under any
obligation to deliver or disclose any information that could reasonably be
expected to waive the protection of attorney-client protection or similar
privilege. 

(d) _Alternate Debt Financing_. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, Parent will use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, to (i) obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources on conditions not less favorable in any respect to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and
the related Fee Letter in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of
the Financing that is available, to pay all Financing Uses (the "Alternate
Debt Financing"); and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters
with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the "New Debt
Commitment Letters"), which new letters will replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of
any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith,
which may be redacted so long as no redaction covers terms that would
adversely affect the aggregate principal amount committed under the Debt
Commitment Letters, conditionality, availability or termination of the
Alternate Debt Financing) to the Company. In the event that any New Debt
Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment 

 



-68- 

    

 Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_
shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be
deemed or construed to require, Parent to (x) pay any fees or agree to pay any
interest rate amounts, in either case, in excess of those contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof (taking into account
any "market flex" provisions contained therein) or to consummate the Debt
Financing prior to the date as is required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_
(taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period) or (y) seek or
obtain equity financing in excess of the amount provided for in, or form a
Person other than the counterparties to, the Equity Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof.

 

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing, but without
limiting the Companys obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.6_. If the
Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to
be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_, to consummate the Merger.

_6.6 Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause
each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors,
managers, and employees to use their respective reasonable best efforts and
shall use reasonable best efforts to direct its and its Subsidiaries
respective accountants, advisors and other Representatives to, provide Parent
with all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent to assist it in causing
the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters to be satisfied or as is
otherwise reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing, including:

of management to participate in, a reasonable number of meetings,

material non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (2) customary authorization and representation letters
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter), customary pro forma
financial statements as required under clause 6 of Exhibit D of the Debt
Commitment Letter (which shall be limited to assisting in the preparation of
(but not preparing) such pro forma financial statements), and other customary
marketing materials reasonably required in connection with the Debt
Financing;

 



-69- 

    

(iii) assisting Parent in connection with the preparation of, and executing
and delivering, any pledge, security and other definitive financing documents

with respect to solvency matters substantially in the form attached to the
Debt Commitment Letter), as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Debt
Financing Sources, in connection with the Debt Financing and to facilitate
the pledging and perfection of security interests in the collateral);
_provided_ that (A) none of the documents or certificates (other than the
authorization and representation letters referred to above) shall be required

connection with the Closing and (B) the effectiveness thereof shall be
conditioned upon, or become operative upon, the occurrence of the Closing;

and its Subsidiaries customarily required in connection with the Debt
Financing regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested to
be used in connection with the Debt Financing;

 

(v) provide drafts of the payoff letters and giving (by the date required
under the agreements governing such Indebtedness) any necessary notices
(including notices of prepayment), to allow for the prepayment, payoff,
discharge and termination in full at the Closing of all Indebtedness required
by this Agreement to be repaid on the Closing Date; and

 

(vi) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, provide
Parent all documentation and other information with respect to the Closing
and its Subsidiaries as shall have been reasonably requested at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and that is required in connection
with the Debt Financing by regulatory authorities under applicable "know-
your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
PATRIOT Act and including, if the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
qualify as "legal entity customers" under the Beneficial
Ownership Regulation, a Beneficial Ownership Certificate (each as defined in
the Debt Commitment Letter).

require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms
of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to
the Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement; (ii)
enter into any definitive agreement that is not contingent upon the Closing;
(iii) give any indemnities that are effective prior to the Effective Time;
(iv) take any action that, in the good faith determination of the Company,
would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business or the Company
and its Subsidiaries; (v) take any action that could reasonably be expected to
result in a contravention of, violation or breach of, or default under, the
Agreement, any Organizational Document, material Contract or any applicable
Law; or (vi) provide access to or disclose information which would result in

obligation (not entered into in contemplation of this Agreement) in any
Material Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall inform
Parent of the general nature of the information being withheld. In
addition, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers or

 



-70-

not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time, the directors and managers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be required to adopt resolutions approving the
agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is
obtained unless Parent shall have determined that such directors and managers
are to remain as directors and managers of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on and after the Effective Time and such resolutions are contingent upon the
occurrence of, or only effective as of, the Effective Time and any bank
information memoranda and high yield offering prospectuses or memoranda
required in relation to the Debt Financing will contain disclosure and
financial statements reflecting the Surviving Corporation as the obligor.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ will require (1) any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion
or take any other action under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ that could reasonably
be expected to result in personal liability to such Representative; or (2)
the Company Board to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be deemed to have complied with  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ for
all purposes of this Agreement (including _Article_ __ _ V_, _Article_ __ _
VI_ and _Article_ __ _ VII_) unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained
primarily as a result of the Companys Willful and Material Breach of its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_. The Parties hereto acknowledge that

Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective officers, directors,

connection with the Financing and no other provision of the
Agreement (including exhibits and schedules) shall be deemed to expand or
modify such obligations.

(c) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in a form and manner reasonably acceptable to the Company
in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended or likely to, and will not, harm or disparage
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all goodwill arising from the use
thereof shall inure to the Company.

 

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources
and other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties

case, to their respective counsel and auditors), subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will
reimburse the Company for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their

and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection
with their cooperation in arranging the Financing pursuant to this Agreement
or the provision of information utilized in connection therewith, other than
to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, one of its
Subsidiaries or such other related parties as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable order. Parents
obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ and this _Section_ __ _

Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will be
deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the
financing sources or potential financing sources of Parent, Merger Sub and

any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing from providing or seeking to provide debt or equity financing or
financial advisory services to any Person, in each case in connection with
a transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in
connection with the Merger.

all actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Voting Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all
action within their power to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to

applicable Law, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance request
provided in writing to the General Counsel of the Company, or another Person
designated in writing by the Company, to the properties, books and records and

Representatives (including its Financing Sources), all other
information, agreements and documents concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent and its Representatives (including its Financing Sources)
may reasonably request in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any Contract in
effect as of the date hereof or applicable Law requires the Company to
restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b)
access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of
waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
privilege applicable to such documents or information; (c) access to a

disclosure of any trade secrets of third Persons; _provided_ that the Parties
shall collaborate in good faith to make alternative arrangements to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set
forth in clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) above. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
6.8_ shall be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses,
appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall be
conducted in a manner that (i) does not unreasonably interfere or otherwise
result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
officers, employees and other authorized Representatives of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries of their normal duties, or (ii) create a risk of damage
or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be
subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and will not include
the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or
any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

_6.9 Section_ __ _ 16(b) Exemption_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or

the Company, to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

_6.10 Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, honor and fulfill the obligations of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any written indemnification agreements that have been
made available to Parent between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors or
officers, on the other hand (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons"). In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least
as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-
year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any adverse manner except as required by applicable Law.

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. __ Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted

 



-73- 

    

 by applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement,
which have been made available to Parent, each Indemnified Person from and
against any reasonable costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, penalties, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises out of (i) the fact that an Indemnified Person is or was a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate, or (ii) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, including in connection with the Merger or taken at the request
of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary or Affiliate as a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person
(including any employee benefit plan), regardless of whether such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, except that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, the Surviving Corporation
shall advance all reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and
expenses of any counsel, which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of
such Legal Proceeding. Such advancement shall be subject to a written
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to promptly repay all such advances in
the event that it is finally determined that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates shall settle
or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
a full release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of
such Legal Proceeding. Any determination made with respect to whether the
conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable
standard for indemnification will be made by independent legal counsel
selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably
acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which shall
be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; _ provided_, _ however_, that in satisfying its obligation
under this _ Section_ __ _ 6.11(c)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the
date hereof (the "Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed 300% of the amount paid by the Company for the DandO
Insurance for its last full policy period, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. For a period of one (1) year following
the Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), the Surviving Corporation and

benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit or compensation
plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than

such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents to the same extents such requirements were waived or
satisfied under the comparable Old Plan, and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date that such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New

covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan
with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee. Any

Employee following the Effective Time, and will not be subject to accrual
limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals.

to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section_

Transaction, then the Company shall substantially concurrently upon the
earlier of the entry into such definitive agreement or such consummation, as
the case may be, pay the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_, all references to
"15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be
references to "45%".

 

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(f)_, then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) following such termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
(or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent if
one has been so designated by Parent.

(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.1(h)_, then the Company must substantially concurrently with such
termination pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or its designee) the Company
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated in writing by Parent if one has been so designated by
Parent.

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_, then Parent
must promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such
termination pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Parent Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Company.

 

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
will the Company or Parent be required to pay the Company Termination Fee or
the Parent Termination Fee, respectively, on more than one occasion, whether
or not the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events.

 



-84- 

    

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Merger, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof or a judgment against
Parent for the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ or any portion
thereof, as applicable, the Company shall pay to Parent or Parent shall pay to
the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together
with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment
or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment
or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law (the amounts referred to in the foregoing,
the "Collection Costs").

(f) _Sole Remedy_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement but
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(g)_ and the last sentence of this _Section_
__ _ 8.3(f)(i)_, if Parent or Merger Sub fails to effect the Closing or
otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder (in any
case, whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or by Willful and
Material Breach or otherwise) when required to do so, then, except for (x) the
Companys rights under _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ to require Parent and Merger Sub
to specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement (solely to the
extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 9.8_), (y) the Companys rights under the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Guarantee solely to the extent provided
therein, and (z) the Companys rights under _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_ with respect to any Reimbursement Obligations and
under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ with respect to any Collection Costs, the
Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against Parent, Merger Sub or any of the other Parent
Related Parties in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_ and receive payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, any Reimbursement Obligations and any Collection
Costs (in each case from Parent or from the Guarantor pursuant to the
Guarantee solely to the extent provided therein) to the extent payable
hereunder, and upon payment of such amounts by Parent (or by the
Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee solely to the extent provided therein),
Parent and Merger Sub shall have no further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection
herewith (including the Financing Letters) or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Except with respect to the Companys rights
under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_, _Section_ __ _
6.6(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_ to receive the Parent Termination Fee,
any Reimbursement Obligations and any Collection Costs and as expressly set
forth in the Guarantee to seek payment of the Parent Termination Fee, any
Reimbursement Obligations and any Collection Costs from the Guarantor,
following a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1_, the Company shall thereafter not be entitled to bring and shall in no
event support, facilitate, encourage or take any Legal Proceeding other than
opposing the bringing of any Legal Proceeding (under any legal theory, whether
sounding in law (whether for breach of contract, in tort or otherwise) or in
equity) against Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor or any of the other Parent

 



-85- 

    

 Related Parties with respect to, arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the failure of the Closing to occur or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder, under the Financing Letters or otherwise (in any case,
whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or by Willful and Material
Breach or otherwise), and the Company shall cause any such Legal Proceeding
pending as of any termination of this Agreement to be dismissed
with prejudice as promptly as practicable after such termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, other than the right to receive payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, any Reimbursement Obligations and any Collection Costs in the event
required hereunder, under no circumstances will the Company or any other
Company Related Party be entitled to any monetary damages or other monetary
remedies for any losses, damages or liabilities suffered as a result of the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (in any case, whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or by Willful and Material Breach
or otherwise) or for any representation made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith, and Parents, Merger Subs and the other Parent Related
Parties maximum aggregate liability in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall not in any case exceed an amount
equal to the Parent Termination Fee, any Reimbursement Obligations and any
Collection Costs (the "Parent Liability Cap"). The term "Parent
Related Parties" shall include Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the
Financing Sources, any direct or indirect holder of any equity interests or
securities of Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Financing Sources or any
direct or indirect current, former or future director, officer, employee,
partner, stockholder, manager, Affiliate (including for purposes of this
definition, portfolio companies of investment funds), member, controlling
person or representative of any of the foregoing. The Parent Related Parties
are express third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_ and may
enforce the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_ against the Parties to
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect the rights and obligations of the parties signatory to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1
_under circumstances in which the Company is required to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, Parents (or its
designees) receipt of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and Parents right to specific performance
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ will be the sole and exclusive remedies of
Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates against (A) the
Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates; and (B)
the former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates
(collectively, the "Company Related Parties") in respect of this Agreement,
any agreement executed in connection herewith (other than the Voting
Agreement, which will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms) and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(including with respect to any matters relating to CERCLA or any
other Environmental Law), and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Related Parties will have any further liability or obligation to
Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith (other than the Voting Agreement to
the extent set forth therein) or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement, including this  _Section_ __ _
8.3(f)(ii)_, shall relieve the Company from liability for any Willful and
Material Breach of this Agreement.

 



-86- 

    

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_,
it is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief as and to the
extent and only as and to the extent provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ (but
not, following the valid termination of this Agreement, with respect to the
Sections of this Agreement that do not survive such termination).

 

 _8.4 Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the
Company Board (or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the
Company has received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be
made to this Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders
pursuant to the DGCL without such approval. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the provisions relating to the Debt Financing
Sources Related Parties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, _Section_ __ _
8.6_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, the proviso to  _Section_ __
_ 9.9_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and this sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 8.4_ (and the defined terms used therein or any provision of
this Agreement related thereto) may not be amended, modified or altered
without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

_8.5 _ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as
otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Party, as applicable; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject
to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay
in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a
waiver of such right.

 

 _8.6_ _No Liabilities of Financing Sources_. None of the Debt Financing
Sources Related Parties will have any liability to the Company or any of its
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
otherwise, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ shall limit the rights
of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the Effective Time under any
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive debt documents executed in connection
with the Debt Financing (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, under this
Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party thereto.

_9.3 _ _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder, by operation of Law or otherwise,
without the prior written approval of the other Parties, except that Parent
will have the right to assign all or any portion of its rights and

in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or other
disposition of all or 

 



-89- 

    

 substantially all of the assets of Parent or the Surviving Corporation; or
(b) to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt Financing
for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as
collateral in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood that, in each
case, such assignment will not (i) affect the obligations of the parties
(including Debt Financing Sources) to the Financing Letters or Guarantor
pursuant to the Guarantee; or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the holders of Company
Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No assignment
by any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.
Any purported assignment of this Agreement without the consent required by
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ is null and void.

_9.4 _ _Confidentiality_ _Agreement_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby acknowledge that Centerbridge Advisors III, LLC and the Company have
previously executed a confidentiality letter agreement, dated October 2, 2018
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), that shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Representatives shall hold and treat all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished or made available to
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if they were parties thereto.

_9.5 Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Voting Agreement, the Guarantee and the Financing Letters, constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be superseded; (b) survive any
termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in full force and effect until
the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the date on which the
Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its terms or is validly
terminated by the parties thereto.

 

 _9.6_ _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Parties agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are
solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with and subject to
the terms of this Agreement and this Agreement is not intended to, and will
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the provisions of the last
sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_ __ _
8.6_, the proviso to  _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and this sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall inure to
the benefit of the Debt Financing Sources Related Parties, each of whom are
intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and
agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Debt
Financing Sources Related Parties), (b) the provisions of  _Article_ __ _
II_ and this sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall inure to the Company
Stockholders and the holders of Company Equity Awards entitled to
consideration thereunder (and only with regard to the consideration payable
thereto under _Article_ __ _ II_ from and after the Effective Time), each of
whom is intended to be a third party beneficiary thereof (it being understood
and agreed that, from and after the Effective Time, the provisions of such

 



-90- 

    

 Article and Section will be enforceable by the Common Stockholders and
holders of Company Equity Awards and their respective successors and assigns),
(c) the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ and this sentence of _Section_
__ _ 9.6_ shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnified Persons, each of whom
is intended to be a third party beneficiary thereof (it being understood and
agreed that, from and after the Effective Time, the provisions of such
Sections will be enforceable by the Indemnified Persons and their respective
successors and assigns), (d) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_
applicable to the Parent Related Parties and this sentence of _Section_ __ _
9.6_ shall inure to the benefit of the Parent Related Parties, each of whom is
intended to be a third party beneficiary thereof (it being understood and
agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Parent
Related Parties and their respective successors and assigns) and (e) the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_ applicable to the Company Related
Parties and this sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall inure to the benefit
of the Company Related Parties, each of whom is intended to be a third party
beneficiary thereof (it being understood and agreed that the provisions of
such Sections will be enforceable by the Company Related Parties and their
respective successors and assigns).

_9.7_ _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, or incapable of being
enforced under any applicable Law, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to
other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 

 _9.8_ _Remedies_.

(a)  _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party by this Agreement will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred upon a
Party by this Agreement, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, under no circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of
the Closing and payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate the Closing) subject in all cases to  _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(ii)_
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (in each case, other
than Parents and Merger Subs obligation to effect the Closing, which shall
be governed exclusively by _Section_

 



-91- 

    

  _9.8(b)(ii)_ ); (B) the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any Partys right to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(i)_, it is acknowledged and agreed
that the right of the Company to a remedy of specific performance to enforce
Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger is subject to the requirements that (A) all of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, provided that each such condition
is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date, assuming for
purposes hereof that the date of the order of specific performance is the
Closing Date); (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; (C) Parent and
Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.3_; and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to
Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that are required
of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event will the
Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents
obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the
Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

 

(iii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, including on the
basis that such injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief is
not an appropriate remedy or that an adequate remedy exists at law, subject
in all cases to _Section_ __ _ 9.8(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(ii)_. Any
Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

_9.9_ _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State
of Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Laws (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware; _provided_ that (except to the extent
relating to the interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement (including
any provision in any documentation related to the Debt Financing (including
the Debt Commitment Letter) that expressly specifies that the interpretation
of such provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
law of the State of Delaware)) any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any

 



-92- 

    

 Debt Financing Sources Related Party, arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the agreements entered into in
connection with the Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the laws
of another jurisdiction).

_9.10 Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger or the Guarantee, for and on behalf of
itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, and
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (b)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties
and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) (the
"Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of
this Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby; (c)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen
Courts; (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal
Proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or
claim the same; and (f) agrees that it shall not bring any Legal Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts
will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Debt Financing Source_ s. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties and each Debt Financing Sources
Related Party acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Legal Proceeding,
whether in Law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving any
Debt Financing Sources Related Party arising out of, or relating to, this

_9.14 Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being

counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or

communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.
