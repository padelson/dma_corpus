prompt notice (A)&nbsp;of any material breach (or written threatened breach) or material default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or material
default) by any party to the Financing Letters or, if applicable, definitive agreements related to the Financing; (B)&nbsp;of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or written communication from any Financing Source with respect
to any (1)&nbsp;actual or threatened material breach, material default, early termination or repudiation by any party to the Financing Letters or, if applicable, any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing
Letters or, if applicable, such definitive agreements; or (2)&nbsp;dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any
ordinary course negotiation with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing or Alternate Debt Financing); and (C)&nbsp;if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time reasonably believes that it will not be able to obtain at or prior to Closing
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Letters or, if applicable, any definitive agreements related to the Financing. Parent must provide any information in its possession
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event with two (2)&nbsp;Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written

alternative sources on conditions not less favorable in any respect to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and the related Fee Letter in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is
available, to pay all Financing Uses (the &#147;<B>Alternate Debt Financing</B>&#148;); and (ii)&nbsp;obtain one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing (the &#147;<B>New Debt Commitment
Letters</B>&#148;), which new letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters in whole or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which may be redacted so
long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the aggregate principal amount committed under the Debt Commitment Letters, conditionality, availability or termination of the Alternate Debt Financing) to the Company. In the event that
any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A)&nbsp;any reference in this Agreement to the &#147;Debt Commitment Letters&#148; will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a New Debt Commitment
