Rights</U>&#148;). One of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries exclusively owns each of the Company Proprietary Rights, free and clear of all Encumbrances. The Company Proprietary Rights are valid, subsisting and enforceable. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the rights of any Person in any Proprietary Rights, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since December&nbsp;31, 2005 infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated the rights of any Person in any Proprietary Rights other than in a <I>de minimis</I> respect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing, misappropriating or violating, nor has any Person infringed,
misappropriated or violated since December&nbsp;31, 2005 any of the Company Proprietary Rights. Except as Previously Disclosed, since December&nbsp;31, 2005, no charges, claims, proceedings or litigation have been asserted or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contesting the ownership, enforceability, or validity of any of the Company Proprietary Rights or challenging or questioning the right of the Company and its Subsidiaries to use
the Proprietary Rights of any Person, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no valid basis exists for the assertion of any such charge, claim, proceeding or litigation. All licenses and other Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party relating to Proprietary Rights are in full force and effect and constitute valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company or such Subsidiary, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, as the case may be, and there have
not been and there currently are not any defaults (or any event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any license or other Contract affecting Proprietary Rights used
in or necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as now conducted or as would reasonably be expected to be conducted in the future consistent with general banking business in the United States. The validity,
continuation and effectiveness of all licenses and other Contracts relating to the Proprietary Rights used in or necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as now conducted or as would reasonably be expected to be
conducted in the future consistent with general banking business in the United States, the current terms thereof, and the rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in and to the Company Proprietary Rights will not be adversely affected by the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable measures to protect the Proprietary Rights used in their businesses, including the confidentiality and value of all
Trade Secrets that are owned, used or held by the Company and its Subsidiaries, including by maintaining policies that require employees, licensees, consultants or other third parties with access to such Trade Secrets to keep such Trade Secrets
