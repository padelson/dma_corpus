follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

 _Section 1.01_ _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.03), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ").

 

 _Section 1.02_ _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing
between the Company and Purchaser, the closing for the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125
Broad Street, New York, New York, on the first business day  of the first calendar month (the " _Closing Date_ ") that follows the month
in which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _business day_ " shall mean any
day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Pacific Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a
day on which banks are required or authorized to close in the City of San
Francisco.

 

 _Section 1.03_ _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the
Closing, the Company and Purchaser shall cause a Certificate of Merger (the "
_Delaware Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section
251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time (i) when the
Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or (ii) at such later time as may be agreed by the
Parties in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (in
each case, the " _Effective Time_ ").

_Section 1.04_ _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in
its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_
"), until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws.

 

 _Section 1.05_ _Bylaws_. The Parties shall take all actions necessary so
that the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

 _Section 1.06_ _Directors_. The Parties hereto shall take all actions
necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

_Section 1.07_ _Bank Merger_. As soon as practicable after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, Bank and Union Bank, N.A., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Purchaser and a national banking association, duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. §
1 _et seq._  (" _Purchaser Bank_ "), will enter into a mutually agreed form
of agreement, pursuant to which Bank will merge or consolidate with and into
Purchaser Bank following the Effective Time (the " _Bank Merger_ ") in
accordance with the provisions of 12 U.S.C. §215a and 12 U.S.C. §1828(c). The
Parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective immediately
following the Effective Time.

 



\- 2 -  ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

_Section 2.01_ _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital
stock of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of the Company (a " _Share_ " or,
collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than (i) the Excluded Shares and (ii) Shares that
are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have perfected
and not effectively withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")) shall be converted into
the right to receive $46.00 per Share (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_
"), without interest. At the Effective Time, all the Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease
to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist, subject only to any rights the holder thereof may
have under Section 2.02(f).

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the holders of any Dissenting Share shall be entitled only to such
rights and payments as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose
such holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, each of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 2.02(g), and such holder thereof shall cease to have any
other rights with respect thereto.

(d) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

_Section 2.02_ _Exchange of Certificate_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Purchaser shall make available or
cause to be made available to a paying agent selected by Purchaser with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make payments under Section 2.01(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



\- 3 -  (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in Section 2.02(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal
to be in such form and have such other provisions as Purchaser and the
Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in Section 2.02(e)) in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.02(e)) to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.02(g)) equal to (x) the
number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.02(e)) multiplied by (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate previously
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) in the case of the Treasury Department and
(2) in the event that the Requisite Stockholder Approval in the form of the
Written Consent is delivered to the Company in accordance with Section 6.09,
any stockholder of the Company who shall have executed and delivered such
Written Consent, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Paying Agent to, from and
after the Effective Time, deliver the foregoing payments required under this
Section 2.02(b) to the Treasury Department and/or any such stockholder, as
applicable, immediately upon surrender by the Treasury Department and/or any
such stockholder, respectively, of its Certificates, without any requirement
in respect of such letter of transmittal.

(c) _No Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser or
the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the
Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article II.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.02(g)) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Purchaser, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws.

 



\- 4 -  (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Purchaser, the posting by such Person of a bond
in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Purchaser as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings)
equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such
Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company
shall give Purchaser (i) reasonably prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) to
the extent so remitted, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the
case may be.

 

 _Section 2.03_ _Stock Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Common Stock under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ "),
whether vested or unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into only the right to receive an amount
in cash (subject, in each case, to any withholding as provided in Section
2.02(g) and to Purchasers receipt of an option surrender agreement in the
form set forth on Section 2.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) equal to
the product of (A) the positive difference, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration _minus_ the exercise price per share of such Company Option

 



\- 5 -    _multiplied_ by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which amount shall be payable as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) business days after the
Effective Time. To the extent the exercise price of a Company Option is
greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be cancelled for no consideration. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the plans set forth in Section 2.03(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.

subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any of
the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is

become free of such restrictions and any repurchase right shall lapse, as of
the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (subject to any
withholdings as provided in Section 2.02(g)) with respect to each
such Company Restricted Share in accordance with Section 2.01(a).

_Section 2.05_ _Other Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right
of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Common Stock or
benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Common Stock, and each
award of any kind consisting of shares of Common Stock, including a deferred
share of Common Stock, granted under any of the Company Stock Plans that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Treasury
Warrant, Company Options and the Company Restricted Shares) (each, a "
_Company Stock Award_ ") shall vest in full and be cancelled and converted
into only the right to receive an amount in cash (subject, in each case, to
any withholding as provided in Section 2.02(g) and to Purchasers receipt of
a stock-based award surrender agreement in the form set forth on Section 2.05
of the Company Disclosure Schedule) equal to the product of (A) the Per Share
Merger Consideration _multiplied_ by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, which amount shall be payable as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) business days
after the Effective Time; _provided_ that, if a Company Stock Award
constitutes "non-qualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code, the cash payment in respect of such Company Stock
Award as determined hereunder shall be paid at such time or times as is
provided under the applicable plan or award agreement governing such Company
Stock Award.

_Section 2.06_ _Treasury Warrants_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each outstanding Treasury Warrant (as defined
in Section 3.02(b)), shall cease to represent a warrant to purchase Common
Stock and shall be converted automatically into a right to exercise such
Treasury Warrant in accordance with the terms of such Treasury Warrant to
receive an amount in cash (subject to any withholding as provided in Section
2.02(g)) equal to (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration _multiplied_ by (B)
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
Treasury Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Treasury
Warrant Consideration_ "), which amount shall be payable following the
Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.06(b).

 



\- 6 -  (b) The foregoing payment set forth in clause (a) may be made by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, or at Purchasers election, the Paying Agent. From and
after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Paying Agent to,
deliver the Treasury Warrant Consideration to the U.S. Department of the
Treasury (" _Treasury Department_ ") or any other holder of Treasury Warrants
(solely with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by such Treasury
Warrants) immediately upon surrender by such holder of its Treasury Warrants
and payment of the then-applicable exercise price in respect thereof in
accordance with the terms of such Treasury Warrants (it being agreed that to
the extent practicable, the Treasury Warrant shall be net settled). In the
event any Treasury Warrants shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, a
holder of such Treasury Warrants shall have to make and deliver to Purchaser
or the Surviving Corporation an affidavit of that fact by such holder and an
agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser indemnifying Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made against
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Treasury Warrants.

(a) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of Employees who are actively employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide
employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the aggregate, are
no less favorable than the employee benefits (other than severance benefits,
which, for the avoidance of doubt, are governed under Section 6.03(b)) and
compensation opportunities that are generally made available to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (other than the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the " _Purchaser Plans_ "),
as applicable; _provided_ that (i) with respect to retirement benefits,
satisfaction of the foregoing standard shall not require that any Covered
Employee be eligible to participate in any specific retirement plan of
Purchaser or a closed or frozen Purchaser Plan; and (ii) until such time as
Purchaser shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the Purchaser
Plans, a Covered Employees continued participation in the employee benefit
plans and compensation opportunities of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be deemed to satisfy the
foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation
in the Purchaser Plans may commence at different times with respect to each
Purchaser Plan).

 



\- 43 -  (b) Purchaser shall provide severance benefits in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the special severance policy set forth on Section 6.03(b) of
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule (" _Special Severance Policy_ ") to Covered
Employees who experience a qualifying termination of employment
with Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
60th day following the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Special
Severance Period_ "). Each Covered Employee whose employment is terminated
after the Special Severance Period shall be eligible to participate in
Purchasers regular separation and severance pay programs on the same terms
and conditions as other similarly-situated employees of Purchaser.

(c) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
Purchaser Plan, Purchaser shall cause such plan to (i) recognize the service
of such Covered Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under any Purchaser Plan that is a
defined benefit pension plan or a retiree medical plan )under such Purchaser
Plan, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the
Effective Time under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that such recognition of service (A) shall not operate to duplicate
any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service
and (B) shall not apply for purposes of any Purchaser Plan under which
similarly-situated employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service; and (ii) with respect to any Purchaser Plan that
provides health plan or other welfare benefits in which any Covered Employee
is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is
first eligible to participate, (A) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Purchaser Plan to be
waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation
would have been waived or satisfied under the Benefit Plan in which such
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
(B) recognize any eligible expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the
year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Purchaser Plan.

(d) If requested by Purchaser by no later than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent
upon, the Closing, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and/or amendments
to terminate the Company Retirement Savings Plan or any 401(k) plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_
") and the Covered Employees shall be permitted to roll any eligible rollover
distributions (including, to the extent applicable with respect to any
Covered Employee, loans) into Purchasers 401(k) plan. If the Companys 401(k)
Plan is terminated as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, each Covered
Employee who participated or was eligible to participate in the Company
401(k) Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be eligible to
participate in Purchasers 401(k) plan commencing on the Closing Date. If the
Company 401(k) is not terminated as of immediately prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall maintain the Company 401(k) Plan for the benefit of the
Covered Employees until such time as they are eligible to participate in
Purchasers 401(k) Plan and Purchaser will make a 

 



\- 44 -   discretionary matching contribution at a rate for each Covered Employee
participating in the Company 401(k) Plan equal to the Companys 2011
discretionary matching contribution rate for the 2012 plan year.

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall be construed to limit the right of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing Date,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall
anything in this Section 6.03 be construed to require Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) to maintain any Purchaser Plan or retain the employment
of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time following the
Closing Date. This Agreement shall inure exclusively to the benefit of, and be
binding upon the Parties hereto and their respective successors,
assigns, executors and legal representatives. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, including without limitation this Section 6.03, is
intended to confer on any person other than the Parties hereto or their
respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification by the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance (providing only
for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies
also include Side B coverage for the Company) with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided, however_ , that in
no event shall the Company expend for "tail" insurance policies a premium

 



\- 45 -   amount in excess of the amount set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule.
If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for
such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as
favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 250% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.04(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify Purchaser; _provided_ that failure to so
notify will not affect the obligations of Purchaser under Section 6.04(a)
unless and to the extent that Purchaser is actually and materially prejudiced
as a consequence.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such individual may have under the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or other governing documents) of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or any other applicable Laws or under
any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. If Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity
and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then
and in each case, Purchaser will cause proper provision to be made so that

applicable, will assume the obligations of Purchase or the Surviving
Corporation, respectively, set forth in this Section 6.04.

contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 as promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
providing for the acquisition of more than 50% of the assets (on
a consolidated basis) or total voting power of the equity securities of the
Company if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information
an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the
other party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
substantially concurrently (and in any event within 24 hours) discloses (and,
if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Purchaser to the
extent not previously provided to Purchaser; (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after having complied with all
requirements of Section 6.06(c) and Section 6.06(d), approve, recommend, or
otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to
the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B)
or (C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action, in light of the
Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) in each such
case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the Company Board has determined
in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C)
above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal.

Company Board Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare
advisable any Superior Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that was
not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in breach of this
Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable law (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "); _provided, however_ , that no Change of Recommendation may
be made, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no action referred to in Section
6.06(b)(C) shall be taken, until after at least 72 hours following
Purchasers receipt of notice from the Company advising that the Company
currently intends to take such action and the basis therefor, including all
necessary information under Section 6.06(f). In determining whether to make a
Change of Recommendation or, for the avoidance of doubt, whether to take any
action referred to in Section 6.06(b)(C), in response to a Superior Proposal
or otherwise, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Purchaser and any other information
provided by Purchaser in response to such notice. Any material amendment to
any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.06, including with respect to the notice periods
referred to in this Section 6.06(d) and Section 6.06(f).

terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly
inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.06 and in the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will promptly request each Person

hours) notify Purchaser if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is requested
from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be initiated or
continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests,

 



\- 48 -   proposals or offers, including proposed Contracts) and thereafter shall keep
Purchaser informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto)
and any material changes in the status of any such discussions or
negotiations, including any change in the Companys intentions as previously
notified.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such
Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant
to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement, and nothing in this
clause (g) shall permit the Company to take any action otherwise contemplated
by this Section 6.06 without compliance herewith.

or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter

Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

by wire transfer of same day funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Termination Fee shall be payable to Purchaser pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 8.02(c) unless and until within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into
an

 



\- 56 -   Alternate Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated
or shall have approved or recommended to the Companys stockholders or
otherwise not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal (substituting in both
instances "50%" for "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal");
_provided_ that for purposes of clause (i) of this Section 8.02(c), an
Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to have been "publicly withdrawn" by
any Person if, within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement) with respect to, or shall
have consummated or shall have approved or recommended to the Companys
stockholders or otherwise not opposed, an Acquisition Proposal made by or on
behalf of such Person or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that
in the event that such Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the
Company to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 8.02(c), except in the event of
fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its
Affiliates, the Termination Fee shall be Purchasers and Merger Subs sole and
exclusive remedy arising out of a termination of this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated (a) by Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(b) and at the time of such termination, the Company is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement; (b) by Purchaser or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(c) and, at the time of such termination, (i) the condition to
closing set forth in Section 7.01(c) has not been satisfied or waived in
writing, (ii) all the other conditions to closing set forth in Section 7.01
and Section 7.02 shall have been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied)
or waived in writing and (iii) the Company is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement or (c) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(d) based upon a
material breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of Section 4.01(g), 5.01 or 6.01,
then, in light of the Companys postponement or cancellation of planned
upgrades of its information technology systems and the costs the Company will
incur in complying with its cooperation obligations set forth in Section
6.02(a), Purchaser shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
days after the date of any such termination, reimburse the Company by wire
transfer of same day funds for all fees, expenses and costs determined by the
Company in good faith to have been expended or incurred by it in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the termination of
this Agreement, including in respect of counsel, investment bankers,
information technology systems and core systems conversion and employee time;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall not be required to reimburse the Company more
than $25,000,000. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other Party would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Party that owes a payment
pursuant to this Section 8.02 fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.02(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party
commences a suit that results in a final, nonappealable judgment against such
owing Party for the applicable amount set forth in this Section 8.02 or any
portion of such fee, such owing Party shall pay to the other Party its
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

_Section 8.03_ _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section
8.02 and except with respect to (x) costs and expenses of printing and
mailing the Proxy Statement or Information Statement, as applicable, and (y)
all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger, each
of which in the case of clause (x) or clause (y) shall be borne

 



\- 57 -   equally by the Company and Purchaser, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated.

_Section 8.04_ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained in this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other Party
with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

_Section 9.05_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Party, it being understood that each Party need not
sign the same counterpart.

 



\- 59 -  _Section 9.06_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any
exhibits hereto, the documents and the instruments referred to in this
Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

_Section 9.07_  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances
other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will
remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination, the parties will negotiate in
good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable
substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.

_Section 9.08_ _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
applicable to contracts made and entirely to be performed within such state,
without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles that
would require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction;
_provided_ that the DGCL, including the provisions thereof governing the
fiduciary duties of directors of a Delaware corporation, shall govern as
applicable. The Parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding
brought by either Party to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether in tort or contract or at law or in equity,
exclusively, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or
future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each Party hereto
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum or
that such Party is not subject to personal jurisdiction in such court.

_Section 9.09_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereto acknowledges and
agrees that any controversy that may arise under this Agreement is likely to
involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising
out of, or relating to, this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no
representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each Party understands
and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each Party makes this
waiver voluntarily and (d) each Party has been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 9.09.

 



\- 60 -  _Section 9.10_ _Publicity_. Neither the Company nor Purchaser shall,
and neither the Company nor Purchaser shall permit any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives to, issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make
any public statement, or, except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic information to a third party,
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Purchaser,
in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by the Company
or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives, or the Company, in
the case of a proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that either Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party (but after
prior consultation with the other Party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by Law or by the rules and
regulations of NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange.

 

 _Section 9.11_ _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement shall be assigned by either of the Parties (whether by operation of
law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any attempted or purported
assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by each of the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Except for Section 6.04, which is intended to benefit each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, this Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not
intended to and does not confer upon any person other than the Parties hereto
any rights or remedies under this Agreement including, without limitation, the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.

 

 _Section 9.12_ _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly
