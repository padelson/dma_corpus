AGREEMENT  OF MERGER

 

 

 

 

This  Agreement of Merger dated as of December 26, 2006 (this " **Agreement**
")  is  among Cenveo, Inc., a Colorado corporation (" **Parent** "), 
Mouse  Acquisition Corp., a Virginia corporation and an indirect wholly
owned  subsidiary of Parent (" **Merger  Sub** "),  and  Cadmus
Communications Corporation, a Virginia corporation (the " **Company** "). 
Capitalized terms used but not defined elsewhere herein have the meanings 
assigned to them in Section 8.15.

 

 

The  respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
desire  to  enter into a transaction whereby Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company  (the " **Merger** "),  pursuant to which each issued and
outstanding share of the Company's common  stock, par value $0.50 per share
(" **Company  Common Stock** "),  not  owned directly or indirectly by the
Company will be converted into the right  to  receive the Merger
Consideration.

 

 

In  furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger
Sub  and the Company have adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated  hereby, including, without limitation, the Merger. The Board of
Directors of  the  Company has recommended that its shareholders approve
this Agreement and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without  limitation, the Merger.

 

 

Concurrently  with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and  inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to
enter into this  Agreement, Parent and certain of the Company's shareholders
are entering into a  Voting Agreement (the **" Voting  Agreement"**) 
with  respect to the voting of Company Common Stock in connection with the 
Merger.

 

 

Parent,  Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties  and agreements in connection with, and to prescribe certain
conditions to,  the  Merger.

 

 

In  consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations,  warranties and agreements set forth herein, and intending
to be legally bound,  the parties agree as follows:

(b) All  shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and

made or  delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(d) Each  share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

Section  1.9. _Company  Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 

 

(a) Awards  of  restricted shares of Company Common Stock from the Company
(collectively, " **Company  Restricted Shares** ")  granted under the
Cadmus Communications Corporation FY 2005-2007 Executive  Long-Term Incentive
Plan, as corrected April 18, 2005 (the **" LTIP**"),  shall  vest,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the extent provided under 
Section 8(b) of the LTIP and, as of the Effective Time, such vested Company 
Restricted Shares shall become shares of Company Common Stock that are
converted  into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in

immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the preceding sentence 
shall  be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist as of

(b) All  outstanding options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock from
the Company  (collectively, " **Company  Stock Options** ")  heretofore
granted under any Company Stock Plan shall become exercisable and  vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time and cease to represent, as of  the 
Effective Time, a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall 
be  converted, in settlement and cancellation thereof, into the right to
receive,  at  the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment by the Surviving
Corporation of  an  amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the per
share Merger  Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock  subject to such Company Stock Option, _multiplied  by_   (ii)
the  number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock
Option  shall not theretofore have been exercised.

 

 

(c) No  Person  shall have any right under the Company Stock Plans or under
any other plan,  program, agreement or arrangement with respect to equity
interests of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for the issuance or
grant of any right  of  any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive benefits
measured by the value  of a  number of shares of Company Common Stock
(including restricted stock units,  deferred stock units and dividend


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

equivalents),  at and after the Effective Time (except as otherwise expressly
set forth in  this  Section 1.9 or Article 2).

 

 

(d) Promptly  after the Effective Time and not later than three Business Days
after the  Closing Date (unless additional time is required to process
payments under  the  Company's payroll systems), the Surviving Corporation
shall pay to each holder  of Company Stock Options the cash payments
specified in this Section 1.9. The  Company's payroll processor shall be
instructed to promptly pay the holders of  Company Stock Options the amounts
they are entitled to receive hereunder. No  interest shall be paid or accrue
on the cash payments contemplated by this  Section 1.9. The Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct  and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement  to any holder of
Company Stock Options any Taxes that either of them is required  or permitted
to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. To the extent that  amounts are
so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent  and  paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority, the amounts so deducted and 
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been 
paid  to the holder of the Company Stock Options in respect of which such
deduction  and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case  may  be, and the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent shall provide  to  the holders of such securities written notice of
the amounts so deducted or  withheld.

 

 

(e) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts  to  effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.9,
including the conversion of  each  Company Stock Option into the right to
receive an amount in cash as described  in  Section 1.9(b). Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Section 1.9, payment  may be withheld in respect
of any employee stock option until such necessary  consents are obtained.

 

 

Section  1.10. _Certain  Adjustments_.  If,  between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time: (a) the outstanding  shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed  into or exchanged
for a different number of shares or different class, in each  case, by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,  split-up,
combination or exchange of shares; (b) a stock dividend or dividend  payable
in any other securities of the Company shall be declared with a record  date
within such period; or (c) any similar event shall have occurred, then  in 
each instance referred to in the preceding clauses (a) through (c) the
Merger  Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders
of shares  of Company Common Stock (and Company Stock Options) the same
economic effect  as  contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

CONVERSION  OF SHARES

 

 

Section  2.1. _Paying  Agent_.  At or  prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate, and enter into an agreement  with, a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as  paying agent in the Merger
(the " **Paying  Agent** ").  Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent as

Common Stock, cash sufficient to  effect the payment of the Merger
Consideration to which such holders are  entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(a)
and this Article 2.

Section  2.2. _Payment  Procedures_.  As  promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than three Business Days after  the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder  of record of one or more
certificates that, prior to the Effective Time,  represented shares of
Company Common Stock that were converted into the right  to  receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(a) (the " **Certificates** "): 
(a) a  letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected,  and  risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of  the  Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such  other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and
(b) instructions for  use  in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger  Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying  Agent or to such other agent or agents as Parent
may appoint, together with  such  letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed, and such other documents  as  the Paying Agent may reasonably
require, the holder of such Certificate shall  be  entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in exchange for each share of  Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the  Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be  paid or accrue on the
Merger Consideration. If any portion of the Merger  Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name  the  applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, then it shall be a condition  to the
payment of such Merger Consideration that (i) the Certificate so  surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form  for 
transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall have (A) paid any 
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other 
than  that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or (B)
established  to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any such Taxes
either have been  paid or are not payable.

 

 

Section  2.3. _Undistributed  Merger Consideration_.  Any  portion of the
funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section  2.1  that
remains undistributed to holders of Certificates on the date that is one 
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, 
and  any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article  2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
to which  such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and this
Article 2. Any  portion of the funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section  2.1  that remains unclaimed by holders of Certificates
on the date that is five  years  after the Effective Time or such earlier
date immediately prior to such time  as  such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental  Entity shall, to the
extent permitted by Law, become the property of the  Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person  previously entitled
thereto.

 

 

Section  2.4. _No  Liability_.  None of  Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent  or  their respective directors,
officers, employees and representatives shall be  liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a  public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or  similar Law.

 

 

Section  2.5. _Investment  of Merger Consideration_.  The  Paying Agent
shall invest the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant  to
Section 2.1 as directed by Parent on a daily basis in obligations of or 
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and 
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated  A-2/P-2 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. and Standard and
Poor's  Corporation, respectively (or money market funds rated Aaa or better
by Moody's  Investors Services, Inc. or AAA or better by Standard and Poor's
Corporation);  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no  such gain or loss
thereon shall affect


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  amounts payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 1.8(a)
and this  Article 2. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall  be the property of, and shall promptly be paid to, Parent.

 

 

Section  2.6. _Lost  Certificates_.  If any  Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making  of  an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting  by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation  may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with  respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for  such  lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with 
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented  thereby.

 

 

Section  2.7. _Withholding  Rights_.  The  Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct  and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement  to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the making  of  such payment
that either of them is required or entitled to deduct and withhold  under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** "),  or  any
provision of any other Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted 
and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent and paid over to the 
appropriate taxing authority, the amounts so deducted and withheld shall be 
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder 
of  such shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and  withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may  be,  and the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
provide to  the  holders of such securities written notice of the amounts so
deducted or  withheld.

 

 

Section  2.8. _Further  Assurances_.  At and  after the Effective Time,
the officers and directors of the Surviving  Corporation will be authorized
to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf  of the Company or Merger
Sub, all deeds, bills of sale, assignments and  assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or  Merger Sub, all other
actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record  or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation all right, title and interest in,  to  and under all
of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired  by  the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the  Merger.

 

 

Section  2.9. _Stock  Transfer Books_.  The  stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed immediately upon the  Effective Time, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers of  shares of Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of the Company. At  or  after the Effective Time,
any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, Parent  or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason shall, subject to compliance with  the provisions
of this Article 2 by the holder thereof, be converted into the  right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company 
Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

 

 

ARTICLE  3

incorporation or organization and has full corporate or  other power and

Effect on the Company. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
licensed  or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in
good standing,  in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the properties
owned or leased  by  it, or the nature of its business, makes such licensing
or qualification  necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified, individually  or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have  a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The copies of the articles of  incorporation and bylaws of the Company,
including any amendments thereto,  that  have been made available by the
Company to Parent prior to the date of this  Agreement are correct and
complete copies of such instruments as presently  in  effect.

subject  to  Company Stock Options, the number of unvested Company

units,  commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to
which the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them is bound:  (A) obligating the Company or any of

its  Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered

stock  of or other equity interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any  Company Voting Debt; (B) obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  to  issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option,

issued and outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests 
of  its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges,

Company's Subsidiaries, together with  the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of each Subsidiary and the  percentage of each Subsidiary's
outstanding capital stock or other equity  interests owned by the Company or
another of its Subsidiaries, is set forth  in  _Schedule  3.2(b)-1_   to
the  Company Disclosure Schedule. A correct and complete list of all
corporations,  partnerships, limited liability companies, associations and
other entities  (excluding the Company's Subsidiaries) in which the Company
or any Subsidiary of  the Company owns any joint venture, partnership,
strategic alliance or similar  interest, together with the jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization of  each such entity and the percentage of each
such entity's outstanding capital  stock or other equity interests owned by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  is set forth in _Schedule 
3.2(b)-2_   to the  Company Disclosure Schedule. Except for its interest in
the Subsidiaries, joint  venture or similar entities as set forth in
_Schedule  3.2(b)-2_   to the  Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
does not own, directly or indirectly,  any capital stock interest, equity
membership interest, partnership interest,  joint venture interest or other

Subsidiaries is obligated to make any contribution to  the  capital of, make
any loan to or guarantee the debts of any joint venture or  similar entity

(c) Parent  has prior to the date of this Agreement received a correct and
complete copy  of  each Company Stock Plan.

 

 

Section  3.3. _Authorization_.  The  Company has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this  Agreement and the related Plan of
Merger and to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby,

Section  3.4. _No  Violation_.

 

 

(a) The  execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the  consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions 
contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, 
or  constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)

under, or to  increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements of  any  Person under, or create any obligation to make a
payment to any other Person  under, or result in the creation of a Lien on,

regulations of the SEC with respect  thereto, have been prepared in

thereto) and fairly present, in all  material respects, the consolidated
financial position and consolidated results  of operations and cash flows of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries  as  of the respective dates
or for the respective periods set forth therein,  subject, in the case of the
unaudited interim financial statements, to the  absence of notes and normal

Company SEC  Reports, and the Company has made available to Parent a summary
of any  disclosure made by the Company's management to the Company's auditors
and the  audit committee of the Company's Board of Directors referred to in
such  certifications. (For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal
executive  officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings
ascribed to  such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.)

 

 

(e) The  Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as  defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to  provide reasonable assurance to the Company and its Board of
Directors (i)  that  the Company maintains records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly  reflect their respective transactions and dispositions
of assets, (ii) that  transactions of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
recorded as necessary  to  permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (iii) that  receipts and expenditures of the Company
and its Subsidiaries are executed  only  in accordance with authorizations
of management and the Board of Directors  of  the Company and (iv) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the  unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that could  have a material effect on the
Company's financial statements. The Company has  evaluated the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial  reporting and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any  applicable Company SEC
Report that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or  any  amendment thereto
its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal  control over
financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such  report or
amendment based on such evaluation. To the extent required by  applicable
Law, the Company has disclosed, in any applicable Company SEC Report  that is
a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto, any change  in
the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during 
the period covered by such report or amendment that has materially affected, 
or  is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control
over  financial reporting. The Company has disclosed, based on the most
recent  evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the
Company's  auditors and the audit committee of the Company's Board of
Directors (A) all  significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation  of  internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to  adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report  financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves  management or other employees who
have a significant role in the Company's  internal control over financial
reporting.

 

 

(f) The  Company has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material  information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries,  is  made known to its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer.  The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company's disclosure controls  and procedures and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, presented in  any  applicable Company SEC Report that is
a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or  any  amendment thereto its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure  controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report  or  amendment
based on such evaluation.

(g) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  3.5(g)_   to the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, the date of each Company Stock Option that is  reflected
in the Company's books and records is the actual date of grant thereof  (as
determined under GAAP). All Company Stock Options were granted with an 
exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of Company Stock on 
the  date of grant of such Company Stock Option and no Company Stock Option
has  been  amended to reduce the exercise price from that in effect on the
date of grant  (except pursuant to non-discretionary antidilution provisions
governing such  Company Stock Option). The financial statements of the
Company included in  the  Company SEC Reports fairly reflect in all material
respects amounts required  to  be shown as expense in connection with the
grant and/or amendment of any Company  Stock Option.

fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein  or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that the 
Company makes no representation regarding information provided in writing by 
Parent or its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy 
Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements  of the Exchange Act.

by resolutions duly adopted by the unanimous  vote at a meeting duly called
and held and not subsequently rescinded or  modified in any way (the "

Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (" **ERISA** "),  other  than any Multiemployer Plan, and all other
material employee benefits,  arrangements, perquisite programs, payroll
practices or (without regard to  materiality) executive compensation
Contracts that are maintained by the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries or
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  is  obligated to
contribute, for current or former employees or directors (or  dependents or
beneficiaries thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries 
(collectively, the " **Employee  Benefit Plans** "). 

 

 

(b) _Schedule  3.14(b)_   to the  Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
correct and complete list of all Multiemployer  Plans. With respect to each
Multiemployer Plan: (i) if the Company, any of  its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate was to experience a withdrawal or  partial withdrawal from such
plan, no withdrawal liability under Title IV of  ERISA would be


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-17-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incurred,  except as set forth on such schedule; and (ii) none of the
Company, any of  its  Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has received any
notification, nor has  any  reason to believe, that any Multiemployer Plan
is in reorganization, has been  terminated, is insolvent or may reasonably be
expected to be in reorganization,  to be insolvent or to be terminated.
During the last five years, none of the  Company, its current or former
Subsidiaries or any current or former ERISA  Affiliate has (i) withdrawn from
any Multiemployer Plan in a complete or partial  withdrawal under
circumstances in which any withdrawal liability was not  satisfied in full or
(ii) engaged in a transaction that is subject to Section  4069 of ERISA.
During the last five years, none of the Company, any of its  Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate is or has ever been a party to any multiple  employer
plan, as that term is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code, or a  multiple
employer welfare arrangement, as that term is defined in Section 3(40)  of
ERISA.

 

 

(c) Except  as  set forth in _Schedule  3.14(c)_   to the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan subject  to
Title IV of ERISA: (i) the  present value of all accrued benefits under each
such single employer plan  (based on the assumptions used to fund the plan)
did not as of the last annual  actuarial valuation date exceed the value of
the assets of such single employer  plan allocable to such accrued benefits,
and no event has occurred since  valuation date, and no condition exists,
which is reasonably likely to  materially increase the funding or accounting
costs for such single employer  plans; (ii) no  proceeding has been
initiated or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened  by  any Person
(including the PBGC) to terminate any such plan; (iii) no "reportable  event"
(as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any  such
plan, and no such reportable event will occur as a result of the 
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) no such plan that is subject to 
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code has incurred an "accumulated 
funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of
the  Code), whether or not such deficiency has been waived.  None  of  the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any 
outstanding liability under Section 4062, 4063 or 4064 of ERISA to the
Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" **PBGC** ")  or to  a trustee
appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA. None of the Employee Benefit  Plans or
any other plan, fund or program ever maintained or contributed to  by  the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate that is subject  to 
Title IV of ERISA has been terminated so as to subject, directly or
indirectly,  any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
liability,  contingent or otherwise, or the imposition of any Lien under
Title IV of ERISA. 

 

 

(d) The  Company and each of its Subsidiaries have reserved the right to
amend, terminate  or modify at any time all Employee Benefit Plans, except as
limited by the  terms  of a collective bargaining agreement or contract with
an individual or to the  extent applicable Law would prohibit the Company or
any Subsidiary from so  reserving or exercising such right.

 

 

(e) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  3.14(e)_   to the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Internal Revenue Service has issued a currently 
effective favorable determination letter with respect to each Employee
Benefit  Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of
Section 401  of the Code, and each trust maintained pursuant thereto has been
determined  to  be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of
the Code by the  IRS.  Each such Employee Benefit Plan has been timely
amended since the date of the  latest favorable determination letter in
accordance with all applicable Laws.  Nothing has occurred


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-18-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect to the operation of any such Employee Benefit Plan that is
reasonably  likely to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or
the imposition  of  any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code or
the assertion of claims  by "participants" (as that term is defined in
Section 3(7) of ERISA) other than  routine benefit claims.

 

 

(f) None  of  the Company, its Subsidiaries, the officers or directors of
the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries or the Employee Benefit Plans that
are subject to ERISA,  any  trusts created thereunder or any trustee or
administrator thereof has engaged  in  a "prohibited transaction" (as such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or  Section 4975 of the Code) or any
other breach of fiduciary responsibility that  could subject the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any officer or director  of  the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any tax or penalty on prohibited  transactions imposed by
such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section  502  of ERISA.

 

 

(g) Except  as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably  be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
there are no claims  (except claims for benefits payable in the ordinary
course of business  consistent with past practice and proceedings with
respect to qualified domestic  relations orders), suits or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the  Company, threatened against or involving
any Employee Benefit Plan, asserting  any rights or claims to benefits under
any Employee Benefit Plan or asserting  any claims against any administrator,
fiduciary or sponsor thereof. Except  as,  individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, there are no pending  or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened investigations by any  Governmental Entity involving any
Employee Benefit Plans.

 

 

(h) All  Employee Benefit Plans have been established, maintained and
administered in  accordance with their terms and with all provisions of
applicable Laws,  including ERISA and the Code, except for instances of
noncompliance where  neither the costs to comply nor the failure to comply,
individually or in the  aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse  Effect on the Company. All contributions or
premiums required to be made with  respect to an Employee Benefit Plan,
whether by law or pursuant to the terms  of  the plan or any contract that
funds the benefits due thereunder, have been  made  when due. With respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan the liabilities of which  have been disclosed on
the Company's financial statements as included in the  Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, no event has  occurred since the
date of such disclosure that has resulted in a material  increase in such
liabilities.

 

 

(i) Except  as  set forth on _Schedule  3.14(i)_   to the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this  Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either  alone
or in conjunction with any other event) will: (i) increase any benefits 
otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan; (ii) result in any 
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits; (iii) 
limit  or prohibit the ability to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit
Plan; (iv)  require the funding of any trust or other funding vehicle; or (v)
renew or  extend the term of any agreement in respect of compensation for an
employee  of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would create any


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-19-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation  or  their respective Affiliates after consummation of the
Merger.

 

 

(j) Except  as  set forth in _Schedule  3.14(j)_   of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  is  a
party to a Contract (including this Agreement) that under any circumstances 
could obligate it to make payments (either before or after the Closing Date) 
that will not be deductible because of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the 
Code. _Schedule  3.14(j)_   to the  Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
each Employee Benefit Plan that provides  for a payment upon a change in
control and/or any subsequent employment  termination (including any
agreement that provides for the cash-out or  acceleration of options or
restricted stock and any "gross-up" payments with  respect to any of the
foregoing), but excluding severance plans that are  generally applicable to
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

 

 

(k) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided written
communications  to  any group of its current or former employees or any of
its directors of any  intention or commitment to establish or implement any
additional material  Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
arrangement or to amend or  modify, in any material respect, any existing
Employee Benefit  Plan.

 

 

(l) With  respect to each Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to the Law of

Plan** "),  except as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company: (i)  all  employer and employee contributions to each Foreign
Benefit Plan required by  Law  or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan
have been made or, if applicable,  accrued in accordance with normal
accounting practices; (ii) the fair market  value of the assets of each
funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each  insurer for any Foreign
Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book  reserve established for
any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued  contributions, is
sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit  obligations with
respect to all current and former participants in such plan  according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to  determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and no  transaction
contemplated by this Agreement will cause such assets, insurance  obligations
or book reserve to be less than such benefit obligations; (iii)  all 
Foreign Benefit Plans have been maintained in accordance with their terms
and  all requirements of applicable Law; (iv) each Foreign Benefit Plan
required  to  be registered has been registered and has been maintained in
good standing  with  the appropriate Governmental Entities; and (v) to the
extent any Foreign Benefit  Plan is intended to qualify for special tax
treatment, such Foreign Benefit  Plan  meets all requirements for such
treatment. There is no Foreign Benefit Plan  with  respect to which the
Company is obligated to make disclosure in the Company  SEC  Reports where
the Company has not made the disclosure so required. The Company  has prior
to the date of this Agreement provided Parent with a correct and  complete
list of all Foreign Benefit Plans.

 

 

(m) Each  "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of  the Code) of  the Company has been operated since January 1,
2005 in good faith compliance  with Section  409A of  the Code, IRS Notice

to  any  comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall
provide Parent  with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such

copy of all such filings with, and all  such  responses delivered to, the
SEC.

 

 

(b) The  Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, duly take all
lawful action  to  call, give written notice of, convene and hold a meeting

Company shall not withdraw, modify or qualify  (or  propose to withdraw,
modify or qualify or publicly announce that it is  considering withdrawing,
modifying or qualifying) in any manner adverse to  Parent such recommendation
or take any action or make any statement in  connection with the Company
Shareholders Meeting inconsistent with such  recommendation, including a
recommendation by the Company's Board of Directors  of an Acquisition
Proposal (collectively, a " **Change  in Company Recommendation** "); 
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Board of Directors of the Company may
make a Change in the Company  Recommendation in accordance with, and subject
to the limitations set forth  in,  Section 5.5. The Company shall adjourn
the Company Shareholders Meeting (x)  from  time to time at the written
request of Parent for up to 10 days upon each such  request in the event
there shall not be a quorum at the Company Shareholders  Meeting and (y) on
one occasion at the written request of Parent for up to  10  days in the
event Parent reasonably believes based on information from the  Company and
its proxy solicitor that less than a majority of the shares of  Company
Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger intend to or have voted 
"against", and less than a majority of such shares intend to or have
voted "for", approval and adoption of this Agreement and the related Plan
of  Merger.

 

 

Section  5.3. _Access  and Information_.

 

 

(a) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to,  upon  reasonable notice, afford Parent and its counsel,
accountants, consultants  and  other authorized representatives reasonable
access, during normal business  hours, to the employees, properties, books

the Company  shall cause its officers and employees to (x) furnish such
financial and  operating data and other information as may be reasonably
requested by Parent  from time to time and (y) respond to such reasonable
inquiries as may be made  by  Parent from time to time. Prior to their

the transactions contemplated hereby), and the Company  shall keep Parent
informed of such events. Parent shall provide the Company  with  prompt
written notice of the institution or, to its knowledge, the threat of 
litigation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section  5.4. _Reasonable  Best Efforts_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  the Company and Parent shall cooperate with and assist the
other party, and  shall use its reasonable best efforts, to promptly (i)
take, or cause to be  taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper  or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated  hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing
and filing as promptly as  practicable all documentation to effect all
necessary filings, notices,  petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications  and other documents, and (ii)
obtain and maintain all approvals, consents,  registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to  be  obtained from any
other Person, including any Governmental Entity, that are  necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Merger and other transactions  contemplated

the Termination Date. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated hereby, 
each of the Company and Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries 
not  to, take any action or knowingly omit to take any action within its
reasonable  control where such action or omission would, or would reasonably
be expected  to,  result in (A) any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article 6 not  being satisfied prior to the Termination Date or (B)
a material delay in the  satisfaction of such conditions. Neither Parent nor
the Company will directly  or  indirectly extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or other Regulatory  Laws  or enter into any agreement with a
Governmental Entity to delay or not to  consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except with the  prior  written consent of
the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld  in light of
closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before  the
Termination Date.

 

 

(b) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
shall  (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant  to the HSR Act, apply for early termination thereunder and make
appropriate  filings under all other applicable Regulatory Laws with respect
to the  transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the
date  of  this Agreement (but in no event shall such Notification and Report
Form be  filed  more than 10 days after the date of this Agreement), (ii)
supply as promptly  as  practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be  requested pursuant to the HSR Act and any
other applicable Regulatory Laws  and  (iii) take all other actions

(c) In  connection with this Section 5.4, the parties hereto shall (i)
cooperate in  all  respects with each other in connection with any filing,
submission,  investigation or inquiry, (ii) promptly inform the other party
of any  communication received by such party from, or given by such party to,
the  Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " **DOJ** "), 
the  Federal Trade Commission (the " **FTC** ")  or any  other Governmental
Entity and of any material communication received or given  in  connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case, regarding  any  of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) have the right to review in  advance,
and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other on, any  filing
made with, or written materials to be submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC  or 
any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private  party, any other Person, in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated  hereby, and (iv) consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, discussion,  telephone call or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental  Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other  Person, and to the extent not expressly
prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC or any  other Governmental Entity or Person,
give the other party the opportunity to  attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences, in each case, regarding  any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties hereto may, as each  deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive  material
provided to the other under this Section 5.4 as "Outside Counsel  Only". Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given  only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed  by  such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless 
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials 
(the  Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, materials
provided to the other  party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the  valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to  the  contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement will require  or  obligate Parent or any of its
Affiliates to (and in no event shall any  representation, warranty or
covenant of Parent contained in this Agreement  be  breached or deemed
breached as a result of the failure of Parent to take any  of  the following
actions) (i) agree to or otherwise become subject to any  limitations on (A)
the right of Parent effectively to control or operate its  business
(including the business of the Company  and its  Subsidiaries) or assets
(including, except as and to the extent provided in  the  last parenthetical
in clause (ii), the assets of the Company  and its  Subsidiaries), (B) the
right of Parent to consummate the Merger, or (C) the  right of Parent to

of the Company  and its  Subsidiaries), or (ii) agree or be required to
sell, license or otherwise  dispose of, hold (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise), or divest  itself of, or limit its rights in, all or any
portion of the business, assets  or  operations of Parent or any of its
Affiliates or the business of the Company  and  its Subsidiaries or any of
the assets of the Company  and its  Subsidiaries (other than a portion of
the business or assets of the Company  and  its Subsidiaries that is not, in
the aggregate, material to the Company and  its  Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).

 

 

Section  5.5. _Acquisition  Proposals_.

 

 

(a) Until  this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1,
the Company  shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates to, and  shall  cause its officers, directors, employees,

the " **Representatives** "),  not  to, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit
or initiate the making of, or take  any  other action to knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal  that constitutes or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition  Proposal (including,
without limitation, taking any action to make the  provisions of any
"moratorium", "control share", "fair price", "affiliate  transaction",
"business combination" or other antitakeover laws and regulations  of any
state, including, without limitation, the provisions of Article 14 and 
Article 14.1 of the VSCA inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an

negotiations  with, or furnish or disclose any nonpublic information to, any
Person (other  than Parent or any of its Representatives) in connection with

(4) approve or  recommend, or publicly announce it is considering approving
or recommending,  any  Acquisition Proposal or (5) enter into any agreement,
letter of intent,  agreement-in-principle or acquisition agreement relating
to any Acquisition  Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to the time that  the  Company Requisite Shareholder Vote is obtained,
the Company and its  Representatives may:

 

 

(i) participate  in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose
nonpublic  information to, any Person or any Person's Representatives in
response to an  unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_   and  written Acquisition
Proposal that is submitted to the Company by such Person  after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the time that the Company  Requisite Shareholder
Vote is obtained if and so long as (A) none of the  Company, any of its
Affiliates or any of the Representatives of the Company  or  any of its
Affiliates has solicited such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise  violated any
of the provisions of Section 5.5(a)(1) through (5) with respect  to  such
Acquisition Proposal, (B) a majority of the members of the Board of 
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with 
a  nationally recognized financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal 
constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) 
a  majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company
determines  in  good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failing  to  take such action would be inconsistent with their
fiduciary duties to the  Company and the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law (including, without  limitation, their obligations under VSCA
§13.1-690A), (D) prior to participating  in discussions or negotiations with,
or furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic  information to, such Person, the
Company provides Parent with written notice  of  the identity of such Person
and of the Company's intention to participate in  discussions or negotiations
with, or to furnish or disclose nonpublic  information to, such Person, (E)
prior to participating in discussions or  negotiations with, or furnishing or
disclosing any nonpublic information to,  such Person, the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality  agreement containing terms no
less restrictive upon such Person, in any respect,  than the terms applicable
to Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement, which  confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such Person with any exclusive  right  to
negotiate with the Company or have the effect of prohibiting the Company 
from  satisfying its obligations under this Agreement, and (F) prior to
furnishing  or  disclosing any nonpublic information to such Person, the
Company furnishes  such  information to Parent (to the extent such
information has not been previously  delivered or made available by the
Company to Parent);


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-33-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) approve  or recommend, or enter into (and, in connection therewith,
effect a Change  in  the Company Recommendation), a definitive agreement
with respect to an  unsolicited, _bona_ _fide_   written  Acquisition
Proposal that is submitted to the Company after the date of this  Agreement
and prior to the time that the Company Requisite Shareholder Vote  is 
obtained if and so long as (A) none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or 
any  of the Representatives of the Company or any of its Affiliates has
solicited  such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise violated any of the
provisions of this  Section 5.5, (B) the Company provides Parent with written
notice indicating  that  the Company, acting in good faith, believes that
the Acquisition Proposal is  reasonably likely to constitute a Superior
Proposal, (C) during the three  Business Day period after the Company
provides Parent with the written notice  described in clause (B) above, the
Company shall cause its financial and legal  advisors to negotiate in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes  to  negotiate) in an effort
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions  of  this Agreement
such that the Acquisition Proposal would not constitute a  Superior Proposal
(it is understood and agreed that, in the event such  Acquisition Proposal
does not constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into  account such
negotiations and adjustments, the Company would then proceed with  the
transactions contemplated hereby on such adjusted terms), (D) 
notwithstanding the negotiations and adjustments pursuant to clause (C)
above  but after taking into account the results of such negotiations and
adjustments,  the Board of Directors of the Company makes the determination
necessary for  such  Acquisition Proposal to constitute a Superior Proposal
at least three Business  Days after the Company provides Parent with the
written notice referred to  in  clause (B) above, (E) notwithstanding the
negotiations and adjustments pursuant  to clause (C) above but after taking
into account the results of such  negotiations and adjustments, at least
three Business Days after the Company  provides Parent with the written
notice referred to in clause (B) above, a  majority of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company determine  in  good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing  to  approve or
recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such 
Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties to
the  Company and the Company's shareholders under applicable Law (including,
without  limitation, their obligations under VSCA §13.1-690A) and that such
Acquisition  Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and (F) not later than the
earlier of  the  approval or recommendation of, or the execution and
delivery of a definitive  agreement with respect to, any such Superior
Proposal, the Company (I)  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(h) and (II) makes the payment  of the Termination Fee and the Termination
Expenses required to be made pursuant  to Section 7.2(b); and

 

 

(iii) effect  a  change in the Company Recommendation (other than in
connection with an  Acquisition Proposal) prior to the time that the Company
Requisite Shareholder  Vote is obtained if a majority of the members of the
Board of Directors of  the  Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal  counsel, that failure to do so would
constitute a breach of their fiduciary  duties to the Company and the
Company's shareholders under applicable Law  (including, without limitation,
their obligations under VSCA §13.1-690A).

 

 

(b) In  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section
5.5(a), within  one Business Day of the receipt thereof, the Company shall
provide Parent with  written


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-34-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice  of  (i) any request for information, any Acquisition Proposal or any

Acquisition Proposal,  (ii) the material terms and conditions of such

Acquisition Proposal or such request, inquiry or proposal  or with whom such
discussions or negotiations are taking place, and the Company  shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of any material written materials  received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing. The Company  shall keep
Parent informed of the status and general progress (including  amendments or
proposed amendments to any material terms) of any such request  or 
Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent informed as to the material details of 
any  information requested of or provided by the Company and as to the
material  details of all discussions or negotiations. Without limiting the
Company's  obligations under Section 5.5(a), the Company shall provide Parent
with notice  prior to any meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company at
which the  Board  of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any
material action with respect  to an Acquisition Proposal that is on the
agenda for such meeting.

 

 

(c) The  Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the
Representatives of the  Company and its Affiliates to, immediately cease all
discussions or  negotiations, if any, with any Person other than Parent and
its Subsidiaries  that may be ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to any  Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request each
Person who has  heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its  consideration of acquiring the Company or any portion thereof
(including any  of  its Subsidiaries) to return or destroy all nonpublic
information heretofore  furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company.

 

 

(d) Nothing  contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit the Company from
complying with  Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with respect to  an  Acquisition Proposal, provided that such Rules shall in
no way eliminate or  modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have  under this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Any  violation of this Section 5.5 by the Company's Affiliates or the
Representatives  of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company,  whether or not such Affiliate or Representative is
authorized to act and whether  or not such Affiliate or Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of the  Company.

 

 

Section  5.6. _Indemnification;  Directors and Officers Insurance_. 

 

 

(a) Parent  shall cause all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities  for  acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including, but  not limited to, any acts or omissions in connection
with this Agreement and  the  consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) now existing in favor  of  any current and former officers,
directors and employees of the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries, and any
Person prior to the Effective Time serving at  the  request of any such
party as a director, officer, employee fiduciary or agent  of  another
corporation, partnership, trust or other enterprise, as provided in  the 
respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable  organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " **Indemnified  Persons** "),  to  survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance  with their terms
for a period of six years after the Effective Time. Parent  shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-35-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

Corporation  to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six years
from the  Effective Time, the Indemnified Persons an insurance policy that
provides  coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including,  but  not limited to, any acts or omissions in connection with
this Agreement and  the  consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) (the " **D andO  Insurance**")  on the  same terms as the Company's
existing policy or, if such insurance coverage is  unavailable, coverage that
is on terms no less favorable to such directors  and  officers; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay an annual  premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 200% of
the last annual premium  that the Company paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. In lieu of Parent  causing the Surviving Corporation to maintain
the policies as described above,  Parent may elect to cause the Company to
purchase immediately prior to the  Effective Time a six-year "tail" pre-paid
policy on terms and conditions not  materially less favorable than the
current directors' and officers' liability  insurance policies (but not, in
any event, to exceed in cost the present value  of the aggregate amount
required to be paid for the DandO Insurance pursuant  to the proviso in the
immediately preceding sentence), such policy to be  effective as of the
Effective Time.

 

 

(b) The  provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger  for  a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit
each of the  Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and
representatives; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the event that any
claim or claims for indemnification set forth in this Section  5.6 are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to  indemnification
in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until  disposition of
any and all such claims. If Parent and/or Surviving Corporation,  or any of
their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or  merges into
any other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially  all of
their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case,  to
the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the
successors  and assigns of Parent and/or Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall  assume the obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation set
forth in this  Section 5.6.

 

 

Section  5.7. _Public  Announcements_.  Neither  Parent nor the Company,
other than on a conference call with analysts and other  investors, shall
issue  any press release or otherwise make any public statement with respect
to the  transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
the other,  unless Parent or the Company (as the case may be) determines that
the issuance  of such press release or the making of such other public
statement be  required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
applicable listing  agreement with any national securities exchange.

 

 

Section  5.8. _Section  16 Matters_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions that are required  to  cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (and derivative securities with  respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated  by  Article 1 by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of  Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt  under 
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 

Section  5.9. _State  Takeover Laws_.  If any "moratorium", "control
share", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business  combination" or
similar Law shall become applicable to the transactions  contemplated hereby,
then the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company  shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals  and  take such
actions as


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-36-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as  promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act  to  minimize the effects of any such statute or similar Law
on the transactions  contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section  5.10. _Notification  of Certain Matters_.  Parent  shall use its
reasonable best efforts to give prompt written notice to the  Company, and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt  written
notice to Parent, of: (a) any  representation or warranty made by such party
in this Agreement that is  inaccurate in any material respect as of the date
of this Agreement (or any  representation or warranty made by such party in
this Agreement that is  qualified by materiality or refers to Material
Adverse Effect that is inaccurate  in any respect as of the date of this
Agreement),  the  occurrence or non-occurrence of any event of which the
Company is aware that  would be reasonably likely to cause the condition
precedent in Section 6.2(a)  not to be satisfied or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event of which  Parent is aware that would be reasonably
likely to cause the condition precedent  in Section 6.3(a) not to be
satisfied; or (b) any failure in any material  respect of such party to
comply in a timely manner with or satisfy any covenant  or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;  _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.10
shall not limit or  otherwise affect the remedies available under this
Agreement to the party  receiving such notice; and provided further that no
party shall have the right  not to close the Merger or the right to terminate
this Agreement as a result  of  the delivery of such a notice if the
underlying breach would not result in  such  party having such rights under
the terms of Articles 6 and 7  hereof.

 

 

Section  5.11. _Certain  Litigation_.  The  Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or  settlement of any litigation
against the Company or its officers or directors  relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall not agree  to  any
compromise or settlement of such litigation without Parent's  consent.

 

 

Section  5.12. _Confidentiality_.  Each of  the Company and Parent
acknowledges and confirms that (a) the Company and Parent  have entered into
a Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 15, 2006 (the  "
**Confidentiality  Agreement** "),  (b)  all information provided by each
party hereto to the other party hereto pursuant  to this Agreement is subject

Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in  accordance with its terms
and conditions.

 

 

Section  5.13. _Resignations_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause each member of the Board of  Directors of the Company to execute
and deliver a letter, which shall not be  revoked or amended prior to the
Effective Time, effectuating his or her  resignation as a director of the
Company effective immediately prior to the  Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall obtain the  resignations of such directors
of its Subsidiaries as Parent shall request  with  reasonable advance
notice.

 

 

Section  5.14. _Financing_.  During  the period commencing on the date of
this Agreement and continuing until the  Effective Time, the Company shall
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries  to  provide, all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with  the  arrangement of the
Financing (or any replacements thereof), including: (a)  participation in due
diligence sessions, meetings, drafting sessions,  management presentation
sessions, "road


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-37-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows",  and sessions with rating agencies by the Company's officers and
employees; (b)  assisting Parent in obtaining any title insurance lien
waivers, estoppels,  affidavits, non-disturbance agreements, memoranda of
leases, legal opinions,  surveys or other documents or deliveries; and (c)
using commercially reasonable  efforts to prepare business projections,
financial statements, pro forma  statements and other financial data of the
type and form consistently included  in offering memoranda, private placement
memoranda, prospectuses and similar  documents, all as may be reasonably
requested by Parent. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to execute  any agreements prior to the
Closing unless such agreements shall only be  effective upon the Closing,
(ii) counsel for the Company shall not be required  to deliver any legal
opinions, (iii) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries  shall be required to
pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other  liability in
connection with any debt financing by Parent prior to the Closing  and (iv)
all obligations in this Section 5.14 shall be subject to applicable  laws
relating to exchange of information and attorney-client communication  and 
privileges.

 

 

Section  5.15. _Employee  Matters_.

 

 

(a) Parent  agrees that, until the end of any applicable plan year in which
the Closing  Date  occurs, non-union employees of the Company who continue
their employment with  the Surviving Corporation or other Affiliate of Parent
(the " **Continuing  Employees** ")  shall,  at the sole discretion of
Parent, either continue to be eligible to participate  in Employee Benefit
Plans (other than equity award plans and any unwritten  severance policies or
agreements), with such changes to any such Employee  Benefit Plan as Parent
in its sole discretion may determine, _provided_   that  following any such
change the benefits under any such Employee Benefit Plan  shall be the same
benefits provided under a Parent Plan, or alternatively shall  be eligible to
participate, in the same manner as similarly situated employees  employed by
Parent or its Affiliates, in corresponding employee benefit plans  sponsored
or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable (the " **Parent 
Plans** "),  it  being understood and agreed that Parent may make the
foregoing determination  in  its sole discretion and on a plan-by-plan
basis.

 

 

(b) For  purposes of vesting  and eligibility but not for purposes of
benefit accrual (other than determining  the amount of vacation and severance
benefits) under  each Parent Plan in which Continuing Employees become
eligible to participate  after the Closing Date, such participating
Continuing Employee will be credited  with his or her years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries (and  their respective predecessors) to 
the  same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing
Date,  to credit for such service under any similar Employee Benefit Plan,
except  to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits 
or is  prohibited under applicable Law.  With respect to Parent Plans that
are welfare plans (the **" Parent  Welfare Plans"**)  in which Continuing
Employees participate after the Closing Date, Parent shall,  except  to 
the extent prohibited under applicable law, (1)  waive all limitations under
such plans as to preexisting conditions and  exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable  to  such employees to
the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied  or  did not apply
to such employees under Employee Benefit Plans prior to the  Closing Date,
and (2) provide each Continuing Employee who participates in  such  Parent
Welfare Plans with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior  to
the Closing Date and during the plan year of the Parent Welfare Plan in 
which  the


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-38-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Closing  Date occurs in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements  to the extent applicable under any such plan.

 

 

(c) Nothing  contained herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to
establish,  amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; (ii) shall  alter or limit the ability of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify  or  terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time  assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them; (iii) is intended  to confer upon any current or
former employee any right to employment or  continued employment for any
period of time by reason of this Agreement, or  any  right to a particular
term or condition of employment; or (iv) is intended  to  confer upon any
Person (including employees, retirees, or dependents or  beneficiaries of
employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary  of this
Agreement.

 

 

(d) Upon  the  Effective Time, Parent shall assume and perform, or shall
cause the Surviving  Corporation to assume and perform, the obligations under
the Retention  Agreements listed in _Schedule  3.14(a)(7)(a)-(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ ,  in the  same manner and to the same extent
the Company would be required to perform  if  the succession contemplated by
this Agreement had not taken place.

 

 

Section  5.16. _Consent  Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) In  the  event that, following the date of this Agreement, Parent or any
of its  Subsidiaries shall, in its sole discretion, (x) solicit (at its
expense) the  consent (the **" Consent  Solicitation"**)  of the  holders
of the Company's 8 3/8%  Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the  **"
Senior  Subordinated Notes"**)  in  order to effect one or more amendments
determined by Parent, in its sole  discretion (the **" Indenture 
Amendments"**),  to the  Indenture dated as of June 15, 2004, among the
Company, each of the Guarantors  (as defined therein) and Wachovia Bank,
National Association, as trustee, as  amended to date (the **"
Indenture"**),  to be  effective immediately prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, as determined  by  Parent in its sole discretion, and/or (y)
offer (at its expense) to purchase  (the **" Offer  to Purchase"**)  the 
Senior Subordinated Notes, Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each 
other with respect to the Consent Solicitation or the Offer to Purchase (as 
applicable) and the preparation, form and content of the solicitation and
offer  materials (as applicable) to be distributed to the holders of the
Senior  Subordinated Notes.

 

 

(b) Promptly  upon receipt of the consent of the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal  amount of the then outstanding Senior Subordinated
Notes, the Company shall,  and  shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the trustee under the  Indenture to, execute a supplemental
indenture incorporating the Indenture  Amendments; _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  such supplemental indenture shall only become effective immediately
prior to,  at  or after the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.16,
prior to the Effective  Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
will be required to pay  any fees or out-of-pocket expenses or otherwise give
any consideration to a  third party in connection with the Consent
Solicitation or the Offer to  Purchase.

representations, by or among  the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof.

 

 

(b) Except  for the rights of the Company's shareholders to receive the
Merger Consideration  on or after the Effective Time and the right of the
Company, on behalf of its  shareholders, to pursue damages in the event the

this Agreement and except for the  provisions of Section 5.6
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance),  this Agreement is not

hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 

Section  8.5. _Assignment;  Binding Effect_.  No  party hereto may assign
this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or  obligations hereunder
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the  prior written
approval of the other parties hereto, and any attempted assignment  without

_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Merger Sub may assign its rights hereunder

accordance  with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia that apply to
Contracts made  and  performed entirely within such State. Each party hereto
agrees that any  dispute or disagreement between or among any of the parties
hereto as to the  interpretation of any provision of, or the performance of
obligations under,  this Agreement shall be commenced and prosecuted in its
entirety solely  in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York  and any reviewing appellate court thereof. If the
United States District Court  for the Southern District of New York, or any
reviewing appellate court  thereof, finds that it does not have jurisdiction
over the dispute or  disagreement, then and only then can the parties proceed
in state court and  the parties hereby agree that any such dispute will only
be brought in state  court in New York County, New York. Each party hereto
consents to personal  and  subject matter jurisdiction and venue in such New

legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is  not  affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such  determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable  of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify  this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely  as 
possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated
hereby  are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent 
possible.

 

 

Section  8.8. _Enforcement  of Agreement_.  The  parties agree that money
damages or any other remedy at law would not be a  sufficient or adequate

be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to an  injunction
restraining such actual or threatened breach, violation or default  and to
