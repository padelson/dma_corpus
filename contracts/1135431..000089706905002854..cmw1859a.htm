 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 5, 2005 (the " _Agreement_ "), among Fresh Brands, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (the " _Company_ "), Certified Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Pillow Acquisition Corp., a Wisconsin corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Acquisition Sub_ "). 

   

W I T N E S S E T H:

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and Company have each unanimously approved this Agreement and the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") has unanimously determined that the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, is fair and in the best interests of its shareholders and has unanimously resolved to recommend, subject to the terms of this Agreement, that the holders of the shares of Companys issued and outstanding common stock, $0.05 par value per share _("Common Stock_ "), approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition Sub and Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and 

   

 WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in _Section 7.16_. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Acquisition Sub and Company hereby agree as follows: 

   

# ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

   

 Section 1.01. _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time in accordance with the WBCL, Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into Company. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger hereinafter sometimes is referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_." 

    

 Section 1.02. _Closing; Effective Time_. 

    

 (a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in  _Article V_, at the offices of Sonnenschein Nath and Rosenthal LLP, 8000 Sears Tower, 233 S. Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing between Parent and Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

    

 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall file a plan of merger (the " _Plan of Merger_ "), in accordance with Section 180.1101 of the WBCL, with the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin (the " _WDFI_ "), in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the WBCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Plan of Merger (the time of such filing (or such later time as is specified in such Plan of Merger as agreed between Parent and Company) being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

        

* * *

     

 Section 1.03. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the WBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Acquisition Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all Liabilities and duties of Company and Acquisition Sub shall become the Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

    

 Section 1.04. _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of Company or Acquisition Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either Company or Acquisition Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. 

    

 Section 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation; By-Laws; Directors and Officers_. 

    

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read in the form of the Articles of Incorporation of the Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by applicable Laws and this Agreement, except that, as of the Effective Time, Article I of such Articles of Incorporation shall be amended to reflect the name of the Surviving Corporation designated by Parent. 

    

 (b) At the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately  prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation  until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Articles of Incorporation of  the Surviving Corporation and such By-Laws. 

    

 (c) The directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be as designated in writing by Parent prior to the Effective Time, in each case until their successors are duly elected or  appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

      Section 1.06. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquisition Sub, Company or the holder of any of the following securities: 

    

 (a) Each share of Common Stock (a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be canceled  pursuant to _Section 1.06(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be  canceled and be converted into the right to receive $7.05 in cash payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the _"Merger Consideration_ "),  upon surrender of the certificate representing such Share, less any withholding  taxes. From and after the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be  outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to  exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor, without interest, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.08. 

    

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of Company or owned by any Subsidiary and each Share owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and no payment or other consideration shall be made with respect thereto. 

    

 (c) Each share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of Acquisition Sub issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and  thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (except as otherwise provided in Section 180.0622(2)(b) of the WBCL, as judicially  interpreted) share of common stock, $0.05 par value per share, of the Surviving  Corporation. 

    

 Section 1.07. _Dissenting Shares_. 

    

 (a) It is anticipated that on the record date fixed for purposes of determining the  holders of Shares entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, a meeting to  approve the Plan of Merger, the Shares will continue to be quoted on Nasdaq.  Accordingly, subject to such continued quotation, holders of Shares will not  have dissenters rights under Section 180.1301 _et seq._ of the  WBCL in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Sections  1.07(b) and (c)_ below shall apply in the event that holders of Shares do  have dissenters rights under Section 180.1301 _et seq._ of the  WBCL, whether because the Shares no longer are quoted on Nasdaq on such record  date or otherwise. 

    

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by any record holder who has not voted to approve the Plan of Merger or consented thereto in writing and is otherwise entitled to demand, and who has properly exercised, preserved and perfected dissenters rights in accordance with Section 180.1301 _et seq._ of the WBCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall instead become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the WBCL; _provided, however_ , that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost his dissenters rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the WBCL, shall forfeit his dissenters rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without interest, upon surrender of the certificates representing such Shares in accordance with _Section 1.08_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 1.07(b)_ , if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares shall terminate. 

      (c) Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any notices of intent to demand payment, any withdrawals of such notices received by Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to Section 180.1301 _et seq._ of the WBCL and received by Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment under Section 180.1301 _et seq._ of the WBCL. Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

    

 Section 1.08. _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_. 

    

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company  reasonably acceptable to Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the  " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the funds necessary to make the  payments contemplated by _Section 1.06(a)_. Parent shall, at or prior  to the Effective Time, make available or cause to be made available to the  Paying Agent cash in amounts necessary for the payment of the Merger  Consideration under _Section 1.08(b)_ to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 1.06(a)_. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent. Any net  profits resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments  shall be payable as directed by Parent. 

    

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or  certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares  (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration as  provided in _Section 1.06(a)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for  cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be  appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,  and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the  holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be  canceled. 

    

 (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of canceled Shares is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate so  surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for  transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any  transfer and other taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have  established to the satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent that such tax  either has been paid or is not payable. If a mutilated Certificate is  surrendered to the Paying Agent or if the holder of a Certificate submits an  affidavit to the Paying Agent stating that the Certificate has been lost,  destroyed or wrongfully taken, such holder shall, if required by Parent, furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the reasonable judgment of Parent to protect Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 1.08_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this _Section 1.08_, without interest thereon. 

     (d) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and Certificates representing Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.06(b)_) shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) and only as general creditors thereof, with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by such holder, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates have not been surrendered prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

    

 (e) Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent or the Paying Agent. 

    

 (f) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore  represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer  books of Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall not be any further  registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time on the records of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the  Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for  transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as  provided in _Section 1.06(a)_ and this _Section 1.08_. 

    

 Section 1.09. _Stock Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, the Stock Option Committee thereof) of Company shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary to cause each holder of an issued and outstanding option or similar right to purchase Common Stock, whether or not then vested or exercisable (an " _Option_ ") pursuant to any stock option or similar plans, agreements or arrangements of Company including any related award agreements (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), to enter into an Option Cancellation Agreement, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (an " _Option Cancellation Agreement_ "), pursuant to which such holder will agree to cancellation of his or her Options immediately prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the consideration provided therein, net of such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of that Option for all purposes under this Agreement. Company shall take all action to ensure that all Stock Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of Company or any Subsidiary, shall automatically terminate as of the Effective Time, and that any holder of issued and outstanding awards thereunder will have no rights other than the right to receive the payment in cancellation and settlement thereof as provided in the Option Cancellation Agreements. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors, or the Stock Option Committee thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC to approve the disposition by any officer or director of Company who is a covered person of Company for purposes of Section 16 under the Exchange Act of Shares or Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger for purposes of qualifying the disposition as an exempt transaction under Section 16 under the Exchange Act.

The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized and approved by the respective boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition Sub. No other or further corporate act or proceeding on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub or their respective shareholders is necessary to authorize or approve this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against them in accordance with their respective terms, except as such may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting creditors rights generally, and by general equitable principles. 

    

 Section 2.03. _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the Transactions contemplated hereby (a) assuming all notices, reports or other filings described in this _Section 2.03_ have been given or made, will violate any Laws or Orders of any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent or Acquisition Sub, (b) except for (i) the filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, (ii) if applicable, the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) the filing of the Plan of Merger as required by the WBCL, (iv) filings as may be required by any applicable state takeover or "blue sky" Laws and (v) filings as would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger, will require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or other action by or notice to any Governmental Entity or (c) subject to obtaining the consents described in clause (b) above, will violate or conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or will result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, any term or provision of the charter, bylaws or similar organizational documents of Parent or Acquisition Sub or of any Contract to which Parent or Acquisition Sub is a party or by which Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of its assets or properties may be bound or affected, except for, in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (c) above, any such items which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

      Section 2.04. _Brokers_. No broker, finder, financial advisor or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial advisors or other fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub.

None of the information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement (the " _Parent Information_ ") will, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to shareholders or at the time of Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

    

 Section 2.06. _Financing_. At the Effective Time, Parent will have, and will make available to Acquisition Sub, the funds necessary to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to pay related fees and expenses, subject to satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in Section 5.02(g) of this Agreement.

# ARTICLE III  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

   

 Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure schedules to this Agreement, Company represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub as set forth below. Each exception set forth in the disclosure schedule is identified by reference to, or has been grouped under a heading referring to, a specific individual section or subsection of this Agreement and, except where specifically cross-referenced to another section or subsection, relates only to such section or subsection; _provided, however_ , that any information which is fairly described with reasonable particularity and detail under any section number shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated in any other section of the disclosure schedule where such disclosure would be appropriate and readily apparent. 

   

 Section 3.01. _Corporate_. (a) (a) Each of Company and the Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (which, in the case of a corporation organized under the Laws of the State of Wisconsin, means that such corporation has filed its most recent required annual report and has not filed articles of dissolution) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (ii)(a) has all requisite corporate power and authority and (b) any necessary governmental authority and approvals, to own, operate or lease the properties that it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its Business as it is now being conducted, and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except, in the case of subsections (ii)(b) and (iii) hereof, for any such failures that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of Company and each Subsidiary. Neither Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision or its articles of organization or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents).

Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any of the Representatives, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and  whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Company or  any Affiliate or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 4.02  by Company. 

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 4.02_ shall not prohibit Company or the Representatives from: 

        | (i) participating in any discussions or

limitation, any Person with whom Company was in  discussions regarding a
potential Acquisition Proposal prior to the date hereof) or, in connection
with any such Acquisition Proposal, furnishing or providing access to any
Person to properties, books and records or any nonpublic information or data
with respect to Company or any of its Affiliates, in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to

Representatives shall have violated any of the provisions of this _Section
4.02_ , and (B) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized
financial advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor), (x) that
such Person is reasonably capable of consummating such Acquisition Proposal
taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
such Acquisition Proposal and (y) that such Acquisition Proposal will result
in, or could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in, a Superior
Proposal from the party that made the applicable Acquisition  Proposal (or
such partys Affiliates), and (C) the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally
recognized financial advisor (which may be the Companys Financial Advisor),

of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to Companys shareholders
under applicable Law, and (D) within one Business Day following any
determination by the Board of Directors referred to in clauses (B) or (C)

Company gives Parent written notice of Companys intention to participate
in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose
nonpublic information to, such Person, and (E) in each such case, the Board
of Directors has received from the Person being furnished or disclosed
any nonpublic information, an executed confidentiality agreement (the
subject matter of which shall be limited to the protection of nonpublic 
information or standstill provisions) on terms no less favorable to Company
in any material respect than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall in no event provide such
Person with any exclusive right to negotiate with Company or have the effect
of prohibiting Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement,
and (F) simultaneous with or prior to furnishing or disclosing any nonpublic
information to such Person, Company furnishes such information to Parent (to
the extent such information has not been previously delivered or made
available by Company to Parent); or    
---|--- 
   
     into, a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited, bona fide and
written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted  to Company after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the adoption of this Agreement by Companys
shareholders in accordance with this Agreement if and only if (A) none of
Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the Representatives have violated
any of the provisions of this  _Section 4.02_ , and (B) the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor (which may be
Companys Financial Advisor), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal and
that the termination of this Agreement to accept such Superior Proposal
and/or the recommendation of such Superior Proposal to the shareholders of
Company is reasonably necessary in order for the Board of Directors to comply
with its fiduciary duties to Companys shareholders under applicable Law, 
_provided,_ _however_ , that Company shall not have the right to take any
such action or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.01(d)(ii)
hereof and the Board of Directors shall not recommend a  Superior Proposal to
Companys shareholders pursuant to this Section 4.02, and any purported
termination pursuant to Section 6.01(d)(ii) hereof shall be void and of no
force or effect, unless prior to any such termination (1) Company has
provided Parent with written notice that it intends to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.01(d)(ii) hereof and take such action with
respect to a Superior Proposal, such notice to specify in reasonable detail
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal then determined to
be more favorable, the parties thereto, and shall be accompanied by a copy of
the proposed acquisition agreement for such Superior Proposal and any
ancillary agreements each in substantially the form to be entered into, such
notice and documents to be delivered not less than three full Business Days
prior to the time the action is to be taken; and (2) during the three full
Business Day period following the delivery of the notice referred to in
clause (1) above,  Parent shall have the right to propose adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and Company and its advisors shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent in an effort to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following any
such negotiations and adjustments pursuant to clause (2) above, the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor (which
may be Companys Financial Advisor), that such proposal is a
Superior Proposal and that the termination of this Agreement to accept
such Superior Proposal and/or the recommendation of such Superior Proposal
to the shareholders of Company is reasonably necessary in order for the
Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to Companys 
shareholders under applicable Law, (4) at least three full Business
Days after Parent receives the written notice from Company referred to
in clause (1) above, Company delivers to Parent (a) a written notice
of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.01(d)(ii), and (b)
a wire transfer of immediately available funds in the amount of
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 6.03(b); and (5) Company does
not approve or recommend or enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal at any time before Parent receives the
written notice from Company and payment of the Termination Fee referred to
in clause (4) above. Any withdrawal, modification or amendment of
the recommendation of the Board of Directors, or any approval or 
recommendation or proposed approval or recommendation of any
Superior Proposal or the entry by Company into any agreement with respect to
any Superior Proposal shall not change the approval of the Board of
Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state
law to be inapplicable to the Transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger.

Company also shall, if it has not already done so, request within three Business Days of the date of this Agreement, to the extent it has a contractual right to do so, that each Person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information or data heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

    

 (d) Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt of an  Acquisition Proposal) notify Parent orally and confirm in writing if any  proposals are received by, any information is requested from, or any  negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with,  Company or its Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition  Proposal or the possibility or consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal  (" _Acquisition Proposal Interest_ "), and such notice shall  indicate the name of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal Interest and  describe in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such  Acquisition Proposal Interest. Company agrees that it shall keep Parent  informed, on a current basis, of the status and material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal Interest. 

    

 (e) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer from any Person (in each case, whether or not in writing and whether or not delivered to the shareholders of Company generally) relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of at least a 10% portion of the assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of over 10% of any class of equity securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer involving any class of equity securities of Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination,  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) any other transaction, the  consummation of which would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with,  prevent or materially delay the Merger, or (v) any other transaction similar to  any of the foregoing with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case other than any Transactions to be effected pursuant to this Agreement. " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by any Person to acquire all of the issued and outstanding Shares pursuant to a tender offer or a merger or to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of Company and the Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, that is (x) reasonably capable of being consummated and (y) would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to Companys shareholders, from a financial point of view, than the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account the nature of the currency and all legal, financial, regulatory, and similar aspects of, and conditions to, the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and provisions of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal, including taking into account the nature of the currency and all legal, financial, regulatory, and similar aspects of, and conditions to, the adjustments).

     Section 4.03. _Access to Information_. 

    

 (a) Subject to applicable Law, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of the Closing Date and the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 6.01_ , Company shall, and shall cause each of Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice, afford Parent and Acquisition Sub, and their respective authorized Representatives, reasonable access during  normal business hours to the employees, assets, properties, contracts, books and records of Company and Subsidiaries so that they may have the opportunity to make such investigations as they shall desire of the affairs of Company and  Subsidiaries; _provided, however,_ that such investigation shall not affect the representations and warranties made by Company in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any information that would cause a violation of Law or any confidentiality agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement or waive any attorney-client privilege (in which case the parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, if such arrangements can be made by the parties using their reasonable best efforts and, if material to Company, without such violation or waiver); _provided further_ , that all requests for such access, inspection or information pursuant to this _Section 4.03_ shall be made through Companys Chief Operating Officer or such other person as he shall designate in writing to Parent.

The only shareholder vote required for approval of the Merger and this Agreement shall be the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares. No other vote of the holders of any class or series of the capital stock of Company is necessary to approve any of the other transactions contemplated hereby. Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from shareholders of Company proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all other reasonable action necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, advisable to secure any vote of shareholders required by the WBCL to effect the Merger; _provided, however_ , that subject to the terms of this Agreement (including Sections 6.01(c)(ii) and 6.03(b) hereof), the Board of Directors may withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation if the Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a nationally recognized financial advisor (which may be Companys Financial Advisor), that the taking of such action is reasonably necessary in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to Companys shareholders under applicable Law.

     (b) Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Parent of the receipt of any comments from or other correspondence with the SEC staff with respect to the  Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the Proxy  Statement or for additional information (and promptly deliver a copy of such  comments, correspondence or request to Parent). Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with Parent, to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof.

For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent required and/or permitted by Article VIII of Companys By-Laws in effect on the date hereof, the present and former officers and directors (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of Company and its Subsidiaries against all Liabilities in respect of acts or omissions taken in their capacity as officers or directors of Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, including amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, unreasonably conditioned or unreasonably delayed). Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the WBCL, the Articles of Incorporation or Article VIII of Companys By-Laws in effect on the date hereof and the By-laws of Subsidiaries, in each case in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time in accordance with their terms and without amendment thereof in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of Company; _provided, however,_ that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under Article VIII of Companys By-Laws in effect on the date hereof, any other similar organizational documents of Company and Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall be made by in the manner provided in Article VIII of Companys By-Laws in effect on the date hereof; and _provided, further,_ that nothing in this _Section 4.10_ shall impair any rights of any Indemnified Party.

For six years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and Surviving Corporation will, without any lapse in coverage, provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person currently covered by Companys officers and directors liability insurance policies (each an " _Insured Party_ ") on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay more than $600,000 in the aggregate to acquire a six year tail insurance policy to satisfy the requirement set forth in this Section, and if the aggregate premiums for such insurance would otherwise exceed $600,000, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy or policies with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount, _provided, further,_ that if the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger and the continuing or surviving entity does not assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 4.10_ , or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 4.10_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to reimburse all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees for one counsel or law firm, incurred by any Person to enforce the obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation under this _Section 4.10_. Company shall cooperate with Parent and its insurance broker in connection with the provision of information relating to the analysis of, and application for, insurance responsive to the requirements of this Section.

Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date hereof against Company or any of its directors by any shareholder of Company relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any other Transaction, without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, unreasonably conditioned or unreasonably delayed). 

    

 Section 4.12. _Director and Officer Resignations_. On the Closing Date, Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent duly executed resignations, effective as of the Effective Time, of each officer listed in _Schedule 4.12_ and each member of the Board of Directors of Company and each Subsidiary and shall take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
