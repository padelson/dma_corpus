<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          It
is anticipated that on the record date fixed for purposes of determining the
          holders of Shares entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, a meeting to
          approve the Plan of Merger, the Shares will continue to be quoted on Nasdaq.
          Accordingly, subject to such continued quotation, holders of Shares will not
          have dissenters&#146; rights under Section 180.1301 <I>et&nbsp;seq.</I> of the
          WBCL in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, <U>Sections

          have dissenters&#146; rights under Section 180.1301 <I>et&nbsp;seq.</I> of the
          WBCL, whether because the Shares no longer are quoted on Nasdaq on such record
          date or otherwise.  </FONT></P>

jurisdictions where required, which jurisdictions are set forth in <U>Schedule 3.14</U>.
All pending registrations and applications have been properly made and filed, and all

already have, except where the failure to have such Trade Rights would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All
Company Trade Rights are owned by Company or a Subsidiary, free and clear of all Liens
except Permitted Liens. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, neither Company nor any Subsidiary is
infringing or has infringed any Trade Rights of another and, to Company&#146;s Knowledge,
no person or entity is infringing or has infringed any of Company Trade Rights. There is

4.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Director and Officer Liability</U>. For a period of six years after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent required and/or permitted by Article VIII of Company&#146;s
By-Laws in effect on the date hereof, the present and former officers and directors (each
an &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) of Company and its Subsidiaries against all
Liabilities in respect of acts or omissions taken in their capacity as officers or
directors of Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the approval of Parent (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, unreasonably conditioned or unreasonably delayed).
Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties as provided in the WBCL, the Articles of Incorporation or Article
VIII of Company&#146;s By-Laws in effect on the date hereof and the By-laws of
Subsidiaries, in each case in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years after the Effective
Time in accordance with their terms and without amendment thereof in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who are or at any time prior
to the Effective Time were directors or officers of Company; <I>provided, however,</I> that
any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party&#146;s
conduct complies with the standards set forth under Article VIII of Company&#146;s
By-Laws in effect on the date hereof, any other similar organizational documents of
Company and Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall be made by in the manner provided in
Article VIII of Company&#146;s By-Laws in effect on the date hereof; and <I>provided,
further,</I> that nothing in this <U>Section 4.10</U> shall impair any rights of any
Indemnified Party. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the
event that any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any actual or threatened Litigation
covered by this <U>Section 4.10</U> after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent required and/or permitted by Article VIII
of Company&#146;s By-Laws in effect on the date hereof, promptly advance to such
Indemnified Party his or her legal or other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith); provided that any Person
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. For six years
after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and Surviving
Corporation will, without any lapse in coverage, provide officers&#146; and directors&#146; liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Person currently covered by Company&#146;s officers&#146; and directors&#146; liability
insurance policies (each an &#147;<U>Insured Party</U>&#148;) on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date
hereof; <I>provided, however</I>, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay more than $600,000 in the aggregate to acquire a six year
tail insurance policy to satisfy the requirement set forth in this Section, and if the
aggregate premiums for such insurance would otherwise exceed $600,000, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy or policies with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount, <I>provided, further,</I> that if the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger and the continuing or surviving entity does not assume
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this <U>Section 4.10</U>, or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this <U>Section 4.10</U>.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to reimburse all expenses, including
reasonable attorney&#146;s fees for one counsel or law firm, incurred by any Person to
enforce the obligations of Parent and Surviving Corporation under this <U>Section 4.10</U>.
Company shall cooperate with Parent and its insurance broker in connection with the
provision of information relating to the analysis of, and application for, insurance
responsive to the requirements of this Section.  </FONT></P>
