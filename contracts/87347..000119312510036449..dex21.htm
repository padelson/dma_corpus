vi AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of February 21,
2010, is by and among Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V.), a company
organized under the laws of the Netherlands Antilles ("Schlumberger"),
Turnberry Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Schlumberger ("Merger Sub"), and Smith International, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Smith").

RECITALS 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Smith, Schlumberger and Merger
Sub have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
companies and equity holders that Smith and Schlumberger engage in a business
combination whereby Schlumberger will acquire all of the outstanding capital
stock of Smith in exchange for shares of Schlumberger common stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the "Schlumberger Common Stock");

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of Smith,
Schlumberger and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable (1) this
Agreement and (2) the merger of Merger Sub with and into Smith (the "Merger")
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, Schlumberger and Smith intend that, for United States federal income
tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify (i) as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and (ii) for an exception to the general rule of Section
367(a)(1) of the Code; 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and their respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
Smith in accordance with this Agreement, and the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. Smith shall be the surviving entity in
the Merger (the "Surviving Entity"). The Merger shall have the effects
specified herein and in the DGCL.

Section 1.2 _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
(a) at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., One Shell Plaza, 910 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the first business
day or, if Schlumberger so elects, on the third business day, in each case
immediately following the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of
the conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be fulfilled at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment
or waiver of such conditions) shall be fulfilled or waived in 



 

1  accordance with this Agreement or (b) at such other time, date or place as
Schlumberger and Smith may agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Schlumberger, Merger Sub
and Smith shall cause a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
meeting the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL to be properly executed
and filed in accordance with such sections. The Merger shall become effective
at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later
time that Schlumberger and Smith shall have agreed upon and designated in
such filing as the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time").

ARTICLE 2

GOVERNING DOCUMENTS

Section 2.1 _Certificate of Incorporation_. As of the Effective Time, the

Surviving Entity, until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by
Applicable Law.

Section 2.2 _Bylaws_. As of the Effective Time, the bylaws of Smith, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Entity, until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by
Applicable Law.

ARTICLE 3

DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

or removal in accordance with the governing documents of the Surviving Entity.

Section 3.2 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of

2 ARTICLE 4

CONVERSION OF SMITH COMMON STOCK

Section 4.1 _Conversion of Equity Interests of Smith and Merger Sub._

(a) _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Smith ("Smith Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Smith Excluded Shares and Smith
Surviving Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive 0.6966 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Schlumberger Common Stock, subject to
adjustment in accordance with Section 4.3 (together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section
4.2(e), the "Merger Consideration").

(b) _Cancellation of Shares (other than Smith Excluded Shares and Smith
Surviving Shares)_. As a result of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Smith Common
Stock (other than Smith Excluded Shares and any Smith Surviving Shares) shall
cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any shares of Smith Common Stock (other than Smith Excluded
Shares and any Smith Surviving Shares) (the "Certificates") and each non-
certificated share represented by book entry ("Book Entry Share") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Smith Common Stock formerly represented thereby, and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 4.2(c). For purposes of this Agreement, "Smith Excluded
Shares" shall mean any shares of Smith Common Stock held by Schlumberger,
Smith or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Schlumberger, in
each case except for any such shares held on behalf of third parties. "Smith
Surviving Shares" shall mean any shares of Smith Common Stock held by any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Smith except for any such shares
held on behalf of third parties. 

(c) _Cancellation of Smith Excluded Shares_. Each Smith Excluded Share at the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor, and no Schlumberger
Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) _Survival of Smith Surviving Shares_. Each Smith Surviving Share at the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall continue to exist as a share
of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Entity
("Surviving Entity Common Stock") and shall not be canceled by virtue of
the Merger and no Schlumberger Common Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(e)  _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, the common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and 



 

3  without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
become a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Surviving Entity Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Smith Common
Stock converted into the Merger Consideration.

(f) _Smith Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all options to acquire
shares of Smith Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time under Smiths
stock plans (collectively, the "Smith Stock Plans", which are identified
in Section 4.1(f) of the Smith Disclosure Letter), including all options to
acquire shares of Smith Common Stock issued after the date hereof in
accordance with Section 7.1(b)(iv) (each, a "Smith Post-Signing Option",
and together with any other option to acquire shares of Smith Common Stock,
each a "Smith Option"), shall be converted automatically into an option (a
"Schlumberger Option") to acquire shares of Schlumberger Common Stock in
amounts and at an exercise price determined as provided in this Section 4.1(f)
(and otherwise subject to the terms of the Smith Stock Plans, as applicable,
under which they were issued and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder): (i) the number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to be
subject to a Schlumberger Option shall be equal to the product of the number
of shares of Smith Common Stock subject to the Smith Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time and the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional
shares of Schlumberger Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall
be rounded down to the nearest whole share and (ii) the exercise price per
share of Schlumberger Common Stock under a Schlumberger Option shall be equal
to the exercise price per share of Smith Common Stock under the original Smith
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio,
_provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. The duration and other terms of a Schlumberger Option shall be the same
as the original Smith Option from which it was converted except that all
references to "Smith" in such original Smith Option shall be deemed to be
references to Schlumberger; _provided, however_ , that all such Schlumberger
Options, other than those issued in respect of Smith Post-Signing Options,
will be fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time. 

(g) _Smith Stock Incentive Awards_. At the Effective Time, each restricted
stock unit and performance-based restricted stock unit award (collectively,
the "Smith Stock Incentive Awards") that is outstanding under any Smith Stock
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
earned, other than Smith Stock Incentive Awards granted after the date hereof
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iv) ("Smith Post-Signing Stock Incentive Awards"),
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration based on the total number of shares of Smith Common Stock
subject to such Smith Stock Incentive Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If the Smith Stock Incentive Award is a performance-based restricted
stock unit award, the total number of shares of Smith Common Stock subject to
such Smith Stock Incentive Award shall be calculated based on deemed
attainment of the performance goals under the award immediately prior to the
Effective Time assuming that the number of shares of Smith Common Stock
subject to each such Smith Stock Incentive Award is that number of shares
corresponding to 100% of the "Target Units" (as defined in the applicable
agreement representing such Smith Stock Incentive Awards). Smith shall make
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Schlumberger to satisfy all employment
and income tax withholding requirements with respect to each Smith Stock
Incentive Award that vests pursuant to this Section 4.1(g). Any Smith Post-
Signing Stock Incentive Awards shall be converted automatically into a stock
unit award (a "Schlumberger Stock Incentive Award") 



 

4  with respect to Schlumberger Common Stock in an amount equal to the product
of the number of shares of Smith Common Stock subject to the Smith Post-
Signing Stock Incentive Award immediately prior to the Effective Time and the
Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that any fractional shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole
share. The Schlumberger Stock Incentive Awards will be otherwise subject to
the terms of the Smith Stock Plans, as applicable, under which they were
issued and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder without any
acceleration of vesting or delivery, except that all references to "Smith"
in such original Smith Stock Incentive Award shall be deemed to be references
to Schlumberger.

Section 4.2  _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) _Exchange Fund_. As of the Effective Time, Schlumberger shall appoint
a commercial bank or trust company or such other party as is reasonably
satisfactory to Smith to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration
(the "Exchange Agent"). Schlumberger shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Smith Common Stock, the
number of shares of Schlumberger Common Stock that are issuable pursuant to
Section 4.1. Schlumberger shall deposit such shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock with the Exchange Agent by delivering to the Exchange Agent certificates
representing, or providing to the Exchange Agent an uncertificated book-entry
for, such shares. In addition, Schlumberger shall make available to the
Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to make payments
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(c). Any cash and shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock deposited by Schlumberger with the Exchange Agent
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

(b) _Exchange Rules._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Schlumberger shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
shares of Smith Common Stock as of the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Smith Common
Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of the corresponding Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" with
respect to Book Entry Shares, which letter shall be in customary form and have
such other provisions as Schlumberger may reasonably specify, and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates or Book Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of shares of
Smith Common Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, upon surrender of a Certificate or Book Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) one or more shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested and which shall represent, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (after taking into account all shares of
Smith Common Stock then held by such holder) and (ii) a check in the amount
equal to any cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article 4, consisting of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Schlumberger
Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any dividends and other 



 

5  distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(c). No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) or Section 4.2(e). In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Smith Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Smith, one or more shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of
shares of Schlumberger Common Stock and a check in the proper amount of any
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock pursuant to
Section 4.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c), may be issued with respect to such
Smith Common Stock, as the case may be, to such a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Smith Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made in respect of Schlumberger Common Stock shall
be paid to the holder of any shares of Smith Common Stock until the holder of
such shares shall surrender such shares in accordance with this Article 4.
Subject to Applicable Law, following surrender of any such shares,
there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Schlumberger Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends
or other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Schlumberger
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on
or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with
respect to such shares of Schlumberger Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time but on or prior to the date of such surrender and with a
payment date subsequent to such surrender.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Smith Common Stock._ All shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of
Smith Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article 4 (consisting
of any cash paid pursuant to Section 4.2(c) or Section 4.2(e)) shall be deemed
to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Smith Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
and/or Book Entry Shares.

(e) _No Fractional Shares of Schlumberger Common Stock_.

(i) No certificates or scrip or shares of Schlumberger Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock or book-entry
credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Schlumberger.

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Smith Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Schlumberger
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and/or Book Entry
Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in 



 

6  an amount equal to the product of (A) such fractional part of a share of
Schlumberger Common Stock multiplied by (B) the closing price for a share of
Schlumberger Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the
business day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

(iii) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Schlumberger, and Schlumberger shall deposit or cause
the Surviving Entity to deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall
cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares
as of the date six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Schlumberger or otherwise on the instruction of Schlumberger, and any holders
of the Certificates and/or Book Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to Schlumberger for
the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Smith Common Stock
formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to Section 4.1, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Schlumberger Common Stock
to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c). Any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Smith
Common Stock five years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of Schlumberger free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Schlumberger, Merger Sub, Smith, the Surviving
Entity, any affiliate of any of the foregoing or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(h) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Schlumberger on a daily
basis; _provided_ that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the stockholders of Smith pursuant to this Article 4 and that if at
any time prior to the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section
4.2(f), the amount of cash included in the Exchange Fund is reduced below the
amount necessary to pay any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Schlumberger
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e), and dividends and
distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c), Schlumberger shall promptly
deposit additional cash into the Exchange Fund sufficient to rectify this
deficiency. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid promptly to Schlumberger.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Schlumberger, the posting by such 



 

7  person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Schlumberger may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to which the holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any dividends and distributions
with respect to shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to which the holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c), in each case with respect to the shares
of Smith Common Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Schlumberger and the
Surviving Entity shall be entitled, without duplication, to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Smith Common Stock or any other equity rights in
Smith such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of Applicable Law and shall further
be entitled to sell Schlumberger Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to satisfy any such withholding requirement (which Schlumberger
Common Stock will be valued with respect to such withholding at the average of
the high and low trading prices of Schlumberger Common Stock on the
NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the day of such sale). To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Schlumberger or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

(k) _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of Smith, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances
and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Smith, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

(l) _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Smith shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Smith Common Stock thereafter on the records of
Smith. At or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares
presented to the Exchange Agent or Schlumberger for any reason shall represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Smith Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled to pursuant to Section 4.2(e)) and any dividends or
other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 4.2(c).

Section 4.3  _Certain Adjustments_. If, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding Schlumberger Common
Stock or Smith Common Stock shall have been changed by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any
similar event shall have



 

8  occurred, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide to the holders of Smith Common Stock consideration having the same
economic effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 4.4 _Associated Rights._ References in Article 4 of this Agreement to
Smith Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the
associated rights (the "Smith Rights") distributed to the holders of Smith
Common Stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 8, 2000,
between Smith and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (successor to First Chicago
Trust Company of New York), as rights agent, as amended to date (the "Rights
Agreement").

ARTICLE 5

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SMITH

Except (i) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Schlumberger by
Smith at or prior to the execution hereof (the "Smith Disclosure Letter") and
making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement to which
exception is being taken, subject to Section 10.10, (ii) as disclosed in the
Smith Reports filed after December 31, 2008 and prior to the date hereof
(excluding any disclosures in such Smith Reports in any risk factors section,
in any section related to forward looking statements and other disclosures
that are predictive or forward-looking in nature), or (iii) with respect to
any Smith Subsidiaries, assets, liabilities, businesses, operations,
or results of operations of the MI SWACO division of Smith (the "Joint

conducted. Each of Smith and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the
transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Smith Material Adverse
Effect. Smith has made available to Schlumberger true and correct copies of
Smiths certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended to date, and
each as so delivered is in full force and effect.

Section 5.2 _Authorization, Validity, Enforceability and Fairness._

and the consummation by Smith of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf of Smith,
other than

  

 

9  the Smith Stockholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Smith and constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of Smith, enforceable against Smith
in accordance with its terms.

or, to the knowledge of Smith, threatened with respect to any such matters.



 

11 (b) Smith and each Subsidiary of Smith hold all permits,
licenses, certifications, variations, exemptions, orders, franchises and
approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the conduct of their
respective businesses (the "Smith Permits"). All Smith Permits are in full
force and effect and there exists no default thereunder or breach thereof,

consent, approval, qualification or authorization of, or filing or
registration with, any Governmental Entity, except for any consent, approval,
qualification or authorization the failure of which to obtain and for any
filing or registration the failure of which to make has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Smith Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.6 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

(a) Smith has filed or furnished all registration statements, prospectuses,
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits
and any amendments thereto) required to be so filed or furnished by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 2006
(collectively, the "Smith Reports") and has made available to Schlumberger
each such document it has so filed or furnished, in the form filed with or
furnished to the SEC. Smith has made available to Schlumberger copies of all
material comment letters from the SEC and Smiths responses thereto since
January 1, 2006 through the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff
with respect to the Smith Reports. No Subsidiary of Smith is required to file
any registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule, form, statement or
any other document with the SEC. No Subsidiary of Smith is, or since January
1, 2006 has been, subject to any requirement to file periodic reports under
the Exchange Act. As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date
of such amendment), the Smith Reports complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder and complied in all material respects
with applicable accounting standards. As of their respective dates (or, if
amended, as of the date of such amendment), the Smith Reports did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders equity, as the
case may be, of Smith and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (i) such exceptions as 



 

13  may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (ii) normal year-end audit
adjustments which have not been and are not expected to be material), in each
case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein.

(c) There are no liabilities or obligations of Smith or any of its
Subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether
or not required to be disclosed) that would be required to be reflected on,
or reserved against in, a balance sheet of Smith or in the notes thereto
prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than liabilities or obligations to the
extent (i) (A) reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of Smith or (B) readily apparent in the notes thereto, in each

ended September 30, 2009, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the

owned Subsidiaries.

Section 5.7 _Controls and Procedures._

(a) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"), Smith has been and is in compliance in all material respects with (i)
the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(b) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Smith (or each former principal executive officer and former
principal financial officer of Smith, as applicable) has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Smith Reports. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(c) Smith has (i) designed and maintained disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation and knowledge, to its auditors and the audit committee of the Smith
Board (A) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which could
adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in its
internal controls over financial reporting.



 

14 (d) Smith has designed and maintains a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Smiths
management, with the participation of Smiths principal executive and
financial officers, has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Smiths internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2008, and such assessment concluded that such internal controls
were effective using the framework specified in Smiths annual report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. To the knowledge of Smith, there is
no reason to believe that its auditors and its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer will not be able to give the certifications
and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification,
when next due.

(e) No personal loan or other extension of credit by Smith to any of its or
their executive officers or directors has been made or modified (other than as
permitted by Section 13 of the Exchange Act and Section 402 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) since July 30, 2002.

Section 5.8 _Litigation._ There are no (a) civil, criminal or administrative
actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Smith, threatened against Smith or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective assets, or any director, officer or employee
of Smith or any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates, in each case, for
whom Smith or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable, or (b) litigations,
arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings, or injunctions or final
judgments relating thereto, pending or, to the knowledge of Smith, threatened
before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator against Smith or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective assets, or any director, officer or employee
of Smith or any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates, in each case, for
whom Smith or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable, except in the case of
either clause (a) or (b), for those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Smith Material Adverse
Effect. None of Smith or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective assets,
or any director, officer or employee of Smith or any of its Subsidiaries or
other affiliates, in each case, for whom Smith or any of its Subsidiaries may
be liable, is a party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment, order,
writ, injunction, decree or award of any Governmental Entity which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Smith
Material Adverse Effect. This section does not relate to Tax matters,
employee benefits matters, labor matters, environmental matters, intellectual
property matters, export control or trade matters, or the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, which are the subjects of Sections 5.10, 5.11, 5.12, 5.14,
5.15, 5.22 and 5.23, respectively.

Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2008, there has
not been any Smith Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence, change,
discovery or development of a state of circumstances or facts which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Smith
Material Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2008 and prior to the execution

owned Subsidiary of Smith, and except for dividends or distributions by other

Section 6.17 _Controls and Procedures._

(a) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Schlumberger has been and
is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

(b) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of Schlumberger (or each former principal executive officer and former
principal financial officer of Schlumberger, as applicable) has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the related rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Schlumberger Reports. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

(c) Schlumberger has (i) designed and maintained disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as required
by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation and knowledge, 



 

36  to its auditors and the audit committee of the Schlumberger Board (A) any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting which could adversely affect its
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial
reporting.

(d) Schlumberger has designed and maintains a system of internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.
Schlumbergers management, with the participation of Schlumbergers principal
executive and financial officers, has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Schlumbergers internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2009, and such assessment concluded that such
internal controls were effective using the framework specified in
Schlumbergers annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2009. To the knowledge of Schlumberger, there is no reason to believe that
its auditors and its principal executive officer and principal financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(e) No personal loan or other extension of credit by Schlumberger to any of
its or their executive officers or directors has been made or modified (other
than as permitted by Section 13 of the Exchange Act and Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) since July 30, 2002.

and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, advisors, agents and other representatives (with
respect to any person, the foregoing persons are referred to herein as such
persons "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
action to solicit, initiate, 



 

44  knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (including by amending, or granting
any waiver under, the Rights Agreement, as applicable) or any inquiry with
respect thereto, or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with any person with respect thereto (except to
notify such person of the existence of the provisions of this Section 7.3),
(ii) furnish any nonpublic information or afford access to properties, books
or records to any person that has made or, to the knowledge of Smith, is
considering making, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement,
asset purchase agreement or stock exchange, or option agreement, relating to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality agreements contemplated
by this Section 7.3), or (iv) propose publicly or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to (but not after) the date of the Smith
Stockholder Approval, Smith may, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives (A) furnish information and access, but only in response to a
written request for information or access, to any person making an Acquisition
Proposal to the Smith Board after the date hereof which was not solicited,
initiated, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by Smith or any of
its affiliates or any Representative of Smith or any of its Subsidiaries on or
after the date hereof and (B) may participate in discussions and negotiate
with such person concerning any such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if and
only if, in any such case set forth in clause (A) or (B) of this sentence, (i)
Smith has not breached this Section 7.3(a) in any material respect with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the Smith Board concludes in good
faith, after receipt of the advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Proposal, and (iii) Smith receives from the person
making such an Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement the
material terms of which, as they relate to confidentiality, are (without
regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects
(x) no less favorable to Smith and (y) no less restrictive to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement dated April 14, 2009 between Schlumberger and Smith
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") and any information provided to such person
has previously been provided to Schlumberger or is provided to Schlumberger
concurrently with its provision to such person.

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.3(b), the Smith Board
shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by
Smiths stockholders, and unless permitted by this Section 7.3(b), neither the
Smith Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw, modify
or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in
any manner adverse to Schlumberger or its affiliates, the approval of this
Agreement, the Merger or the Smith Recommendation, except for notice provided
to Schlumberger with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and Smiths views
thereof prior to any definitive Change in Recommendation (any of the
foregoing, a "Change in Recommendation") or (ii) approve, endorse or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend,
any Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in
Recommendation shall include any approval, endorsement or recommendation (or
public proposal to approve, endorse or recommend), by the Smith Board or any
committee thereof of an Acquisition Proposal, but shall not include any
notice provided to Schlumberger with respect to 



 

45  such Acquisition Proposal and Smiths views thereof prior to any definitive
Change in Recommendation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Smith Board shall be permitted not to
recommend to Smiths stockholders that they give the Smith Stockholder
Approval, to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose to publicly
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Schlumberger or
its affiliates the Smith Recommendation, or to approve, endorse or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, only if and to the extent that all of the following conditions are
met: (i) the Smith Stockholder Approval has not been obtained; (ii) the Smith
Board determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel,
that failure to so withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify the Smith
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary duties to stockholders under Applicable Law; and (iii)
before taking any such action, Smith promptly gives Schlumberger three
business days written notice advising Schlumberger of the decision of the
Smith Board to take such action _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding any
Change in Recommendation, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with the terms hereof, Smith shall nevertheless submit this Agreement and the
Merger to the stockholders of Smith for the purpose of obtaining the Smith
Stockholder Approval at the Smith Stockholders Meeting and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve Smith of such obligation, unless
Schlumberger otherwise directs Smith in writing or this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the Smith Stockholders
Meeting. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, Smith may terminate this
Agreement, upon payment of the Smith Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 9.5(a), in order to enter into any agreement, understanding
or arrangement providing for an Acquisition Proposal if all of the following
conditions are met: (x) the Smith Stockholder Approval has not been obtained,
(y) Smith gives Schlumberger written notice at least three business days prior
to taking such action, which notice advises Schlumberger of the intention of
the Smith Board to take such action and such notice specifies the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and identifies the person
making such Acquisition Proposal (provided that if there are any subsequent
changes in the financial terms of such proposal, Smith will not take any such
action prior to the second business day following a subsequent notice to
Schlumberger of such changes) (it being understood that there may be multiple
extensions); and (z) the Smith Board determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and does not revoke such
determination notwithstanding any revisions to the terms of the Merger or
this Agreement proposed by Schlumberger after being notified pursuant to
clause (y).

(c) In the event Smith receives an Acquisition Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to Smith or any Subsidiary of Smith or for
access to the properties, books or records of Smith or any Subsidiary of Smith
by any person that has made or, to the knowledge of Smith, would reasonably
be expected to make, an Acquisition Proposal, Smith will (i) as promptly as
practicable (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or request) notify (which notice shall be provided
orally and confirmed in writing and shall identify the person making such
Acquisition Proposal or request and set forth the material terms thereof, to
the extent known) Schlumberger thereof and (ii) will keep Schlumberger
reasonably and promptly informed of the status and material terms of
(including with respect to changes to the status or material terms of) any
such Acquisition Proposal or request.



 

46 (d) Subject to Schlumbergers rights under Article 9, nothing in this Section
7.3 shall prohibit the Smith Board from taking and disclosing to Smiths
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
other Applicable Law, if the Smith Board, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to so disclose such
position would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary obligations to Smiths stockholders under
Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that any such disclosure that relates to
an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation
unless the Smith Board reaffirms the Smith Recommendation in such disclosure.

(e) Smith (i) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated,
all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to
the date hereof with any persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) shall promptly request each person, if any, that has executed a
confidentiality agreement within the 12 months prior to the date hereof in
connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or
on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

"Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide written offer or proposal for, or
any bona fide written indication of interest in, any (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of any business or assets of Smith or any of
its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes 20% or
more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Smith and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or
more of any class of equity securities of Smith, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Smith, (iv) merger,
consolidation, business combination, joint venture, partnership,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Smith or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 20% or more of
the net revenue, net income or assets of Smith and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or (v) the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend
(whether in cash or in property) by Smith, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal for or
in respect of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Smith Common
Stock or all or substantially all of Smiths and its Subsidiaries assets (A)
on terms that the Smith Board determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) are
more favorable to Smith and its stockholders than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) that constitutes a transaction that
is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into
account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.



 

47 (g) Smith agrees that it will take the necessary steps promptly to inform its
Subsidiaries and its officers, directors, investment bankers, consultants,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 7.3.

Section 7.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to Section 7.2 and Section 7.6,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) the delivery of an officers
certificate to tax counsel setting forth facts which, in the case of a
certificate provided by an officer of Smith, relate to Smith and its
Subsidiaries, and, in the case of a certificate provided by an officer of
Schlumberger, relate to Schlumberger and its Subsidiaries, and which are
relevant to any tax opinion that may be reasonably required in connection
with the filing of the Form S-4 or the delivery of the legal opinions
described in Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(b), and (v) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement/Prospectus_. 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Schlumberger and Smith shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and Schlumberger shall prepare and file the Form S-4.
The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included in and will constitute a part
of the Form S-4 as Schlumbergers prospectus. The Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus shall comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.

(b) Each of Schlumberger and Smith shall use reasonable best efforts to have
the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby.

(c) Schlumberger and Smith shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other party copies of any written comments, and advise
the other party of any oral comments, received from the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Schlumberger shall provide Smith with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Form S-4 and any communications prior to filing such with the SEC, and
will promptly provide Smith with a copy of all such filings and communications
made with the SEC.



 

48 (d) Schlumberger shall take any action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a
general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of
Schlumberger Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and Smith shall
furnish all information concerning Smith and the holders of Smith Common Stock
as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each party
shall advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Schlumberger Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.

(e) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Schlumberger or Smith, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Schlumberger or Smith which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of Smith.

Section 7.6  _Filings, Etc_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to Section 7.6(c) and the other terms and conditions herein
provided and without limiting the foregoing, Smith and Schlumberger shall
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to):

(i) make their respective required filings (and filings considered by
Schlumberger to be advisable) under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation and
any other Regulatory Laws (and shall share equally all filing fees incident 



 

49  thereto), which filings shall be made promptly, but in no event later than
10 days after the date hereof with respect to the filing under the HSR Act,
and thereafter shall promptly make any other required submissions under the
HSR Act or other such laws;

(ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in (A)
determining which filings are required (or considered by Schlumberger to be
advisable) to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the
Effective Time from, Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such
filings;

(iii) promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to that party from any Governmental Entity and consult with and permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed communication concerning this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to any Governmental Entity;

(iv) not agree to participate in any meeting or substantive discussion
(including, without limitation, any discussion relating to the antitrust
merits, any potential remedies, commitments or undertakings, the timing of any
waivers, consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations, and any
agreement regarding the timing of consummation of the Merger) with any
Governmental Entity relating to any filings or investigation concerning this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with the other party and its representatives in
advance and invites the other partys representatives to attend unless the
Governmental Entity prohibits such attendance;

 

(v) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with draft copies prior to submission to a Governmental
Entity, with reasonable time and opportunity to comment, of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) that they, their affiliates or their respective
representatives intend to submit to any Governmental Entity, it being
understood that correspondence, filings and communications received from any
Governmental Entity shall be immediately provided to the other party upon
receipt;

(vi) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party and its affiliates may reasonably request in connection with
their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of
information to 



 

50  any Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, any filings
necessary or appropriate under the provisions of Regulatory Laws; and

(vii) deliver to the other partys outside counsel complete copies of all
documents furnished to any Governmental Entity as part of any filing.

(c) Schlumberger shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other person relating to
the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Regulatory Law, subject to
the provisions of Section 7.6(a), Section 7.6(b), Section 7.6(d) and Section
7.6(e). Smith shall not make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or
otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Entity
with respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or
remedy, or, in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence,
timing or scheduling, except as specifically requested by or agreed with
Schlumberger. Smith shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide full and
effective support of Schlumberger in all material respects in all such
negotiations and discussions to the extent requested by Schlumberger.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Schlumberger and Merger Sub shall take all
such action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, the European Commission, state antitrust
enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction, or any other person, may assert under Regulatory Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate,
and minimize the impact of, each and every impediment under Regulatory Laws
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so
as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the Termination Date); _provided, however_ , that nothing
contained in this Agreement requires Schlumberger, Merger Sub or Smith to
take, or cause to be taken, any action with respect to any of the assets,
businesses or product lines of Smith or any of its Subsidiaries, or of
Schlumberger or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Entity), or
any combination thereof, if such action would exceed the Detriment Limit. For
purposes of this Agreement, the "Detriment Limit" would be exceeded if the
assets, businesses or product lines required to be divested or held separate
in order to obtain actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations
or terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities under Regulatory Laws includes assets, business or
product lines other than (i) the assets, businesses and product lines acquired
by Smith in connection with its acquisition of W-H Energy Services, Inc. or
corresponding assets, businesses or product lines of Schlumberger or
its Subsidiaries overlapping with the assets, businesses or product lines
acquired by Smith in connection with its acquisition of W-H Energy Services,
Inc., and (ii) other assets, businesses and product lines accounting for not
more than $190 million of revenue of either Schlumberger or Smith for the 12
months ending December 31, 2009, excluding from such calculation (A) assets,
businesses or product lines described in clause (i) of this Section 7.6(d),
and (B) assets, businesses or product lines of the Wilson business unit of
Smith (which assets, businesses or product lines may be required to be
divested or held separate and if so will not be deemed to exceed the Detriment
Limit). If requested by Schlumberger, Smith will agree to any action
contemplated by this Section 7.6(b), _provided_ that any such agreement or
action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. The parties 



 

51  agree that the calculation of revenue shall be measured by reference to the
lowest such revenue of Schlumberger or Smith for each such overlapping asset,
business or product line so required to be divested, regardless of which
asset, business or product line Schlumberger actually divests. The foregoing
agreement in this section is made solely to facilitate the closing of the
Merger and does not constitute a representation or admission that the Merger,
if consummated without any modification, would violate any Regulatory Laws or
that agreeing to the divestitures, hold separate conditions or other
restrictions permitted herein or suggested by any person or authority acting
under any Regulatory Law would not be harmful to the parties.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Schlumberger
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to oppose by refusing to consent
to, through litigation or otherwise any request, attempt or demand by any
Governmental Entity or other person for any divestiture, hold
separate condition or any other restriction with respect to any assets,
businesses or product lines of either Schlumberger or Smith and shall have the
obligation to defend litigation instituted by such Governmental Entity or
other person with respect to the legality of the Merger under applicable
Regulatory Laws. In the event Schlumberger exercises its rights to oppose
through litigation, including any appeals, a request, attempt or demand by any
Governmental Entity or other person as provided in the preceding sentence,
and (i) such proceedings conclude prior to the Termination Date with a decree,
injunction or order restricting or prohibiting the Merger or (ii) no decree,
order or injunction has been issued in such proceedings prior to the
Termination Date, then Schlumberger shall take such actions, in a timely
manner, as are necessary to achieve the clearance or approval of the
Governmental Entity or other person prior to the Termination Date, _provided_
that Schlumberger shall not be required to take actions that would exceed the
Detriment Limit. If there is no decree, order or injunction restricting or
prohibiting the Merger, but the decision of a Governmental Entity in
litigation contemplated by this Section 7.6(e) is under appeal, Schlumberger
shall have the right to elect, and Smith shall have the obligation upon such
election by Schlumberger, to proceed to close the Merger if the other
conditions to Closing have been satisfied. 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Laws" means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the EC Merger Regulation, and all other federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative
and judicial doctrines and other Applicable Laws, including without
limitation any antitrust, competition or trade regulation laws, that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition.

Section 7.7 _Listing Application_. Schlumberger shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and the shares of Schlumberger Common Stock to be reserved for issuance
upon exercise of the Smith Options to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 7.8  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Schlumberger and Smith shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Smith Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Smith Common Stock) or acquisitions of Schlumberger Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to



 

52  Schlumberger Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Smith, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.9  _Schlumberger Options and Stock Incentive Awards_. As of the
Closing Date, to the extent necessary to provide for registration of shares of
Schlumberger Common Stock subject to a substituted Schlumberger Option or
Schlumberger Stock Incentive Award, Schlumberger shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), a post-effective
amendment on Form S-8 (or any successor form) to the Form S-4 (or any
successor form), a post-effective amendment to Form S-3 (or any successor
form), or such other registration statement or amendment as may be required to
effect such registration with respect to such shares of Schlumberger Common
Stock and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain such registration
statement, including the current status of any related prospectus or
prospectuses, for so long as such Schlumberger Options or Schlumberger Stock
Incentive Awards remain outstanding.

Section 7.10 _Coordination of Dividends_. Smith shall coordinate with
Schlumberger to designate the record dates for Smiths quarterly dividends to
coincide with the record dates for Schlumbergers quarterly dividends.

Section 7.11 _Inspection_. From the date hereof to the Effective Time, each of
Smith on the one hand, and Schlumberger and Merger Sub on the other hand,
shall allow designated officers, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives of the other access, at reasonable times, upon reasonable
notice, to the records and files, correspondence, audits and properties, as
well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and
financial position, or otherwise pertaining to its and its Subsidiaries
business and affairs, including inspection of such properties; _provided_ that
no investigation pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall affect any representation
or warranty given by it hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement or a partys provision of information or investigation pursuant to
the preceding sentence, no party shall be deemed to make any representation or
warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Smith on the one hand, nor Schlumberger or Merger Sub on
the other hand, shall be required to provide any information which it
reasonably believes it may not provide to the other by reason of
any Applicable Law, which constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep confidential by
reason of contract or agreement with third parties. Each party shall use
reasonable efforts to make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. Each party agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
7.11 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All nonpublic information
obtained pursuant to this Section 7.11 shall be governed by
the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 7.12 _Publicity_. Schlumberger and Smith shall, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, consult with each
other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise
making any public statement or communication with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition to



 

53  the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2,
neither Schlumberger nor Smith shall issue any press release or otherwise
make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the
other partys business, financial condition or results of operations without
the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Schlumberger and Smith agree to issue a mutually
acceptable joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 7.13 _Expenses_. Subject to Section 9.5, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses, except as otherwise agreed in
writing by the parties, including the costs of any economists or other experts
utilized by outside counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 7.14 _Rights Agreement_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Smith Board
shall take any action (including, as necessary, amending or terminating (but
with respect to termination, only as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) the Rights Agreement) necessary so that (a) none of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the conversion of shares of Smith Common Stock
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement hereby will cause (i) the Smith Rights to
become exercisable under the Rights Agreement, (ii) Schlumberger or any of its
affiliates to be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Rights
Agreement), (iii) the provisions of Section 11 or Section 13 of the Rights
Agreement to become applicable to any such event or (iv) the "Distribution
Date" or the "Shares Acquisition Date" (each as defined in the
Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event, and (b) the "Final Expiration
Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of the Smith Rights will occur
immediately prior to the Effective Time so that the Smith Rights will expire
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without the prior written consent of
Schlumberger, neither the Smith Board nor Smith shall take any other action to
terminate the Rights Agreement, redeem the Smith Rights, cause any person not
to be or become an "Acquiring Person" or otherwise amend the Rights Agreement
in a manner, or take any other action under the Rights Agreement, adverse to
Schlumberger or its affiliates.

Section 7.15 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"business combination," or "control share acquisition" statute or other
similar statute or regulation is or shall become applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Smith and the Smith Board shall
use all reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and shall
otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. Smith shall give Schlumberger the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against Smith and/or its directors or officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Smith agrees that it shall not
settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced on or after the date hereof
against Smith or any of its directors or officers by any stockholder of Smith
relating to this Agreement, the Merger, any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise,



 

54  without the prior written consent of Schlumberger (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 7.17 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Schlumberger and the Surviving Entity
(i) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is, or at any
time prior to the Effective Time has been, a director, officer or employee
of Smith or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who is, or at any time
prior to the Effective Time, served at the request of Smith as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and,
collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all expense, liability and
loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise Taxes or
penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or
suffered by such person in connection with any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "Action"), by
reason of the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of Smith, any of its Subsidiaries or any such corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, and (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the same such extent;  _provided_ that the person to whom fees
and expenses are advanced shall, if required by Applicable Law, provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification; and  _provided, further_ , that
the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Entity) in addition to local counsel for all Indemnified Parties in
any single Action unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified
Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interest between two or more of such
Indemnified Parties.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Smith may purchase a "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policy covering the Indemnified Parties who
are or at any time prior to the Effective Time covered by Smiths existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies for at least six years
after the Effective Time on terms no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than such existing insurance, _provided_ that the premium thereof
shall not exceed the amount specified in Section 7.17(a) of the Smith
Disclosure Letter. If Smith does not purchase such a policy, then for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause
to be maintained officers and directors liability insurance covering the
Indemnified Parties who are, or at any time prior to the Effective Time were,
covered by Smiths existing officers and directors liability insurance
policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than such existing insurance, _provided_ that the Surviving Entity
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by Smith prior to the date hereof (the amount of which
premium is set forth in Section 7.17(b)(2) of the Smith Disclosure
Letter), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. In either case, Schlumberger and the Surviving
Entity will maintain such policies in full force and effect and honor the
obligations thereunder.

 



 

55 (c) In the event Schlumberger or the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.17.

Section 7.18 _Certain Benefits_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Schlumberger and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Entity) will honor in accordance with their terms all
Smith Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Schlumberger
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and former
employee of Smith and its Subsidiaries (the "Covered Employees") compensation
and benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
compensation and benefits provided to each such Covered Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, excluding for purposes of this comparison any
equity-based compensation; _provided_ that Schlumberger agrees to provide
equity compensation to Covered Employees substantially comparable to
equity compensation provided to similarly situated employees of Schlumberger.
For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Schlumberger shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, (i) to each Covered Employee who
suffers a termination of employment severance benefits in accordance with the
applicable severance plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of Smith as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (with full service credit
for years of service with Smith and its Subsidiaries (and predecessors)) and
(ii) to Covered Employees who are eligible for retiree welfare benefits
immediately prior to the Effective Time, retiree welfare benefits that are no
less favorable than those provided pursuant to the arrangements of Smith and
its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
(other than for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan, severance plan or program eligibility or retiree welfare eligibility
under any retiree welfare plan sponsored by Schlumberger or its Subsidiaries
(other than under plans sponsored by Smith and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Date or a direct successor plan)) under the employee
benefit plans of Schlumberger, the Surviving Entity and their Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Covered Employees after the Effective Time (the "New
Plans"), each Covered Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with Smith and its Subsidiaries (and predecessors) prior to the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled,
prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar
Smith employee benefit plan in which such Covered Employee participated
or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time (and
to the extent there is no similar Smith plan, service as recognized for
purposes of Smiths 401(k) Plan), _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. For purposes of determining severance benefits under any New Plan
providing severance benefits based on years of service (other than under an
employment or change in control agreement) payable to a Covered Employee
whose employment is terminated in circumstances eligible for severance
benefits: (i) following the first anniversary of the Effective Time and on or
prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Time, 



 

56  severance benefits shall be based on the sum of (A) severance payable under
the terms of the Smith severance arrangement applicable to such employee as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time based on service with Smith
and its Subsidiaries (and predecessors) up to the Effective Time and (B)
severance payable under the relevant severance arrangement of Schlumberger or
its applicable Subsidiary based on years of service with Schlumberger and its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, (ii) on or following the fifth
anniversary of the Effective Time, severance benefits shall be based on the
severance payable under the relevant severance arrangement of Schlumberger or
its applicable Subsidiary based on the sum of years of service with Smith and
its Subsidiaries (and predecessors) prior to the Effective Time and years of
service with Schlumberger and its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time and (iii) between the third and fifth anniversaries of the Effective
Time, severance benefits shall be based on a formula which provides a ratable
transition between the severance determined under clauses (i) and (ii) above.
Following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Covered Employees will
be treated as new hires in any New Plan providing retiree welfare benefits,
with service credited only from the period beginning with the Effective Time.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Covered Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Smith Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Covered Employee, the Surviving Entity shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable plans of Smith or its Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time
and the Surviving Entity shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. Schlumberger agrees to consider in good faith,
and to consult with Smith in good faith between the date hereof and the
Closing Date in respect of, design alternatives with respect to equitable
treatment under (x) the retiree medical programs of Schlumberger and its
Subsidiaries of Covered Employees who have attained the age of 40 prior to the
Closing Date, and (y) the defined benefit pension plans of Schlumberger and
its Subsidiaries of Covered Employees who were previously employed
by Schlumberger and its Subsidiaries and participated in such plans.

(c) Schlumberger and Smith hereby acknowledge that a "change of control" or
"change in control" (or term of similar import) within the meaning of each of
the Smith Benefit Plans identified on Section 5.11(e) of the Smith Disclosure
Letter will occur at or immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
applicable.

(d) Smith may set and pay short-term incentive bonuses (i.e., bonuses in
respect of a performance period of one year or less) in the ordinary course of
business consistent in all material respects with past practice, _provided_
that (i) if the Effective Time occurs after the end of any short-term
performance period and prior to the time that short-term incentive bonuses 



 

57  for such period would be paid in the ordinary course of business consistent
in all material respects with past practice, Smith shall pay, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to each person who is a participant in a short-
term incentive program immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Bonus Plan
Participant") a bonus with respect to such performance period based on actual
performance for the applicable performance period, provided to the extent
that actual results are not yet available for such period or any portion
thereof, such bonus shall be paid following the Effective Time at the time at
which the actual results are available and (ii) for the performance period in
which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Entity shall pay, following the
conclusion of the relevant performance period to each Bonus Plan Participant
an amount equal to the amount payable based on actual performance under the
terms of the Smith incentive arrangement, payable at the time such amounts
would have been paid in the ordinary course of business consistent in all
material respects with past practice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Bonus Plan Participant who incurs a severance-qualifying
termination of employment prior to payment of a bonus for a performance period
described in this Section 7.18(d), the Surviving Entity shall pay such Bonus
Plan Participant, at the same time as bonuses for such performance period are
paid generally, a prorated bonus equal to the product of (x) the bonus that
would have been payable to such Bonus Plan Participant had he or she remained
employed through the conclusion of such period (determined without regard to
any subjective criteria that could reduce such amount) times (y) the lesser of
(1) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days that has elapsed
in the performance period for the short term incentive program through the
date of such termination and the denominator of which is the total number of
days scheduled in the performance period for the short term incentive program
and (2) one. For purposes of this Agreement, a severance-qualifying
termination shall include any termination of employment by Schlumberger and
its Subsidiaries other than for Cause (as defined in the Companys 1989 Long-
Term Incentive Compensation Plan) or any other termination of employment that
entitles the applicable Covered Employee to severance under an individual
agreement.

(e) As of the Effective Time, Schlumberger shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to) take all action necessary to effectuate the agreements
set forth in Section 7.18(e) of the Smith Disclosure Letter.

(f) With respect to any Covered Employees based outside of the United States,
Schlumbergers obligations under this Section 7.18 shall be modified to the
extent necessary to comply with Applicable Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Covered Employees are based.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
employee benefit plan, or shall limit the right of Schlumberger or any
Subsidiary, subject to their obligations under this Section 7.18, to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any employee benefit plan following
the Effective Time.

(h) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 7.18 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights
(i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any 



 

58  employees, former employees, any participant in any Smith Benefit Plan, or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with
Schlumberger or any Subsidiary. 

Section 7.19 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any
Tax imposed by Section 897 or 1445 of the Code or other income Taxes) with
respect to interests in real property owned directly or indirectly by Smith or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Merger, if applicable and
due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne by the Surviving Entity and
expressly shall not be a liability of stockholders of Smith.

Section 7.20 _Tax Matters_ _._ Neither Schlumberger, Merger Sub nor Smith
shall take any action or knowingly fail to take any action, which action or
failure to act would (i) prevent or impede, or would be reasonably likely to
prevent or impede, the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, or (ii) cause the stockholders of Smith
to recognize gain pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code.

62  Schlumberger of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of Schlumberger

(b) the Smith Board shall have failed to recommend its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or there has been a Change in
Recommendation, whether or not permitted by the terms hereof.

Section 9.5 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) Smith shall pay Schlumberger a fee of $340 million (the "Termination
Fee"):

(i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(b), and (x) such
termination occurs after an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known
to Smith (including any of its Representatives) and communicated publicly or
shall have been made directly to the stockholders of Smith by any person, in
each case such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been withdrawn, and (y)
within one year after such termination, Smith enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal
is consummated;

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(b); or

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.4(b);



 

63 which fee shall be payable: in the case of clause (i), upon the first to occur
of such entering into a definitive agreement or consummation referred to in
subclause (y) thereof; and in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), upon such
termination; _provided_ that for purposes of this Section 9.5(a), the
references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "50%". Any amount payable pursuant to this Section 9.5(a)
shall be reduced by any amount paid pursuant to Section 9.5(c).
Schlumberger and Merger Sub agree that in the event that the Termination Fee
is paid or may be payable to Schlumberger pursuant to this Section 9.5(a), the
payment of such Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Schlumberger, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective stockholders,
affiliates, officers, directors, employees or Representatives (collectively,
"Related Persons") against Smith or any of its Related Persons for, and in no
event will Schlumberger or any of its Related Persons be entitled to recover
any other money damages or any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity
with respect to, (1) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated, (2) the termination of this Agreement, (3) any
liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (4) any claims or
actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or
under this Agreement, and upon payment to Schlumberger of the Termination
Fee, neither Smith nor any Related Person of Smith shall have any further
liability or obligation to Schlumberger or any of its Related Persons relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(subject to Section 9.5(g)).

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Smith or Schlumberger pursuant to
Section 9.2(c) as a result of an order, decree, ruling or other action under
Regulatory Laws or Section 9.2(a) and all of the conditions to Closing set
forth in Article 8 (other than (A) the conditions set forth in Section
8.1(b), Section 8.1(c) and Section 8.1(d) and (B) those other conditions that,
by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but, in the case
of clause (B), which conditions would be capable of satisfaction if the
Closing Date were the date of such termination) have been satisfied or waived
on or prior to the date of such termination, then Schlumberger shall pay to
Smith a fee of $615 million (the "Reverse Termination Fee") (which fee shall
be payable within two (2) business days after written notice of such
termination). Smith agrees that in the event that the Reverse Termination Fee
is paid to Smith pursuant to this Section 9.5(b), the payment of such Reverse
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Smith and its
Related Persons against Schlumberger, Merger Sub or any of their Related
Persons for, and in no event will Smith or any of its Related Persons
be entitled to recover any other money damages or any other remedy based on a
claim in law or equity with respect to, (1) any loss suffered as a result of
the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (2) the termination of this
Agreement, (3) any liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement,
or (4) any claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach,
termination or failure of or under this Agreement, and upon payment to Smith
of the Reverse Termination Fee, neither Schlumberger, Merger Sub nor any
Related Person of Schlumberger shall have any further liability or obligation
to Smith or any of its Related Persons relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (subject to Section
9.5(g)).

(c) Without limiting the rights of Schlumberger under Section 9.5(g), if this
Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section 9.2(b) and no Termination Fee
is yet payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 9.5(a), or (ii) Section
9.4(a) because there has been a willful and material breach by Smith of any
covenant or agreement set forth herein, then Smith shall 



 

64  reimburse Schlumberger for its actual costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby in an amount not to
exceed $10 million.

(d) Without limiting the rights of Smith under Section 9.5(g), if this
Agreement is terminated by Smith pursuant to Section 9.3(a) because there has
been a willful and material breach by Schlumberger of any covenant or
agreement set forth herein and no Reverse Termination Fee is payable pursuant
to Section 9.5(b), then Schlumberger shall reimburse Smith for its actual
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby in an amount not to exceed $10 million.

(e) All payments under this Section 9.5 shall be made promptly upon becoming
due by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the receiving party.

(f) Each of Smith and Schlumberger acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 9.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither Smith nor
Schlumberger would enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either Smith
fails to pay, or Schlumberger fails to pay, as applicable, any amount due
pursuant to this Section 9.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, the party
entitled to such payment commences a suit which results in a judgment against
the party failing to pay for the fees to which reference is made in
this Section 9.5, then such party shall pay to the party entitled to such
payment its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest through the date of payment on the amount of
the fee at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as published
in _The Wall Street Journal_.

(g) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this Article 9, all obligations of the parties hereto shall
terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section 9.5,
the last sentence of Section 7.11 and Section 7.13, Section 7.17 and Article
10, _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability
for any willful and material breach by such party of any of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement, and all rights and remedies of
such nonbreaching party under this Agreement in the case of such a willful and
material breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and the provisions
of such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material
delivered by any party hereunder.

Delaware Court of Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (in
either case, the "Delaware Court"), for any litigation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and
agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in the
applicable Delaware Court) and agrees that any legal action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the
other party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought and
determined exclusively in the applicable Delaware Court. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the applicable Delaware Court for any reason other than
the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 10.7, (b) any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such court (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution
of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OUT OF THE
APPLICABLE DELAWARE COURT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF
COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED AIRMAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO IT AT ITS ADDRESS
SET FORTH IN SECTION 10.2 OF THIS AGREEMENT, SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS TO BE
EFFECTIVE UPON ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RECEIPT OF SUCH REGISTERED MAIL. NOTHING
HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER
MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO EXPRESSLY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE IRREVOCABLE UNDER
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Section 10.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one

Agreement are for the convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

otherwise requires, words describing the singular number shall include the

"without limitation." Any matter disclosed in any section of the Smith
Disclosure Letter or Schlumberger Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed
for the purposes of any Sections of this Agreement to which such section
relates and any other Sections of this Agreement to the extent it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such
other Sections. Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and
negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not



 

70  operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the
same or any other provision hereunder.

Section 10.13 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without

 _Exhibit A_

AMENDED AND RESTATED

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 

OF

SMITH INTERNATIONAL, INC.

FIRST: The name of the corporation is Smith International, Inc. (the
"Corporation").

SECOND: The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, 19801. The name of the Corporations
registered agent at that address is The Corporation Trust Company.

THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any successor statute (the
"DGCL").

FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 500,000,000 shares, all such shares being of one class
of common stock with a par value of $1.00 per share.

FIFTH: In furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the powers conferred by
statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, adopt,
amend, alter and repeal the bylaws of the Corporation, without any action on
the part of the stockholders, except as may otherwise be provided by
applicable law or the bylaws of the Corporation. 

SIXTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the
Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it
now exists or as it may hereafter be amended. Any repeal or modification of
this Article Sixth by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be
prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any limitation on the
personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of
such repeal or modification.

SEVENTH: (1) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"),
by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the
legal representative is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee
or agent, shall be indemnified 



 

A-1  and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her
heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as
provided in paragraph (2) of this Article SEVENTH with respect to proceedings
seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify
any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or
part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The
right to indemnification conferred in this Article SEVENTH shall be a contract
right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its
final disposition; provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, the payment
of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such person while a director or officer, including without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article
SEVENTH or otherwise.

(2) If a claim under paragraph (1) of this Article SEVENTH is not paid in full
by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received
by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful
in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in
defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on
the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she had met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

(3) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, By-Law, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.



 

A-2 (4) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself, any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation
or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the DGCL.

(5) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the
Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by
the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
of its final disposition, to any agent of the Corporation to the fullest
extent of the provisions of this Article SEVENTH with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors, officers and
employees of the Corporation.

EIGHTH: The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of
the DGCL, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended.

The undersigned hereby acknowledges that the foregoing is his act and deed and
that the facts herein stated are true, and accordingly has executed this
certificate this _ _ day of  _ _, 20 _ _.
