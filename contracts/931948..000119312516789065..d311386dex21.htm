an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent or US HoldCo may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, each
Share and each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for
all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and no other
rights or interests whatsoever. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the
cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.

 



     | 2.7.3 | Unregistered Transferees 
---|---|--- 

If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other

properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer
or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.



     | 2.7.4 | No Other Rights 
---|---|--- 

All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates and, from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or US HoldCo for transfer, the
Surviving Corporation or US HoldCo shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide the holder of such Certificates with such instructions as may be
necessary to permit such holder to receive the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger.

 



18 ---|---|--- 

Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving

the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.7 prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as a general
creditor thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration.



   2.8 | Dissenting Shares 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding Section 2.6 or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who is entitled to appraisal and who has properly
exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares;
provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
timely perfect, effectively withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be
Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.6.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of any
Certificate formerly representing such Shares. The Company shall provide
Parent and US HoldCo prompt written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relate to such demand,
and Parent and US HoldCo shall have the opportunity and right to participate
in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent and US HoldCo, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, or otherwise

     | 6.2.1 |

Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, during the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives and its and their directors, officers and employees and other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly take any action to encourage, or knowingly
facilitate the submission or making of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any

efforts to enforce, and not waive or modify, the provisions of 

---|---|--- 
 



51 entered into with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any potential
Acquisition Transaction; provided, however, that the Company shall waive
standstill provisions therein to the extent such provisions prohibit or limit
any Third Party from requesting that such provisions be waived or modified in
connection with the submission or possible submission of an Acquisition
Proposal in accordance with this Section 6.2. The Company shall ensure that
its Representatives and the Representatives of its Subsidiaries are aware of
the provisions of this Section 6.2, and it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 6.2 by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of this Section
6.2 by the Company. 
---|--- 



     | 6.2.2 | Notwithstanding Section 6.2.1, if, at any time prior to
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives a
written _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was
made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.2), the Company, the Company Board and their respective
Representatives may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.2.2, engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information to, any Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives if, and only
if, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and outside independent financial advisors,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal; provided, that (i) prior to providing access
to or furnishing any such information, the Company (A) receives from such
Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (B) if such
Third Party is already party with the Company to a valid and existing
confidentiality agreement as of the date of this Agreement, amends (if
required) such existing agreement so that it is an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, (ii) any such information so furnished has been previously provided
to Parent or is provided (including through the Data Room) to Parent
substantially concurrently with it being so furnished to such Third Party,
(iii) no confidential or non-public information of or relating to Parent, US
HoldCo or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be furnished except as required by Applicable Law, and
(iv) the Company gives Parent oral and written notice of such determination
promptly after the Company Board makes such determination (and in no event
later than 24 hours after such determination) and in any event prior to
taking any of the actions referred to in this Section 6.2.2. 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.2.3 |

The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt
by the Company) notify Parent (which notice shall be provided orally and in
writing and shall identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and set
forth in reasonable detail the material terms thereof) after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt by the Company) provide copies to Parent of any written
proposals or indications of interest with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
and/or draft agreements relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent informed of any
developments (including the status of discussions or negotiations) regarding
any Acquisition Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than 24
hours after receipt by the Company) providing to Parent copies of any
additional or revised written proposals or 

---|---|--- 
 



52 Proposal, and/or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal) on a
reasonably prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt by
the Company). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter
into any Contract with any Third Party subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with this Section 6.2.3. 
---|--- 



     | 6.2.4 | Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.2.4, during
the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or
resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case, in any manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, (C) take and disclose to the stockholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act if such disclosure does not include a reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation or state that the Company Recommendation remains
unchanged, or (D) adopt, approve, declare advisable or recommend to the
stockholders of the Company, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its
intention to adopt, approve, declare advisable or recommend to the
stockholders of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal (any action described in
this clause (i), being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change"); provided, however, that a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, or any substantially similar communication shall not be deemed to be a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding or Contract with respect to, or that is intended
or could reasonably be expect to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
Section 6.2.2) with any Third Party (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement")
or resolve, publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any
time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time, but not after,
the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Company Board may make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (1) such action is taken in
respect to an Intervening Event and (2) prior to taking such action, the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and outside independent financial advisors, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, however, that prior
to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of an
Intervening Event, the Company shall have given Parent at least five Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) |

during such five Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company
shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (and the Company
shall have directed its Representatives, including its outside legal counsel
and outside independent financial advisors, to have engaged in good faith  

---|---|--- 
 



53 changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to obviate the need for a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and 
---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | the Company shall have considered any adjustments to this
Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other
agreements that may be proposed in writing by Parent (the "Proposed
Changed Terms") proposed by Parent no later than 11:59 p.m., NY time, on the
fifth Business Day of such five-Business Day period and shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside
independent financial advisors) that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in respect of such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 

In addition, and without limiting this Section 6.2.4, at any time after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the time, but not after, the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company Board determines, in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside
independent financial advisors, that a written Acquisition Proposal made after
the date hereof that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2
constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may, subject to
compliance with this Section 6.2.4, make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; provided, that prior to making a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company shall have provided Parent five Business Days prior
written notice ("Superior Proposal Notice") advising Parent that it intends to
take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such
action and the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, including
the identity of the Third Party who has made such Superior Proposal, and
provided Parent a copy of the relevant proposed Alternative Acquisition
Agreement or the latest draft thereof or, if no such agreement or draft
exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, and any other related available documentation and
correspondence relating to such Superior Proposal (including any related
financing commitments and fee letters), and:



     | (A) | during such five Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
(and the Company shall have directed its Representatives, including, its
outside legal counsel and outside independent financial advisors, to have
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives)
regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such
Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the Company shall have considered the Proposed Changed Terms
proposed by Parent no later than 11:59 p.m., NY time, on the fifth Business
Day of such five-Business Day period and shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside
independent financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given
effect and that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



54 The Parties acknowledge and agree that any (1) revisions to the financial or
any other material terms of a Superior Proposal or (2) revisions to the
financial terms or any other material terms of an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal,
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require
the Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new
period (which period shall be three Business Days) shall commence thereafter,
during which time the Company shall be required to comply with
the requirements of this Section 6.2.4 anew with respect to such additional
notice.



   6.3 | Parent Recommendation 
---|--- 

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.3, during the Pre-Closing
Period, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or resolve to or publicly
propose or announce its intention to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify, in each case, in any manner adverse to the Company, the Parent
Recommendation, or (ii) fail to include the Parent Recommendation in the
Parent Shareholder Circular (any such action being referred to as a "Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the time, but not after, the Parent Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if
(1) such action is taken in respect to an Intervening Event and (2) prior to
taking such action, the Parent Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside independent financial
advisors, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Parent Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 



   6.4 | Access to Information 
---|--- 



     | 6.4.1 | Subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to) afford Parents authorized Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to Company Employees, Representatives, properties, books,
Contracts and records and shall furnish Parent, US HoldCo and Merger Sub with
all financial, operating and other data and information in the Companys
possession as Parent, US HoldCo and Merger Sub through their Representatives
may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide access to any information or
documents which would, in the judgment of the Company after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, (i) violate any Applicable Law or (ii) result in a
loss or waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries (it being agreed that the Company shall
give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) above, and thereafter the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive 
---|---|--- 
 



55 Applicable Law (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential
information, entry into a joint defense agreement or other agreement or by
providing such access or information solely to outside counsel to avoid the
loss of attorney-client privilege); provided, further, that any access or
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.4.1 shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of
the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries. 
---|--- 



     | 6.4.2 | No information or knowledge obtained by Parent, US HoldCo
or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.2, this Section 6.4 or otherwise shall
affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of
the Parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and
provisions hereof or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of
Parent, US HoldCo or Merger Sub hereunder, nor shall any such information,
knowledge or investigation be deemed to affect or modify Parents, US HoldCos
or Merger Subs reliance on the representations, warranties and covenants made
by the Company in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   6.5 | Notice of Certain Events 
---|--- 

During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of:

respective Representatives, from any Person alleging that the
consent, approval, permission of or waiver from such Party is or may be
required in connection with the Merger; 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.5.2 | any notice or other communication received by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions

     | 6.5.3 | any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth
in Article 7 to be capable of being satisfied prior to the End
Date; provided, that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.5.3 shall not be considered in determining whether the conditions
set forth in Article 7 have been satisfied; 
---|---|--- 
 

provided, however, that no notification given pursuant to this Section 6.5
shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement, (B)
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies contained in this
Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify Parents, US HoldCos or
Merger Subs reliance on the representations, warranties and covenants made
by the Company in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to amend or supplement the
Company Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach
of warranty or breach of covenant by the Company.



   6.6 | State Takeover Laws 
---|--- 

If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination,"
"fair price" or other form of anti-takeover law or regulation becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the

 



56  Company, Parent, US HoldCo, Merger Sub, the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, then each of the Company, Parent, US HoldCo
and Merger Sub shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such anti-takeover Applicable Law to the foregoing. 



   6.7 | Stock Exchange Delisting; Director Resignations

things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
Applicable Law and rules and policies of NYSE to enable the delisting by the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares from NYSE and the deregistration of the
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.7.2 | At the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to deliver to Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the
resignation of the directors of the Company, effective at the Effective Time.

     | 6.8.1 |

For six years commencing immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain officers and directors liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such Person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this
Agreement and from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current officers and directors liability insurance
carrier; provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this
Section 6.8.1, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
aggregate annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Current
Premium") and, if such aggregate annual premiums for such insurance would
exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available for
an aggregate premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if

foregoing, Parent and the Company may make public statements with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including (in the
case of Parent only) their effect on Parents business and its financial
projections, with investors, analysts and (in the case of Parent only)
Financing Sources, including on their respective periodic earnings calls and
in any "road show", so long as Parents and the Companys, as applicable,
comments are not inconsistent with the press releases previously issued and
agreed upon by the Parties.



   6.15 | Rule 16b-3 Matters 
---|--- 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including any derivative
securities with respect to any equity securities of the Company) pursuant to
the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company, and who would otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.



   6.16 | Employment Matters 
---|--- 



     | 6.16.1 | The Surviving Corporation shall honor all obligations
under employment Contracts to which it or any of its Subsidiaries and any of
their employees is a party. For the one-year period following the Effective
Time (or such shorter period as the applicable Continuing Company Employee
continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time) and subject to Applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide to each non-union Continuing Company Employee (i) at least the same
level of hourly salary or base wages and annual target bonus opportunity as
provided to such Continuing Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are at least as favorable (as determined
by the cost to the Company) as the employee benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided to Continuing Company Employees in the aggregate
under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, (i) with
respect to the Continuing Company Employees eligibility to participate in a
long-term incentive plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
shall endeavor to use substantially similar criteria and processes in
evaluating such eligibility of Continuing Company Employees as Parent does in
evaluating the eligibility of employees of Parent and (ii) for the one-year
period following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide,
to the Continuing Company Employees, severance benefits not less favorable
than the severance benefits provided by the Company pursuant to the Company
Benefit Plans and Made Available to Parent. 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.16.2 |

Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall cause any employee
benefit plans sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Company Employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing Date (collectively, the "Post-Closing
Plans") to recognize the service of each Continuing Company Employee with the
Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and,
solely for purposes of any vacation and severance benefits, levels of benefits
under such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same  

---|---|--- 
 



68 Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided that such recognition of service shall not (i)
apply for purposes of any plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii)
apply for purposes of benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any
defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement pension plan
benefits, (iii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Company
Employee with respect to the same period of service, or (iv) apply for
purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan
that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year
in which such Continuing Company Employee is first eligible to participate,
the Surviving Corporation shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any
pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Company Employee to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) credit each Continuing Company
Employee for an amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses
incurred by such Continuing Company Employee in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Continuing Company Employee
is first eligible to participate in such Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of
any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under
any such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been
credited under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
applicable information being provided to Parent in a form that Parent
reasonably determines is administratively feasible to take into account under
the Surviving Corporations plans. Such credited expenses shall also count
toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar
limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan. 
---|--- 



     | 6.16.3 | The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any
material written communications intended for broad-based and general
distribution to any current or former employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries if such communications relate to the compensation, employment or
labor aspects of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
communications prior to distribution.  
---|---|--- 



     | 6.16.4 |

Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, US
HoldCo, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Company Employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, subject in all
events to Applicable Law. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be
deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program or 

---|---|--- 
 



69 Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates or
(ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan, program
or Contract after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.16 shall create any Third
Party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or current or former service
provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments from the SEC
or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the preliminary Proxy Statement to be cleared
by the staff of the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof and the Proxy Statement to be filed in definitive form and be mailed to
its stockholders promptly after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no
further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy
Statement such that the Company Meeting is able to be validly held in
accordance with Applicable Law, the Companys certificate of incorporation and
the Companys bylaws as soon as reasonably practicable. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, or response to staff comments on, the Proxy
Statement shall be made by the Company without providing Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving
reasonable consideration in good faith to such comments. If at any time prior
to the Company Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties and the Company shall promptly file an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to
the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply

70 or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of
the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     | 6.17.2 | The Company shall take all actions necessary to duly
call, establish a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement (the "Company Meeting"), so that the Company Meeting occurs as
soon as reasonably practicable following the date the Proxy Statement is first
mailed to its stockholders, in accordance with Applicable Law, the Companys
certificate of incorporation and the Companys bylaws; provided, however, that
the Company may, in its reasonable discretion, postpone or adjourn the Company
Meeting after consultation with its outside legal counsel and Parent only (i)
if, as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Company Meeting or to the extent that at such time the
Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Meeting (such postponement or
adjournment to be for no more than five Business Days and shall be to no
later than the date five Business Days prior to the End Date (such periods to
be calculated by reference to Business Days in NY)) or (ii) to allow time for
the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure
document that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) is necessary or
required to be filed and disseminated under Applicable Law, the
Companys certificate of incorporation or the Companys bylaws (such
postponement or adjournment to be for no more than a reasonable amount of time
and shall be to no later than the date three Business Days in NY prior to the
End Date). Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a
different record date for the Company Meeting without the prior written
consent of Parent, unless required to do so by the DGCL. If the record date
for the Company Meeting is changed, the Company shall, as to that record date,
comply with each of its obligations under this Section 6.17. In connection
with the Company Meeting, the Company shall, (i) unless there has been
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.2.4, use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, and (ii)
otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. The
Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation,
unless there has been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance
with Section 6.2.4. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall submit this Agreement for the adoption by its stockholders at
the Company Meeting whether or not a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have occurred or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or otherwise made known to the Company, the Company Board or the
Companys Representatives or its stockholders.

Shareholder Circular to be approved by the JSE in order to be posted and
disseminated to its shareholders, in each case, as and to the extent required
by the Listings Requirements and any other Applicable Law, as soon as
reasonably practicable. If at any time prior to the Parent Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,
is discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Parent Shareholder Circular, so that the

in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid with
respect to such extended or replacement Letter of Credit. Failure to deliver
such extended or replacement Letter of Credit in accordance with this Section
6.19.3 shall entitle the Company to immediately draw the full amount of the
Letter of Credit (subject to return to Parent in the event that it is later
determined that the Company is not the prevailing party with respect to such
Proceeding).

been cured by Parent within 30 calendar days after written notice has been
given by the Company to Parent of such breach, failure to perform or failure
to be true and correct (or, if earlier, by the End Date); provided, however,
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1.4(i) if, at the time such termination would otherwise take effect in
accordance with the foregoing, the Company is in material breach of this
Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | if, prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder
Approval, the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) shall have failed to
include the Parent Recommendation in the Parent Shareholder Circular or shall
have otherwise made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) Parent
shall have Deliberately violated or breached Section 6.18 in a manner that has
a material adverse impact on the timing of, or the ability to obtain, the
Parent Shareholder Approval.  
---|---|--- 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1
(other than pursuant to Section 8.1.1) shall give notice of such termination
to each other Party of the basis for such termination and specify in
reasonable detail the applicable provision or provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effected.

 



   8.2 | Effect of Termination 
---|--- 

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect without liability of any Party or any
Representative of such Party to each other Party; provided, however, that the
provisions of this Section 8.2, the last two sentences of Section 6.11.2,
clause (ii) of Section 6.12.2, Section 8.3, Article 9 and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 8.1;
provided, further, that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any
liability for any fraud or a Deliberate breach of this Agreement prior to
such termination.

 



78 ---|--- 



     | 8.3.1 | If this Agreement is terminated by: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Parent pursuant to Section 8.1.3(ii) or either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1.2(i) or 8.1.2(ii), and in any such case (x)
prior to the date of such termination (or the date of the Company Meeting in
the case of termination pursuant to Section 8.1.2(ii)), an Acquisition
Proposal or an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly disclosed and (y) within nine months after such termination, (1) the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.3.1(i), the references
to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Transaction shall be deemed to be
references to "50%") with a Third Party that is thereafter consummated or (2)
the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by any Acquisition
Proposal with a Third Party, which, in the case of (1) or (2) need not be the
same Acquisition Proposal described in clause (x) above; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Parent pursuant to Section 8.1.3(i); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
8.1.2(ii); 
---|---|--- 

then, in the case of Section 8.3.1(i) or 8.3.1(ii), the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent or Parents designee(s), as the case may be, an
amount in cash equal to $16,500,000 (the "Company Termination Fee") _plus_ the
Parent Expense Reimbursement, or in the case of Section 8.3.1(iii), the
Company shall pay the Parent Expense Reimbursement; provided, however, that
payment of such Parent Expense Reimbursement shall not affect Parents or
Parents designee(s), as the case may be, right to receive any Company
Termination Fee otherwise due under Section 8.3.1(i).



     | 8.3.2 | If this Agreement is terminated by any Party pursuant to
Section 8.1.2(i) and, at the time of such termination, any condition set forth
in Section 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.1.4 or 7.1.5 has not been satisfied, or if
this Agreement is terminated by any Party pursuant to Section 8.1.2(iii) or
8.1.4(ii), Parent shall pay to the Company an amount in cash equal to
$33,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") _plus_ the Company Expense
Reimbursement.  
---|---|--- 



     | 8.3.3 | Any payments required to be made under this Section 8.3
shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts
designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable, (x) in the case
of Section 8.3.1(i), on the same day as the consummation of any transactions
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal or the entry into a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and (y) in the case of
Sections 8.3.1(ii), 8.3.1(iii) or 8.3.2, promptly, but in no event later than
two Business Days (such period to be calculated by reference to Business Days
in NY) after the date of such termination. 
---|---|--- 
 



79 proviso in Section 8.3.1, any payment made by the Company or Parent under this
Section 8.3 shall be payable only once with respect to this Section 8.3 and
not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
if the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee shall become due
and payable in accordance with this Section 8.3, from and after such
termination and payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, in full pursuant to and in accordance with
this Section 8.3, the paying Party or any Financing Source shall have no
further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby other than for any liability arising
from a Deliberate breach of this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.2. Each
of the Parties acknowledges that neither the Company Termination Fee nor the
Parent Termination Fee is intended to be a penalty but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company,
as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fee is due and payable, for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.3.5 | Each of the Parties acknowledges that the covenants
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and that without such covenants the Parties
would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if either Parent or
the Company fails to pay any amounts due by either Party under this Section
8.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a
Proceeding which results in an Order against the nonpaying Party for such
amounts or any portion thereof, the nonpaying Party shall pay to the other
Party their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amounts payable (or any portion thereof that has not been paid timely in
accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs and expenses,
in each case from and including the date payment of such amount was due
to through the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made.

certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the

   9.3 | Amendments, Modification and Waivers 
---|--- 



     | 9.3.1 | Any provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified
or waived at any time before or after approval of this Agreement and the
Merger by the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent, US HoldCo and Merger
Sub if, but only if, such amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and
is signed, in the case of an amendment, by Parent and the Company or, in the
case of a waiver, by each Party against which the waiver is to be effective;
provided, however, that following the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, no such amendment, modification or waiver shall be made or given
that requires the approval of the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL
unless the required further approval is obtained; provided, further, that
following the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, no such amendment,
modification or waiver shall be made or given that requires the approval of
the shareholders of Parent under the Listings Requirements unless the
required further approval is obtained; and provided, further, that no
amendment of any provision of this Agreement to which the Financing Sources
are intended third party beneficiaries pursuant to Section 9.11 that is
materially adverse to any Financing Source shall be effective without the
written consent of such Financing Source. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.3.2 | Any failure of any of the Parties to comply with any
covenant or condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the Effective
Time by any of the Parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a
written instrument signed by each such Party granting such waiver. No failure
or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 



   9.4 | Costs; Expenses 
---|--- 

Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred

82 ---|--- 

This Agreement shall not be assigned or delegated, whether by operation
of Applicable Law or otherwise, (i) by the Company without the prior written
consent of Parent or (ii) by Parent, US HoldCo or Merger Sub without the prior
written consent of the Company, and, in each case, any purported assignment or
delegation in violation of this Section 9.5 shall be null and void; provided
that Parent, US HoldCo or Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the
Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights and
interests under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent, US
HoldCo or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.



   9.6 | Governing Law 
---|--- 

This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out of or related hereto or to the
Merger or to the inducement of any Party to enter into this Agreement (whether

on common law, statute or otherwise) shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Applicable Law of the State of Delaware, including all
matters of construction, validity and performance, without regard to the

   9.7 | Jurisdiction 
---|--- 



     | 9.7.1 |

The Parties agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or

irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of
any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, or relating to enforcement of any of
the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought in
an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in
or by such courts. Each Party agrees that notice or the service of process in
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 9.1 or in any other manner
permitted by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees
that, upon the election of the Company and following written notice to Parent
of such election, each Party hereby consents to arbitrate any and all disputes
arising under or related to this Agreement, including disputes related to the
interpretation of this Agreement, under the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Act
("Rapid Arbitration"), and in such case each Party hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
located in Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom
located in Wilmington, Delaware, to support and assist the Rapid Arbitration.
For the enforcement of any award made pursuant to the Rapid Arbitration,
Parent hereby expressly (i) submits to the jurisdiction of the High Court of
South Africa, Gauteng Division, Pretoria in general and in 

---|---|--- 
 



83 African Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards Act, 1977 ("SA
Proceedings") and (ii) nominates its address as set forth in Section 9.1 as

documents relating to any such SA Proceedings. The Rapid Arbitration shall be
presided over by one arbitrator who shall be selected by the Company and be a
former Chancellor or Vice Chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court or a
former Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court and who shall not have worked
previously for, or have any conflict with, any party to the
Rapid Arbitration. In the event no such candidate is available, the Company
may petition the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware for appointment of an arbitrator pursuant to Section 5805
of the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Act. 
---|--- 



     | 9.7.2 | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each
Party further agrees that New York State or United States Federal courts
sitting in the borough of Manhattan, City of New York shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over any action (whether at law or at equity and
whether brought by any Party or any other Person) brought against any
Financing Source in connection with the Financing or in any way relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and that no Party
will bring or support, or permit any of their Affiliates to bring, any such
action in any other court. 
---|---|--- 



   9.8 | Waiver of Jury Trial 
---|--- 

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH (INCLUDING THE FINANCE DOCUMENTS) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.8.

 



   9.9 | Specific Performance; Remedies 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that (i)
the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including the Parties obligation to consummate
the Merger) (A) in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate court

 



84  therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware or (B) at the Companys election,
in Rapid Arbitration, as applicable, without proof of damages or otherwise,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3 are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement and shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any Partys right to specific enforcement, and (iii) the
right of specific performance is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and without that right none of the Parties would
have entered into this Agreement. The Parties agree that in any action for
specific performance, each Party waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement).



   9.10 | Severability 
---|--- 

Other than with respect to Section 8.3, which is an integral part of
this Agreement, if any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Entity to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties agree to
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in
order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.



   9.11 | Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries 
---|--- 

This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits to this
Agreement, the Schedules, the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent
Disclosure Schedules and any documents delivered by the Parties in connection
herewith constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person
other than the Parties or their respective successors, and permitted assigns

the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly
intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the
covenants contained therein, (ii) the provisions of this Section 9.11 and
Sections 8.3.4, 9.3, 9.6, 9.7.2, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.15, which shall inure to the
benefit of the Financing Sources and such Financing Sources shall be entitled
to rely on and enforce the provision of such sections, and (iii) the
provisions of Section 9.15, which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons
described therein. For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of Shares shall have
any third-party beneficiary rights under this Section 9.11 or any other
provision of this Agreement.

its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and that it has executed the same with the advice

participated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the

or preparation nor may any draft or position taken in negotiations by a Party
or its Representatives and not expressly reflected in writing herein be used
in any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the interpretation of any
provision herein. Any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that
drafted or prepared it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived by
each of the Parties, and any controversy over interpretations of this

preparation.

   9.14 | Counterparts; Effectiveness 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each Party shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other Parties. Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other Party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this

form, or by any other electronic means designed to preserve the original

claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this
