ARTICLE III

  

  

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES

  


 

  

Section 3.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (whether held in treasury or otherwise) or Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance
with _Section 3.01(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive $9.25, without interest (referred to
herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in cash payable to the holder
thereof. All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and each
holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with _Section 3.03_ , without interest, and except
as otherwise provided with respect to unpaid dividends and other distributions
in _Section 3.04_.

  


 

  

Section 3.02 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ ,
but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective
Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
appraisal as provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease
and

  

 

17  

  

such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ , without interest. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares
of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of any such demands and any other related
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of
the foregoing.

  

  

Section 3.03 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall select and appoint a commercial bank or trust company who shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender
of Certificates. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock immediately available funds in the amount of the aggregate Merger
Consideration under _Section 3.01(c)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ out of the
Exchange Fund.

  


 

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 3.08_ ) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance
with _Section 3.08_ ) for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares
of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ , and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or (B) establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
otherwise not applicable. Except as otherwise provided with respect to unpaid
dividends and other distributions in _Section 3.04_ , until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.03_ , each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Appraisal Shares) shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in this Agreement. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of any Certificate.

  

  

 

18  

  

Section 3.04 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the
date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. After
the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article III_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates.

  


 

  

Section 3.05 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 12
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and, except as provided in _Section 3.06_ , any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

Section 3.06 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheatment or similar
applicable Law.

  


 

  

Section 3.07 _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
_provided_ that: (a) such investments shall only be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (it being understood that any and all interest or income
earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent); (b) no such investment shall relieve Parent
or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Agreement, and
following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
in the amount of such losses; and (c) no such investment shall have maturities
that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 3.08 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with _Section 3.01(c)_ for the
shares of Company

  

 

19  

  

Common Stock formerly represented thereby. When authorizing such payment of
Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, Parent may, in its discretion
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to
post a bond in a customary amount or make a reasonable undertaking to
indemnify Parent or the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

Section 3.09 _Adjustment to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that prior to the
Effective Time there is a change in the number of shares of Company Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a distribution,
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender
or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event.

  


 

  

Section 3.10 _Withholding_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Applicable Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, and paid
over to the applicable Tax Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, as the case may be, in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

Section 4.06 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities;
Internal Controls_. (a) The Company has timely filed with or furnished to the
SEC, as applicable, all Company SEC Documents. As of its respective date, each
Company SEC Document (including any financial statements or schedules included
therein) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of

  

 

23  

  

2002 (the " _SOX Act_ ") and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the
Company (or each former principal executive officer and each former principal
financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the SOX Act with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate in all
material respects. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the SOX Act. The Company is otherwise in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable provisions of the SOX Act and the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules of NASDAQ. As of the date
hereof, there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments in any
comment letter received by the Company from the SEC or its staff.

  

  

(b) As of their respective dates, the Financial Statements complied as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, having been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto and, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Law) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto), and fairly presented, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to the absence of footnote disclosure and to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

  


 

  

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 4.06(c)_ of the Company Disclosure

the Company filed in the Company SEC Documents prior to the date hereof, (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since December 31, 2014, or in connection with this Agreement or the Merger
(including fees and expenses of advisors of the Company) or (iii) that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(d) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a
system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting. The Company (i)
has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures
prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of
the

  

 

24  

  

Company Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any identified fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls
over financial reporting. The Company has made available to Parent (I) a
summary of any such disclosure made by management to the Company's auditors
and/or audit committee of the Company Board since December 31, 2013 and (II)
any material communication since December 31, 2013 made by management or the
Company's auditors to the audit committee required or contemplated by listing
standards of NASDAQ, the audit committee's charter or professional standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Since December 31, 2013 and
prior to the date of this Agreement, no material complaints from any source
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and no
concerns from employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary regarding
questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the Company
or the audit committee of the Company Board. The Company has made available to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement an accurate summary of all material
complaints or concerns relating to other matters made since December 31, 2013

legally required to operate their respective businesses as such businesses are
being operated as of the date hereof, all Permits from Governmental Entities
(collectively, " _Company Permits_ "), other than those Permits for which the
failure to obtain or hold would not reasonably be likely to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any Company Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for any such suspension or
cancellation which would not reasonably be likely to result, individually or
in the aggregate, in a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each

of business;

  

  

(xiv) that obligates the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to conduct

(b) Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company or the Company
Subsidiary party thereto, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, except as would

which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is
bound, except for violations or defaults that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except for such conditions that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, no condition exists or event has occurred which (whether with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) would constitute a default by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other
party thereto under any Material Contract or result (other than due to
consummation of the Merger) in a right of termination of any Material
Contract.

Company and the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of Liens (other than
Permitted Liens), except where the failure to own or possess such licenses and
other rights that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(b) _Section 4.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct
and complete list of all Intellectual Property Rights owned by or held
exclusively by the Company or a Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Owned
Intellectual Property_ ") that are registered or subject to a pending
application for registration, indicating for each item the owner, registration
or application number, date of filing or issuance, applicable filing
jurisdiction and, with respect to Internet domain names, the applicable
registrar.

  


 

  

(c) Each (i) Contract under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
licensed or otherwise permitted by a third party to use any Intellectual
Property Rights and (ii) Contract under which a third party is licensed or
otherwise permitted to use any Owned Intellectual Property (such Contracts

Property Contracts_ ") is valid, subsisting and enforceable against the other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect, and will continue to be so
immediately following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section
4.15(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete
list of each Intellectual Property Contract that is used (or held for use in
connection with) or otherwise necessary for the conduct of the business of
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (other than licenses for commercially
available software) other than such Intellectual Property Contracts the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Intellectual
Property Contract is subject to any outstanding Order adversely affecting the

or adverse modification of any FCC License; and (iii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, no event, condition or circumstance exists or, after notice or lapse

Company has all documentation in its possession or reasonably ascertainable by

after taking into account the allowance for doubtful accounts in the Financial

Section 5.02 _Merger Sub_. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Merger Sub is, and immediately prior to the Effective Time will be, owned,

or the consummation of the Merger, other than (i) compliance with and filings

Section 5.05 _Financing Commitments; Sufficient Funds_. (a) Parent has
delivered to the Company true and complete copies of an executed commitment
letter (including all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets and the
executed fee letters (which may be redacted to omit fee amounts and other
economic terms) (the " _Fee Letters_ ") attached thereto or contemplated
thereby), other than the flex letter (the " _Flex Letter_ ") (collectively,
the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from CoBank, ACB and the other parties
thereto to provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein
(being collectively referred to as the " _Debt Financing_ "). None of the
provisions in the Flex Letter or redacted in the Fee Letters will limit,
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing in any manner.
As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated (subject to
Parent's right to replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to
_Section 7.10(b)_ , although no such replacements or amendments are
contemplated as of the date hereof), and the respective commitments contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on
or prior to the date hereof and the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force
and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the Debt Financing (including any subsequent approval process), other than the
Financing Conditions. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party related to the funding of the Debt Financing except
for the Debt Commitment Letter, the Flex Letter and the Fee Letters. As of the
date of this

  

 

42  

  

Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under
the Debt Commitment Letter or which would constitute a failure of any
Financing Condition and, as of the date of this Agreement, subject to the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Article IV_ , Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the
Closing.

  

  

(b) Upon the consummation of the Sprint Transactions and the funding of the
Debt Financing in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and
Merger Sub collectively will have at the Effective Time access to sufficient
funds for the payment of the Merger Consideration and to perform their
obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Company within the last three years.

  


 

  

Section 5.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first disseminated to the
Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to statements made in or omitted from the Proxy Statement
relating to the Company or its Affiliates based on information supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

  


 

  

Section 5.08 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person, other than Moelis and Company LLC, the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

  


 

  

Section 5.09 _Litigation_. Except for such Orders or Proceedings that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, there are (a) no continuing Orders to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound, and (b) no Proceedings pending and
for which service of process has been made against Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent.

  


 

  

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction
of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the
Merger, or waiver of such conditions, and (ii) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_
hereof, and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consummation of the Sprint Transactions and the Debt
Financing, and the payment of the Merger Consideration, payment of all amounts
required to be paid in connection with the

related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will
be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 5.11 _Management Agreements_. Except as set forth in this Agreement or
the Voting Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts,
undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
member of the Company's management or the Company Board, on the other hand,
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations
of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 5.12 _Sprint Agreements_. Parent has provided the Company with true
and complete copies of the Sprint Agreements, including all schedules and
exhibits thereto.

Section 6.02 _Alternative Transactions_. (a) Except as otherwise permitted by
this _Section 6.02_ , until the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to, or authorize any
investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate, any Alternative Transaction Proposal or the making of any proposal
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish or provide access to any Person any information with respect to, any
Alternative Transaction Proposal (except, subject to this _Section 6.02_ , to
disclose the existence of the provisions of this _Section 6.02_ ), (iii)
authorize, approve or cause or permit the Company to enter into any merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, memorandum of understanding, letter of
intent or similar agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to an Alternative Transaction Proposal (an " _Alternative
Transaction Agreement_ ") or (iv) agree or resolve to take any actions set
forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this sentence.

  


 

  

(b) Until the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (but in any event
within one Business Day) notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt of
(i) any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any inquiry, offer or proposal
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal or (ii) any request for nonpublic information with respect to the
Company or Company Subsidiaries relating to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal. Such notice shall include the material terms and conditions of such
Alternative Transaction Proposal or inquiry, offer, proposal or request
(including the identity of the Person making any such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request) and any amendments thereto.

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.02_ (a),
if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval the Company
receives an unsolicited, bona fide Alternative Transaction Proposal from any
Person that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its independent financial advisor, is, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company may (i)
furnish or provide access to information to the Person making such Alternative
Transaction Proposal with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that
the Company shall as promptly as is reasonably practicable make available to
Parent and Merger Sub any written information concerning the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person pursuant to this _Section
6.02(c)(i)_ to the extent such information was not previously provided to
Parent or Merger Sub) and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives with respect to such Alternative Transaction
Proposal. Upon Parent's request, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonably
detailed update on the status and terms of any discussions, negotiations,
inquiries, offers, proposals or requests relating to any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall

  

 

47  

  

provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within one (1)
Business Day after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft agreements
(and any other transaction documents to the extent such transaction documents
contain any financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, and a summary of the terms of any
financing commitments related thereto to the extent applicable and available)
sent by or provided to the Company.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.02(d)_ , neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, withhold, qualify, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii)
approve, adopt, endorse or recommend any Alternative Transaction Proposal or
Alternative Transaction Agreement or (iii) agree, propose or resolve to take
any of the actions set forth in clauses (i) or (ii) of this sentence.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, but
subject to the other terms of this _Section 6.02(d)_ , prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may (A) if an
Intervening Event has occurred, withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify
its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in connection
with such Intervening Event or (B) if the Company has received after the date
hereof an Alternative Transaction Proposal that the Company Board determines,
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and its
independent financial advisor, is a Superior Proposal, withhold, withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement and
the Merger and approve or recommend such Superior Proposal (any action in
_clause (A)_ or _(B)_ , a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), in each case if,
but only if:

  


 

  

(i) the Company notifies Parent and Merger Sub in writing (a " _Change of
Recommendation Notice_ "), at least four (4) Business Days in advance, that
the Company Board intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the reasons
therefor, which notice shall (y) in the case of an Intervening Event, describe
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances giving rise or relating to
such Intervening Event, and (z) in the case of a Superior Proposal, identify
the Person making such Superior Proposal, describe the material terms and
conditions thereof (including any financing commitments related thereto to the
extent applicable and available), and include unredacted copies of the most
current and complete draft of any proposed Alternative Transaction Agreement;

  

  

(ii) the Company negotiates, and causes its outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisor to negotiate, in good faith with Parent and its
outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) during such four (4) Business Day period (the " _Notice
Period_ ") to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Change of
Recommendation with respect to such Intervening Event or so that such
Alternative Transaction Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, as
the case may be;

  

  

(iii) at the conclusion of the Notice Period, the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
its independent financial advisor, and after taking into account any changes
to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, that (y) the failure to
effect a Change of

  

 

48  

  

Recommendation would reasonably be likely to result in a breach of the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (z) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, that such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and

  

  

(iv) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(i)_ promptly after effecting such Change of
Recommendation and immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with
such termination, pays to Parent any amounts required to be paid pursuant to
_Section 9.02(b)_.

  


 

  

In the event of any material change in the facts or circumstances giving rise
to any such Intervening Event or to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
(including any change to the amount or form of consideration), the Company
shall, in each case, provide Parent with a new Change of Recommendation
Notice, except that the Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days instead
of four (4) Business Days, before the Company Board may effect a Change of
Recommendation and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
required disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, failure to so disclose would reasonably be
likely to result in a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such disclosure does not reaffirm the approval or recommendation by
the Company Board of this Agreement and the Merger or has the substantive
effect of withholding, withdrawing, qualifying, amending or modifying, in a
manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the
Company Board of this Agreement or the Merger, such disclosure shall be deemed
to be a Change of Recommendation (it being understood, however, that a "stop,
look and listen" communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed a Change of
Recommendation).

  


 

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means an agreement with respect
to the confidentiality of nonpublic information concerning the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries that (A) shall be executed and delivered after the date
hereof, (B) does not prohibit the Company from fulfilling its obligations
under this _Section 6.02_ and (C) contains terms substantially similar to
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;

  

  

(ii) " _Alternative Transaction Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or
proposal relating to any (A) merger, joint venture, partnership,
consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender or exchange offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction or (B) other direct or indirect acquisition, in each case
under _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , involving 25% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or 25% or more of the consolidated total revenues or
consolidated total assets (including equity securities of the Company
Subsidiaries) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, other
than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

 

49  

  

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change, development or
occurrence with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole that (A) is material, (B) does not involve or relate to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal or Alternative Transaction Agreement and (C) is not known
to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement; and

  

  

(iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " means (A) any bona fide, written proposal made by
a third party to merge with or into the Company or (B) any bona fide, written
Alternative Transaction Proposal involving 50% or more of the Company Common
Stock or 50% or more of the consolidated total revenues or consolidated total
assets (including equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries) of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries through a tender or exchange offer, a
merger, a consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization, a
sale or a joint venture, in each case that the Company Board, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial advisor
and after taking into account all relevant financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal, including the estimated timing and probability
of consummation and the Person or group making such proposal, determines in
its good faith judgment to be more favorable, from a financial point of view,
to the stockholders of the Company than the Merger.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VII

  


 

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  


 

  

Section 7.01 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall, as promptly as is
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and the mailing of
the Proxy Statement (as defined below), convene and hold a meeting of the
holders of the Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ")
to vote on the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws and applicable Law. The Company Stockholders
Meeting may be postponed or temporarily adjourned (a) for the absence of a
quorum, (b) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) is necessary under applicable Law to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company's stockholders (including with
respect to the Company's receipt of an Alternative Transaction Proposal,
subject to the Company's compliance with _Section 6.02_ ) or (c) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company shall be permitted to take such actions at the Company
Stockholders Meeting as it otherwise would have undertaken at its 2015 annual
stockholders meeting.

  

  

Section 7.02 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as is reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC a proxy statement (together with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the adoption of this Agreement
by the holders of the Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. The Company shall as promptly as is reasonably practicable notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy

50  

  

correspondence between the Company or its Representatives and the SEC and its

of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (a) give Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
(b) include in such document or response comments reasonably proposed by
Parent. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated to the holders of the Company Common Stock as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the text of the Proxy Statement has
been adjusted to satisfactorily address any comments raised by the SEC. The
Company and Parent each agree to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Proxy Statement that shall have become false or misleading. Parent
will furnish (or cause to be furnished) to the Company the information
relating to Parent and its Affiliates to be set forth in the Proxy Statement
and otherwise cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.02(d)_ , the Company
shall include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board
that the holders of the Company Common Stock vote in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement. In the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
the Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation as permitted by this
Agreement, the Company nevertheless shall continue to solicit proxies and

not require the Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information to the extent that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, it
would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
violate any of its contractual obligations or any obligations with respect to
confidentiality or privacy (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
violate any such legal or contractual obligations); and _provided_ , _further_
, that nothing in this _Section 7.03_ shall require the Company to take or
allow any action that would unreasonably interfere with the Company's or any
Company Subsidiary's business or operations. In addition, from the date hereof
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives

reports (including a consolidated income statement, balance sheet and

to contact and hold discussions or negotiations with counter-parties to
Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party for the
purpose of obtaining the Consent of any such party and addressing any other
terms in such Contract as requested by Parent in connection with the Sprint
Transactions. Within fifteen (15) days after the date hereof, subject to
putting in place mutually agreeable procedures with respect to Parent's and
Sprint's review of such Contracts (which shall include, with respect to
Sprint's review, redacting customer names and other identifying information),
the Company shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to locate copies
of each Enterprise Customer Agreement (which efforts shall include contacting
the applicable customer with respect to any Enterprise Customer Agreement that

complete copies of each Enterprise Customer Agreement it was able to locate
(which copies may be provided by Parent to Sprint pursuant to the mutually
agreeable procedures contemplated herein) and (iii) provide Parent with

Agreements that the Company was not able to locate (which summaries may be
provided to Sprint pursuant to mutually agreeable procedures contemplated
herein). Within ninety (90) days after the date hereof, subject to putting in
place mutually agreeable procedures with respect to Parent's and Sprint's

efforts to (x) enter into replacement Enterprise Customer Agreements (on the
same terms and conditions) with respect to any Enterprise Customer Agreements
that the Company was not able to locate, (y) prepare written summaries of the
material terms of the other Enterprise Customer Agreements that the Company

Customer Agreements it was not able to locate or replace. In no event shall
the Company or any Company Subsidiary be required pursuant to this _Section
7.03_ to conduct or allow to be conducted any invasive testing of soil,
groundwater or building components at any property of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ shall
affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party or any
condition to the obligations of the parties. All information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement, and the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

  

  

(b) Subject to applicable Laws and upon Parent's reasonable request, the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Sprint and its employees and
representatives, in a reasonable manner during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, in order to facilitate (i) the migration of the
Company's billing, IT and other systems and (ii) the transition of the
Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' subscribers to Sprint; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company be obligated to provide Sprint
or any of its employees or representatives information that the Company, in
its sole discretion, reasonably believes is competitively sensitive or that
the Company, in its sole discretion, reasonably believes could be harmful to
its business if the Closing does not occur.

filed with any PUC to obtain the PUC's approval for the Merger and respond

  

 

53  

  

as promptly as practicable to any additional requests for information received
from the PUC by any party to an FCC Application. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, each of the
parties hereto shall make all Required Regulatory Notice filings immediately
prior to Closing. The Company shall, upon Parent's request, reasonably
cooperate with Parent and Sprint in order to jointly file all necessary
notices, reports and other filings with Parent and Sprint to obtain the
Required Regulatory Approvals. Each of the parties hereto shall use its
respective reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (y) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all
such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals and (z) taking all such
further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such objections, if
any, as the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, state telecommunications, utility, antitrust
enforcement or competition authorities of any other jurisdiction or any other
person may assert under relevant telecommunications, utility, antitrust or
competition laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement, including this _Section 7.04_ , shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate (or proffer, agree
or consent to any such actions), whether before or after the Effective Time,
any assets, properties, licenses, permits, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) or (B) proffer, agree or consent to or otherwise effect or
become subject to any changes (including through a licensing arrangement),
restriction or condition on, or other impairment of, Parent's, the Company's
or any of their respective Subsidiaries' (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) ability to own, lease or operate any assets, properties,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein
or Parent's or any of its Affiliates' ability, directly or indirectly, to
vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights
with respect to the stock or other equity interest of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, if, in the case of clause (A) or (B), any
such actions or requirements would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect the
combined business of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, taken as a whole
and after giving effect to the Merger and other transactions contemplated
herein (any such action or requirement, an " _Adverse Regulatory Condition_
"), and, _provided_ , _further_ , that (1) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall take, or proffer, consent or agree to, any of the actions or
requirements set forth in clause (A) or (B) without the prior written consent
of Parent and (2) neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required
to take any action that is not conditioned upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is
commenced that challenges the validity or legality of this Agreement or the
Merger or seeks damages or conditions in connection therewith, except as
otherwise permitted by this Agreement or necessary to avoid violation of
applicable Law, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. Parent shall be entitled
to control the defense and settlement of any such Proceeding but shall provide
the Company reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement
thereof.

  

  

 

54  

  

(d) At or immediately prior to the Closing, upon written request by Parent to
do so, the Company shall arrange for the delivery to Parent of copies of
payoff letters in customary form and substance, from the administrative agent
or other similar agents under any credit agreements or facilities or loan

pay off, refinance or otherwise satisfy at Closing, and for the release of all
Liens and other security over the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries'
properties and assets securing their obligations thereunder, as applicable,
together with the return of any collateral in the possession of the applicable
administrative agent or similar agent, at the Closing.

  


 

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.04(a)_ , in order to make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the
Merger set forth in _Article_ _VIII_ to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable, each party shall, and, to the extent applicable, shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its best efforts to perform all contractual obligations,
satisfy all contractual closing conditions and furnish all deliverables, in
each case, as is necessary under contracts upon which the closing of the
Merger is expressly conditioned (it being understood and agreed that in
entering in this Agreement the Company is relying in good faith on the
obligations of Parent set forth in this _Section 7.04(e)_ ); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, SPC or their
respective Affiliates to (x) (i) waive any contractual closing condition in
the Sprint Agreements, (ii) waive, relinquish or refuse to enforce any right
under any of the Sprint Agreements, (iii) take any action not expressly
required by the Sprint Agreements to be taken, including for the purpose of
(A) obtaining any Consents of any Governmental Entities or other Persons that
are necessary or advisable in order to consummate the Sprint Transactions or
(B) defending any Proceedings brought against Parent, Merger Sub, SPC, Sprint
or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to or in connection with
the Sprint Transactions or the Sprint Agreements, or (iv) agree to any of the
foregoing if, in the case of clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), it would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to adversely affect
in any material respect the expected benefits to Parent of the Sprint
Transactions taken as a whole (a " _Benefit Reduction_ "), or (y) initiate any
suit, action or proceeding to enforce its contractual or other rights under
any of the Sprint Agreements.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall not, and shall cause SPC and its other Affiliates not to, (i)
exercise the termination right set forth in Section 8.1(b) of the Sprint
Master Agreement or (ii) exercise any other termination right set forth in the
Sprint Master Agreement unless (A) the consequences of Parent not exercising a
termination right would reasonably be expected to result in a Benefit
Reduction and (B) Parent provides the Company with at least 30 days' prior
written notice in advance of exercising such termination right. Parent shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent
of the Company, (y) amend, change, supplement, modify, substitute or replace
any term or condition of any of the Sprint Agreements or (z) alter, change,
modify or restructure in any manner any of the Sprint Transactions unless, in
the case of each of clause (y) and (z), any such amendment, change,
supplement, modification, substitution, replacement, alteration or
restructuring would not prevent or delay the Closing or otherwise adversely
impact the Company.

  


 

  

Section 7.05 _Company Equity Awards_. (a) At the Equity Award Cancellation
Time, each Company Stock Option then outstanding (whether vested or unvested),
including each Company Stock Option with an exercise price per share equal to
or exceeding the Merger

  

 

55  

  

Consideration, shall be canceled and, in consideration of such cancellation,
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder on the first Business Day
following the Equity Award Cancellation Time, in full satisfaction of such
Company Stock Option, an amount (but not less than zero) in cash equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B)
the exercise price with respect to such Company Stock Option, and (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such outstanding Company
Stock Option.

  

  

(b) At the Equity Award Cancellation Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award
then outstanding, shall become fully vested and free of restrictions and shall
be treated in accordance with _Section 3.01_.

  


 

  

(c) As of the Closing Date, any outstanding Company Performance Stock Unit
Award for which the performance period has commenced shall become earned and
eligible to become payable pursuant to the terms of the award agreement and
the applicable Company Equity Plan as of the Closing Date, based upon the
Company's performance through the Closing Date and the Merger Consideration.
With respect to any outstanding Company Performance Stock Unit Awards for
which the performance period has not commenced prior to the Closing Date, such
Awards shall be forfeited without payment upon Closing pursuant to the terms
of the award agreement and the applicable Company Equity Plan.

  


 

  

(d) No purchase rights shall be granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
after the date of this Agreement, and all purchase rights outstanding under
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of the date of this Agreement shall be
automatically exercised on the purchase date next following the date of this
Agreement or, if earlier, immediately prior to the Equity Award Cancellation
Time (provided such purchase rights are otherwise outstanding at such date).
Between the date of this Agreement and the purchase date next following the
date of this Agreement, up to 2,000 shares of Company Common Stock may be
issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. To the extent that any
accumulated participant contributions to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
remain after exercise in accordance with the preceding provisions of this
_Section 7.05(d)_ , such contributions shall be returned to participants
immediately after such exercise in accordance with the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan and the Company shall terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of
the Equity Award Cancellation Time.

  


 

  

(e) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to
cause the actions and effects specified in _Sections 7.05(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_
and _(d)_ to occur, and (ii) provide reasonable cooperation to each other in
connection with the actions contemplated by this _Section 7.05_.

  


 

  

(f) All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 7.05_ shall be subject to
any required withholding of taxes and shall be paid without interest.

  

  

Section 7.06 _Indemnification_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and each person who served at the
request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including fees and

  

 

56  

  

expenses of counsel), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "
_Losses_ ") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time relating to the Indemnified Party's service with or at the
request of the Company, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent such Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification by the Company under the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws. From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent an
Indemnified Party is entitled to advancement of expenses from the Company
under the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws, expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by such Indemnified Party in defending any civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be
paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, subject to receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amounts to
the extent it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified under the DGCL. The indemnification rights
hereunder are not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under any Law or Contract or any organizational
documents of any Person, under the DGCL or otherwise. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor, provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that
are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those set forth in the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement, and those
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any of the Indemnified Parties. The parties
agree that the provisions relating to exoneration of directors and officers
and the rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses incurred in
defense of any action or suit in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws and the
comparable organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries with respect
to matters occurring through the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ that all rights to indemnification and advancements
in respect of any action, suit or proceeding pending or asserted or claim made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding or resolution of such claim.

  


 

  

(b) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.06_.

  


 

  

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be jointly and severally liable
for and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, shall pay (within
ten (10) days of receiving a reasonably detailed invoice therefor) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) that an Indemnified Party may incur in successfully enforcing the
indemnity and other rights and obligations provided for in this _Section
7.06_.

  

  

 

57  

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. No
release executed by any Indemnified Party in connection with his or her
departure from the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to be a release or waiver of any of the indemnity or other rights provided
such Indemnified Party in this _Section 7.06_ , unless the release or waiver
of the provisions of this _Section 7.06_ is expressly provided for in such
release.

  


 

  

Section 7.07 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any action taken
pursuant to _Section 6.02_ or _Section 9.01_ , Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon
and approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) any press release or other public statements with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, by court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

  


 

  

Section 7.08 _Employee Matters_. (a) With respect to employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements that are established or maintained by
Parent or its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
(the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") for the benefit of each person who is
employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date (the " _Company Employees_ ") and, to the extent applicable, any former
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Former Company
Employees_ ") (and their eligible dependents), Company Employees and Former
Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) shall be given credit for
their service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) for all
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and benefit accrual under
retirement, welfare, vacation and severance plans (but not benefit accrual
purposes under a defined benefit pension plan) to the extent such service was
taken into account under a corresponding Company Plan and (ii) for purposes of
satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations and shall be given
credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Company Plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Parent Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.08(a)_ , service and other amounts shall not be
credited to Company Employees or Former Company Employees (or their eligible
dependents) to the extent the crediting of such service or other amounts would
result in the duplication of benefits.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to and effective upon the Closing Date, Parent or one of its
Affiliates may make written offers of employment to such Company Employees
that it determines in its sole discretion. The written offer of employment
shall be for employment on an at-will basis and shall provide that, as a
condition of the acceptance of the offer, such Company Employee must waive the
Company Employee's right to receive severance benefits under the Company Plans
that provide such benefits. Any such Company Employee who, as of the Closing
Date, has

  

 

58  

  

accepted the written offer of employment from Parent or one of its Affiliates
is referred to herein as a " _Continuing Employee_ ".

  

  

(c) Beginning on the Closing Date and during continued employment with Parent
or its Affiliates, each Continuing Employee:

  


 

  

(i) shall receive the annual base salary or hourly wage that is specified in
the Continuing Employee's offer of continuing employment with Parent or its
Affiliate;

  

  

(ii) shall be eligible to earn an annual cash bonus or incentive payment for
the calendar year that includes the Closing Date that is equal to the sum of
(x) the amount earned under the applicable incentive plan that is a Company
Plan for the portion of such year that ends on the Closing Date _plus_ (y) the
amount earned under the Parent Benefit Plan that is an incentive plan for the
portion of such year beginning on the day after the Closing Date; such total
amount, if any, to be paid on the same date that incentives are paid under
such Parent Benefit Plan, subject to the provisions of _Attachment 2_ to
_Section 6.01_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and

  

  

(iii) shall continue to participate through December 31, 2015 or, if later,
the Closing, in the Company Plans in which the Continuing Employee was
participating on the Closing Date (other than the Company Equity Plans).
Parent, in its discretion, may allow Continuing Employees to continue
participation in one or more Company Plans after such date until the date
determined by Parent and thereafter Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in the Parent Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Parent Benefit Plans subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Section 7.08_.

  


 

  

(d) Prior to the Closing (or within a reasonable time after the Company
Employee rejects a written offer of employment, if applicable), Parent or one
of its Affiliates shall use its reasonable best efforts to give written notice
to each Company Employee who is not a Continuing Employee of Parent's
reasonable and good faith estimate of the date that the Company Employee's
employment with Parent and its Affiliates is expected to end; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such date shall be no later than the first anniversary of the
Closing Date. Beginning on the Closing Date and during continued employment
with Parent or its Affiliates, each Company Employee as of the Closing Date
who is not a Continuing Employee:

  


 

  

(i) shall continue to receive the annual base salary or hourly wage that such
Company Employee was eligible to receive on the Closing Date;

  

  

(ii) shall be eligible to earn an annual cash bonus or incentive payment for
the calendar year that includes the Closing Date that is equal to the amount
earned under the applicable incentive plan that is a Company Plan in which
such Company Employee was participating, subject to the provisions of
_Attachment 2_ to _Section 6.01_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and

  

  

(iii) shall continue to participate through December 31, 2015 or, if later,
the Closing, in the Company Plans in which such Company Employee was
participating on the Closing Date (other than the Company Equity Plans).
Parent, in its discretion, may

  

 

59  

  

allow such Company Employee to continue participation in one or more of the
Company Plans after such date until the date determined by Parent and
thereafter each Company Employee shall be eligible to participate in the
Parent Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent
Benefit Plans, subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 7.08_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Company Employee whose employment with
Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
ends before the second anniversary of the Closing Date shall receive severance
benefits in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the
Company Plans in which such Company Employees participated immediately prior
to the Closing Date.

  


 

  

(e) Each Company Employee who receives a Key Employee Stay Bonus Retention
Award in accordance with _Attachment 2_ to _Section 6.01_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be entitled to receive any amount that is earned and
becomes payable in accordance with the terms of such award.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this _Section 7.08_ constitutes a contract of employment or
guarantees any person, including any Company Employee, continued employment or
particular compensation or employee benefits after the Closing. In addition,
nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any Company
Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, policy or program or (ii)
give any third party, including any Company Employees or any successor,
beneficiary or representative thereof, any right to enforce the provisions of
this _Section 7.08_.

  


 

  

Section 7.09 _Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 7.10 _Financing_. (a) The Company agrees to use reasonable best
efforts to provide such assistance (and to cause the Company Subsidiaries, and
to use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives, to provide such assistance) as reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing as
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. Such cooperation shall include
each of the following: (i) participation in, and assistance with, the
Marketing Efforts related to the Debt Financing, including furnishing to
Parent and the Financing Sources, as promptly as is reasonably practicable
following Parent's request, such pertinent and customary information as
reasonably necessary to consummate the Marketing Efforts or assemble the
Marketing Material, (ii) participation by senior management of the Company in,
and assistance with, the preparation of customary rating agency presentations
and a reasonable number of meetings with rating agencies, (iii) timely
delivery to Parent and its Financing Sources of the Financing Deliverables and
(iv) participation by senior management of the Company in the negotiation of
the Debt Financing Documents and the execution (to the extent applicable) and
delivery of the Financing Deliverables. The Company hereby consents to the use
of all of its and the Company Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to, or reasonably likely not to, harm or disparage the

  

 

60  

  

Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective personnel or advisors shall be required to provide any such
assistance which would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. Further, such assistance shall not
include any actions that the Company reasonably believes would (i) result in a
violation of any confidentiality arrangement or material agreement or the loss
of any legal or other applicable privilege (provided that the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to perform such actions in a manner that does
not violate such obligations or privilege), (ii) cause any representation or
warranty in this Agreement to be breached or any condition to Closing set
forth in _Article VIII_ to fail to be satisfied, (iii) cause the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries to incur any actual or potential liability in
connection with the arranging, marketing or syndication of the Debt Financing
(including the Marketing Efforts) or such assistance or (iv) require the
Company or any of its Affiliates to prepare or provide any financial
statements or other similar financial data other than the Financial
Statements. All such assistance referred to in this _Section 7.10(a)_ shall be
at Parent's written request with reasonable prior notice and at Parent's sole
cost and expense and Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses as incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries in connection
with providing the assistance contemplated by this _Section 7.10(a)_ promptly
upon presentment of invoices therefor. Such assistance shall not require the
Company or any of its Affiliates to agree to any contractual obligation
relating to the Debt Financing that is not expressly conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger and that does not terminate without liability to
the Company or any of its Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement.
Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to make any
representation or warranty in connection with the Debt Financing or the
arranging, marketing or syndication thereof (including the Marketing Efforts)
prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties actually suffered or incurred in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing, any assistance or activities provided in connection with
the Debt Financing as contemplated by this _Section 7.10(a)_ , or any
provision of any information utilized in connection with the Debt Financing or
the arrangement thereof, except to the extent attributable to fraud or
intentional misconduct. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company and its business obtained by Parent or the Financing
Sources pursuant to this section shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such information may be disclosed
to "private side" lenders that agree to customary confidentiality obligations
in connection with the arranging, marketing or syndication of the Debt
Financing.

  

  

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable
to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement and to consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Such
actions shall include the following: (i) maintaining in effect the Debt
Commitment Letter, _provided_ that Parent may replace or amend the Debt
Commitment Letter so long as such replacement or amendment would not (A)
adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of Parent to
consummate the Merger or the Debt Financing, (B) delay in any material respect
or prevent the Closing, or (C) modify the Financing

  

 

61  

  

Conditions or create any new condition to the Debt Financing (other than the
Financing Conditions) if such modification or creation would delay in any
material respect or prevent the Closing or make the funding of the loans and
the making available of the commitments under the Debt Financing (or the
satisfaction of any condition to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to
occur, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis at or prior to the Closing all
Financing Conditions that are within Parent's or any of its Affiliates'
control, (iii) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents
that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including
giving effect to any "market flex" provisions contained in the Flex Letter)
and that are subject to conditions precedent to the consummation of the Debt
Financing no less favorable to Parent than the Financing Conditions (and, in
any event, on terms and conditions that would not materially and adversely
impact the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Debt Financing or the
Closing), (iv) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing
Conditions and the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ and _Section 8.03_ ,
causing the funding of the loans and the making available of the commitments
under the Debt Financing no later than the date on which the Closing is
required to occur hereunder and (v) using reasonable best efforts to enforce
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall give the Company
prompt notice of any Financing Failure Event. Upon the reasonable request of
the Company, Parent will confer with the Financing Sources and confirm, to the
Knowledge of Parent, (A) the Financing Sources' intent and ability to perform,
and the availability of the Debt Financing, under the Debt Commitment Letters,
subject only to satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions, and (B)
that Parent is not aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to result in the failure of a Financing Condition. Except as
otherwise specifically permitted by _clause (i)_ of this _Section 7.10(b)_ or
specifically required by _Section 7.10(c)_ , neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be permitted to amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign,
substitute or replace, or otherwise waive any obligation or remedy under, the
Debt Commitment Letter or any Debt Financing Document. Except as otherwise
specifically required by _Section 7.10(c)_ , Parent shall not consent to, or
otherwise effect, any commitment reduction, commitment termination, commitment
cancellation or other similar event under the Debt Commitment Letter or any
Debt Financing Document that would, in any manner, terminate, cancel, limit or
reduce the commitments of the Financing Sources to provide, subject to the
Financing Conditions, the Debt Financing at the Closing in a manner that would
prevent Parent from having the funds necessary under the Debt Commitment
Letter to complete the Merger, in each case, without the prior written
approval of the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall not consent to any assignment of rights
or obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior written
approval of the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (it being understood that such approval shall not be
deemed to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if such assignment
would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, materially impede, hinder or
delay the Closing or Parent's ability to obtain the full Debt Financing at or
prior to the Closing). Upon the Company's reasonable request, Parent shall
consult with and keep the Company informed upon request in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to obtain the Debt Financing.

  

  

(c) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
(including flex provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall (i)
promptly notify the Company thereof, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly arrange and obtain any such portion

  

 

62  

  

from alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ , that,
without the prior consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the conditions precedent to
such Alternative Financing shall not include any conditions other than the
Financing Conditions. Parent shall obtain, and when obtained, promptly provide
the Company with a true and complete copy of, any Alternative Financing
commitment and the executed fee letter associated therewith (with only the fee
amounts redacted), and to the extent applicable, thereafter (x) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing
contemplated by such commitment letter (including fee letters) for the
Alternative Financing, (y) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letter" or the "Financing Sources" shall be deemed to be the
commitment letter (including fee letter) for the Alternative Financing and the
lenders or other providers of such Alternative Financing, respectively, and
(z) any reference in this Agreement to the Financing Conditions shall include
the conditions to the Alternative Financing set forth in the commitment letter
(including fee letter) for the Alternative Financing referred to in the prior
clause (y).

  

  

Section 7.11 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its covenants and agreements, and
comply with its obligations, under this Agreement, including consummating the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 7.12 _Parent Vote_. Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or
cause to be voted (or cause a consent to be given with respect to) any shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to
be voted (or to provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
at any meeting of stockholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be
submitted for adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or,
if applicable, by any action of stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu
of a meeting).

  


 

  

Section 7.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall notify
Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company,
promptly of any event, change or effect between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to cause the failure
of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ of this
Agreement (in the case of Parent and Merger Sub) or _Section 8.01_ or _Section
8.03_ of this Agreement (in the case of the Company), to be satisfied. The
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.13_ , however, shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice. If any event or matter arises after the date of this
Agreement that, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or that is necessary to correct any information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule that has been rendered inaccurate thereby, then the
Company shall promptly supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule
that it has delivered pursuant to this Agreement and deliver such supplement
or amendment to Parent. No such supplement or amendment shall be deemed to
cure any breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or
have any effect for purposes of satisfying any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.03_ or the compliance by the Company with any covenant set forth
herein, _provided_ that the delivery of any such notice, supplement or
amendment shall not

  

 

63  

  

be deemed an admission by the Company that any condition in _Article_ _VII_ is
not or will not be satisfied or that a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred.

  

  

Section 7.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give the other party the opportunity to participate in, and shall keep the
other party reasonably informed with respect to, the defense of any litigation
against it or its directors or officers relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or the Merger; _provided_
, _however_ , that no settlement of any such litigation shall be agreed to
without the other party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  


 

  

Section 7.15 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its respective operations.

  


 

  

Section 7.16 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes, if any, and any penalties
or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes, payable in connection with the
consummation of the Merger, and all Stock Transfer Taxes, if any, and any
penalties or interest with respect to any such Stock Transfer Taxes shall be

out of the aggregate Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

Section 7.17 _Termination of_ _Shareholders Agreement_. The Company shall take
all actions so that, as of the Effective Time, the Shareholders Agreement
shall have been terminated and be of no further force or effect.

Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this

Business Day immediately following the date that Parent shall have designated
an account for payment of the Company Termination Fee as provided in this
_Section 9.02(b)_. For the purposes of this _Section 9.02(b)_ , "50%" shall be
substituted for "25%" in the definition of Alternative Transaction Proposal.

  


 

  

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

  

  

 

69  

  

(i) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ and (B) at
the time of such termination all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article VIII_ have been satisfied (other than (x) the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.01(b)_ , _Section 8.01(c)_ and/or _Section 8.01(d)_ (and the reason
any such condition is not satisfied is primarily attributable to the failure
to obtain a Required Debt Financing Regulatory Approval or a Required Sprint
Regulatory Approval) and (y) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at or immediately after the Closing and which were,
at the time of such termination, capable of being satisfied);

  

  

(ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_ and the
applicable Order or Orders giving rise to such termination are primarily
attributable to the denial of a Required Regulatory Approval that is a
Required Debt Financing Regulatory Approval or a Required Sprint Regulatory
Approval;

  

  

(iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(iii)_ ;

  

  

(iv) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(iv)_ ;

  

  

(v) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ ;

  

  

(vi) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(iii)_ ;

  

  

(vii) by the Company pursuant to _Section_ _9.01(d)(iv)_ ; or

  

  

(viii) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ , (B) at
the time of such termination all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article VIII_ have been satisfied (other than (x) the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.01(b)_ , _Section 8.01(c)_ and/or _Section 8.01(d)_ and (y) those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at or
immediately after the Closing and which were, at the time of such termination,
capable of being satisfied) and (C) there has been a Company Final Order
Waiver;

  


 

  

then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a fee equal to
$25,000,000, _plus_ an amount equal to the aggregate amount not to exceed
$2,500,000 of all fees, costs and expenses (including all attorneys' fees,
accountants' fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees) incurred by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and otherwise in connection with
the Merger and other transactions contemplated herein (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") within two (2) Business Days after such termination, by
wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the
Company.

  


 

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

  


 

  

(i) (A) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ _9.01(b)(i)_ and (B) at
the time of such termination all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article_ _VIII_ have been satisfied (other than (x) the conditions set forth
in _Section_ _8.01(b)_ , _Section_ _8.01(c)_ and/or _Section_ _8.01(d)_ (and
the reason any such condition is not satisfied is not primarily attributable
to the failure to obtain a Required Debt Financing Regulatory Approval or a

  

 

70  

  

Required Sprint Regulatory Approval) and (y) those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at or immediately after the
Closing and which were, at the time of such termination, capable of being
satisfied); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Required Regulatory Approval
from the FCC has been obtained but does not constitute a Final Order, there
shall also have been a Company Final Order Waiver; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Parent Regulatory Fee shall not be payable pursuant to this _Section
9.02(d)(i)_ in the event that the Parent Termination Fee is also payable
pursuant to _Section 9.02(c)(viii)_ ; or

  

  

(ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_ and the
applicable Order or Orders giving rise to such termination are not primarily
attributable to the denial of a Required Regulatory Approval that is a
Required Debt Financing Regulatory Approval or a Required Sprint Regulatory
Approval;

  


 

  

then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a fee equal to
$8,800,000 _plus_ an amount equal to the aggregate amount not to exceed
$2,500,000 of all fees, costs and expenses (including all attorneys' fees,
accountants' fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees) incurred by or on
behalf of the Company in connection with the preparation, negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement and otherwise in connection with
the Merger and other transactions contemplated herein (collectively, the "
_Parent Regulatory Fee_ ") within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by the Company.

  


 

  

(e) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that the Company receives the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 9.02(c)(vi)_ , the Company's receipt of such Parent Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against
the Parent Related Parties for any losses or damages suffered as a result of,
relating to or in connection with such termination, any breach by Parent or
Merger Sub of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement or the failure of the Merger or other transactions contemplated
herein to be consummated.

  


 

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Company
Related Party shall (x) have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source, any Affiliates of any Financing Source or any officer, director,
employee, agent, successor or assign of any Financing Source or Affiliate of
any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in each case, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise (and all such rights and claims
are hereby waived by the Company Related Parties), or (y) commence or support
any suit, action or proceeding against any Financing Source or any Affiliates
of any Financing Source or any officer, director, employee, agent or successor
or assign of any Financing Source or Affiliate of any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.02(e)(ii)_ shall in any way limit or
modify the rights and obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement, or any Financing Source's obligations to Parent or Merger Sub under
the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

  

 

71  

  

(f) Except as expressly set forth herein, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent and the Company shall share equally all fees and expenses, other
than attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the filing by the parties
hereto of the premerger notification and report forms relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act and the filing of any
notice or other document under any applicable foreign antitrust law or
regulation. Any amounts payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.02(b)_
shall be in addition to any amounts payable by the Company pursuant to this
_Section_ _9.02(f)_. Any amounts payable by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.02(c)_ or _Section 9.02(d)_ shall be in addition to any amounts payable by
Parent pursuant to this _Section_ _9.02(f)_ and any of Parent's expense
reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained in _Section 7.10_.

  


 

  

(g) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 9.02_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement and
(iii) any amount payable pursuant to this _Section 9.02_ is not a penalty, but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such amount is
payable. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than
one occasion and in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion or to pay both the Parent
Termination Fee and the Parent Regulatory Fee.

  


 

  

Section 9.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without
the further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 9.02(e)_ ,
_Section 10.06_ , _Section 10.08_ and _Section 10.11_ and this _Section 9.03_
(and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of _Section 9.02(e)_
, _Section 10.06_ , _Section 10.08_ and _Section 10.11_ and this _Section
9.03_ ) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or
is adverse in any respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Financing Sources.

  


 

  

Section 9.04 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso in the
first sentence of _Section 9.03_ , and to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

Section 10.03 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation" to the
extent such words do not already follow any such term. The word "or" shall not
be exclusive. The phrases "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar
import shall be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

  


 

  

Section 10.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement (i) may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement and (ii) shall become effective when signed by all of the parties or
when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to all
of the other parties. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by
facsimile or ".pdf" file shall be effective to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

  


 

  

Section 10.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and all Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, taken
together, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements,
arrangements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Financing Sources shall be third-party beneficiaries
of, and entitled to enforce, _Section 9.02(e)_ , _Section 9.03_ , _Section
10.06_ , _Section 10.08_ and _Section 10.11_ and (ii) from and after the
Effective Time, (x) the Company's stockholders shall be third-party
beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, _Articles II_ and _III_ and
_Section 7.05_ , and (y) the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party
beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, _Section 7.06_.

  

  

 

74  

  

Section 10.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of Laws thereof.

  


 

  

Section 10.08 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent
and Merger Sub shall be entitled, without the consent of the Company, to
assign its right, title and interest in and to this Agreement to any Financing
Source as collateral security for Indebtedness of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates in connection with the Debt
Financing. Subject to the two immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

Section 10.09 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable injury (for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy)
would occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or otherwise breaches such
provisions (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate the Merger). The parties acknowledge and
agree that each party shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, such remedies being in
addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. Each
party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other
party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. The parties acknowledge that in the absence of a waiver,
a bond or undertaking may be required by a court and the parties hereby waive
any such requirement of such a bond or undertaking. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the right of the Company to obtain specific performance, an
injunction or other appropriate form of equitable relief, in each case, to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and pay the Merger
Consideration shall be subject to the requirements that: (i) the conditions in
_Sections 8.01_ and _8.03_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at or immediately after the Closing, but subject to such
satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived,
(ii) Parent and the Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.02_ , (iii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or the Financing Sources (or the agent thereof)
have confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing will be funded at the
Closing and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that (A) the
conditions set forth in _Section 8.02_ have been satisfied or that the Company
is willing to waive any of the conditions in _Section 8.02_ to the extent not
so satisfied and (B) if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing
is funded, then the Closing will occur.

  

  

Section 10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue._ Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware

  

 

75  

  

Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable,
any Delaware State court and the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the State of Delaware) for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees that no such action,
suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of
its Subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the parties further agrees
that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such person's
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to
the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of
Chancery shall be unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

  


 

  

Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTERS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY
DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF), AND AGREES TO TAKE ANY AND ALL ACTION NECESSARY OR
APPROPRIATE TO EFFECT SUCH WAIVER.

  


 

  

Section 10.12 _Non-Reliance; Limitation of Damages_. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Representatives has made, in connection with Parent's and Merger Sub's
investigation of the Company or otherwise, any representation or warranty,
express or implied, including with respect to the accuracy or completeness of
any information, written or oral, relating to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Information_ "). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that neither
the Company nor any of its Representatives has made any representation or
warranty with respect to (i) any projections, forecasts or forward-looking
statements made or made available to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives or (ii) any memoranda, charts, summaries, schedules
or other information about the Company or the Company Subsidiaries made
available to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives
(including any information by any financial advisor for the Company), except
as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub also agree
that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
this Agreement, neither they nor any of their respective Representatives has
relied upon any representations or warranties of any nature made by or on
behalf of or imputed to the Company or any of its Representatives, and Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledge that, in entering into this Agreement, they have
relied solely on their own investigation of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
this Agreement, subject to the limitations and restrictions specified herein.
