allocated as provided for in _Section 7.9(d)_.

 



 

1.5 **_Deposit_**. As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, but in any
event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Date, Buyer shall
deliver to the Escrow Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account designated by the Escrow Agent to Buyer in writing prior to the
Effective Date, a deposit against the Purchase Price in an amount equal to 10%
of the Purchase Price (the " ** _Deposit_** "). Failure to deliver the Deposit
in accordance with this _Section 1.5_ shall constitute a default under this
Agreement and shall entitle Seller to terminate this Agreement. In the event
Closing does not occur and the Agreement is terminated, the Deposit shall be
non-refundable and released to Seller or returned to Buyer in accordance with
the terms of _Section 10.2_. In the event Closing does occur, the Deposit
shall be released to Seller and applied to the Purchase Price.

 



 

1.6 **_Closing Date Payment_**. On the Closing Date, (a) the Parties shall
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit to Seller, and (b) Buyer
shall pay to Seller, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by Seller no later than three (3) Business Days prior to

1.7 **_Independent Consideration_**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of the Deposit (the "
** _Independent Consideration_** ") shall be paid to Seller and considered
completely nonrefundable to Buyer in all events, it being the intent of the
parties to recognize that such amount has been bargained for and agreed to as
independent consideration for Buyers exclusive right to purchase the Acquired
Assets and for Sellers execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

1.8 **_Non-Assignment of Certain Acquired Assets_**. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or sell any Acquired Asset if an attempted
assignment thereof without consent would violate any right of any Third Party
or any Law or Permit, and no breach of this Agreement shall have occurred by
virtue of such non-assignment. If any Acquired Asset is not assigned at
Closing as a consequence of this _Section 1.8_, then such Acquired Asset
shall be deemed to be an Excluded Asset hereunder at the time of the Closing;
provided that each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into arrangements to provide Buyer with substantially the same economic
claims, rights and benefits of any such asset pursuant to _Section 7.5_, and
with respect to Permits, Seller shall comply with its obligations both before
and after Closing concerning notice and cooperation with Permit transfers. If
any such unobtained consent is subsequently obtained after Closing, then (a)
Seller shall notify Buyer and, as soon as practicable after receipt of such
consent, Seller shall sell, assign and convey the affected Acquired Asset to
Buyer (using the form of Assumed Contracts Assignment or Leased Real Property
and Rights of Way Assignment, as applicable), and (b) the affected Acquired
Asset shall from and after such time be deemed not to be an Excluded Asset.
This _Section 1.8_ shall not limit Buyers condition precedent under _Section
9.2(d)_.

2.6 **_Inventory_**. On the Closing Date, Seller shall sell, or cause one of
its Affiliates to sell, and Buyer will purchase, or cause one of its

Inventory Sale Agreement. The party purchasing the Inventory is hereinafter

Inventory set forth on _Schedule 2.6_, then there will be an " ** _Inventory
Excess_** ".

 



 

(ii) If there is an Inventory Shortage, Seller shall pay Inventory Purchaser
(via wire transfer to an account specified in writing by Inventory Purchaser),

multiplied by the per unit value of such Inventory based on the prices set
forth in _Schedule 2.6_.

 



 

(iii) If there is an Inventory Excess, then Inventory Purchaser shall pay
Seller within five (5) Business Days of the receipt of the reports prepared in
accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_, an amount equal to the Inventory Excess
multiplied by the per unit value of such Inventory based on the prices set
forth in _Schedule 2.6_.

 



 

2.7 **_Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory True-Up_**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree to jointly determine the actual physical volumes and
qualities of Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory at the Terminal Facilities
pursuant to the Inventory Methodology. Promptly following the Effective Time,
the Parties shall compare the actual physical volumes of Third Party
Hydrocarbon Inventory at the Terminal Facilities at Closing with the physical
volumes of crude oil, products and additives owned by Third Parties at the
Terminal Facilities at Closing as such volumes are contractually recorded and
reported in Terminal Facility records after taking into consideration such
Third Partys contractual loss allowance (the " ** _Reported Hydrocarbon
Inventory_** "). If the actual physical volume of Third Party Hydrocarbon
Inventory (after taking into consideration such Third Partys contractual loss
allowance) is less than the volumes of the Reported Hydrocarbon Inventory, or
if any Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory does not meet the required product
specifications, Buyer shall invoice Seller, and Seller shall compensate Buyer,
for any deviations from the Recorded Hydrocarbon Inventory volumes and
specifications, using the prices set forth in _Schedule 2.6_. If the actual
physical volume of Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory (after taking into
consideration such Third Partys share of contractual gains) is greater than
the volumes of the Reported Hydrocarbon Inventory, Seller shall invoice Buyer,
and Buyer shall compensate Seller, for any deviations from the Reported
Hydrocarbon Inventory volumes and specifications, using the prices set forth
in _Schedule 2.6_. For Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory that is off
specification, Sellers maximum liability to Buyer shall be limited to
replacement value of the specific Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory at the
time of the issuance of the report less the salvage value of the off
specification Third Party Hydrocarbon Inventory.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall be responsible for any
contractual obligations regarding gain/loss and/or off specifications pursuant
to the Assumed Contracts, except to the extent constituting Retained
Liabilities.

Seller, Seller has provided to the State of California acting by and through

reasonably acceptable to Seller on the Closing Date.

maintained by Seller in respect of the Acquired Assets may be terminated by
Seller as of the Effective Time. Buyer further agrees not to, and shall
require that none of its Affiliates shall, make any Claims under such
insurance policies, except in accordance with _Section 7.11_. Buyer agrees to
arrange insurance coverage for itself and the Acquired Assets as of the
Effective Time with insurers of its own choice. Buyer further acknowledges
that it has no right, title or interest in any unearned premiums on any
insurance policies maintained by Seller.

 



 

6.7 **_Third Party Software_**. Seller shall not be obligated to procure for
Buyer any rights or benefits under any Intellectual Property licensed from
Third Parties that is used or useful in the operation of any of the Acquired
Assets and the business associated therewith as conducted by Seller prior to
the Closing. Buyer shall be provided access to information concerning the
identity and nature of support provided by Third Party service providers
engaged by Seller to support Sellers information technology infrastructure,
but neither Seller nor Sellers Affiliates shall have any obligation to assist
Buyer to retain the services of such Third Parties, or to obtain such services
at any particular cost. Any fees or expenses associated with the transfer of
any Intellectual Property shall be borne by Buyer, including any transfer fees
or Third Party contractor fees.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF SELLER AND BUYER**

 



 

7.1 **_Expenses_**. Except as explicitly provided otherwise in this Agreement
or by applicable Law, all costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be borne solely and entirely by the Party which has incurred such expenses.

 



 

7.2 **_Injunctions_**. Except as otherwise provided herein, if any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any Party issues or otherwise
promulgates any Order that prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) have such injunction dissolved or otherwise eliminated as
promptly as possible and (b) pursue any underlying Action diligently and in
good faith prior to and after the Closing.

 



 

7.3 **_Payments Received_**. Seller and Buyer agree that after the Closing
they shall hold and promptly transfer and deliver to the other Party, from
time to time as and when received by them, any cash or checks with appropriate
endorsements (using their commercially reasonable efforts not to convert such

receive at or after the Closing which properly belongs to the other Party
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_.

 



 

7.4 **_Permits; Transfers; Cooperation_**. Prior to Closing, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to submit applications, notices and other
information to Governmental Entities that is required to be submitted or
provided by Seller in connection with the transfer to Buyer the rights
existing under the Existing Site Permits and the Post-Closing Consents. From
and after the Effective Date until six (6) months after Closing, Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer and assist Buyer in identifying and obtaining all Permits
(besides Existing Site Permits) necessary for Buyer to own and operate the
Acquired Assets from and after the Closing Date; provided, however, that after

terminations

 



      
 

 



 

or waivers by any Third Party or Governmental Entity. If any such approvals or
Consents are not received as of the Closing, at Buyers request, Seller shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a lawful arrangement
pursuant to which Seller would provide Buyer with substantially the same
economic claims, rights and benefits under the Assumed Contract or Existing
Site Permit. Buyer shall cooperate in good faith, at Sellers expense, with
Seller in any such arrangement. To the extent Buyer is able to so receive the
economic claims, rights and benefits under any such arrangement, Buyer shall
be responsible for the Assumed Liabilities, if any, arising out of or
attributable to such Assumed Contract. Notwithstanding any such arrangement,
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in
obtaining any Required Third Party Consents as quickly as possible following
the Closing.

Department of Justice or a State Attorney General in respect of the HSR Act
filing or related proceeding. Each such Party shall promptly inform the other
Party hereto of any communication (oral or written) to with or from a
Governmental Entity, and provide copies of any written communication to, with
or from, any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings. No Party shall
independently initiate or participate in any meeting or discussion, either in
person, writing or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other
Party prior notice of the meeting and discussion and, unless prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate. The
Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another and jointly determine any
strategies or tactics in connection with obtaining the expiration or
termination of all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, including all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating
to proceedings under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. Neither Party
shall be obligated to share any information that reflects the value of the
transaction or contains attorney-client information or work product absent the
entry of a mutually agreeable joint defense agreement.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts and take any and all
commercially reasonable steps to avoid each and every impediment under the HSR
Act and to resolve any objection or assertion by any Governmental Entity or to
resolve an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or other person,
whether by judicial or administrative action, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transaction or the performance of obligations
hereunder under the Antitrust Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible (and in any event not later than the Initial

7.6 **_Public Announcements_**. Except (a) as set forth on _Schedule 7.6_,
(b) as may be required of such Party or its Affiliates under applicable Law or
stock exchange rules or (c) to the extent necessary for a Party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, neither Party shall issue any press release
or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written approval of the
other Party, not to be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a Party
may make public disclosure as may be necessary or appropriate in connection
with customary presentations, meetings and conference calls with investors and
analysts (in which case the disclosing Party will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to review and
comment on the text of the proposed disclosure prior to making such
disclosure). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.6_,
without the prior written approval of Buyer, Seller shall not issue any press
release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the

7.7 **_Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of that certain
Confidentiality Agreement between Plains Products Terminals LLC and ArcLight
Capital Partners, LLC entered into on September 26, 2017 (the " **
_Confidentiality Agreement_** "). The Parties further agree that the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and all transaction
documents and all communications in connection with the negotiation of the
foregoing shall be deemed "Confidential Information" as such term is defined
in, and subject to, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Effective upon
the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, keep confidential and not
disclose any information to any Person related to the transaction contemplated
herein (including any terms and conditions) or information solely to such
Party, except as may be approved by the other Party (the " ** _Restricted
Information_** "). The obligation to keep such Restricted Information
confidential shall continue for two (2) years from the Closing Date and shall
not apply to any information which (i) is in the public domain as of the
Effective Date, (ii) is published or otherwise becomes part of the public
domain through no fault of the disclosing Party or its Affiliates or (iii)
becomes available to the disclosing Party or its Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a source that did not acquire such information
(directly or indirectly) from the non-disclosing Party or its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may make disclosures as
required by applicable Law or any Governmental Entity and in connection with
disputes hereunder; provided that the Party requested to disclose Restricted
Information, to the extent practicable, shall deliver to the other Party
notice at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the day the disclosing Party
is to disclose any Restricted Information so that the other Party may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 7.7_.

 



      
 

 



 

7.8 **_Further Assurances_**. After the Closing, each Party shall take such
further actions, including obtaining Consents from Third Parties, and execute

Ancillary Agreements and to provide such other Party with the intended
benefits of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

7.9 **_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) _Allocation of Taxes_.

 



 

(i) All Taxes imposed with respect to the Acquired Assets for any Straddle
Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-
Closing Tax Period as follows, in the case of (x) income Taxes (however
denominated), sales and use, value added and withholding Taxes, as though the
taxable year of the applicable Seller terminated at the close of business on
the Closing Date, and (y) all other Taxes, based on the number of days of such
taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days
of such taxable period included in the Post-Closing Tax period. Seller shall
be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that are attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such Taxes that are attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer at Closing Sellers share of the 2017 Property
Taxes or the 2018 Property Taxes, if applicable. To the extent the actual
amount of 2017 Property Taxes is not determinable at Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount
to be paid by Seller at Closing. Upon determination of the actual amount of
2017 Property Taxes or the 2018 Property Taxes, if applicable, Seller shall
pay to Buyer within fifteen (15) days any additional amount necessary to equal
Sellers share of the 2017 Property Taxes or the 2018 Property Taxes, if
applicable; in the event the amount paid by Seller at Closing exceeds Sellers
share of 2017 Property Taxes or the 2018 Property Taxes, if applicable, Buyer
shall refund within fifteen (15) days any such overage to Seller.

 



 

(b) _Refund and Tax Benefits_.

 



 

(i) Any Tax refunds related to the Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities that
are received by Buyer, and any amount credited against Taxes to which Buyer
become entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Period or to the portion of a
Straddle Period that ends on the day before the Closing Date shall be for the
account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the
amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
entitlement thereto.

 



 

(ii) Any Tax refunds related to the Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities
that are received by Seller, and any amount credited against Taxes to which
Seller become entitled, that relate to any Post-Closing Tax Period or to the
portion of a Straddle Period that arises on or after the Closing Date shall be
for the account of Buyer, and Seller shall pay over to Buyer any such refund
or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt or
entitlement thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Tax Assistance_. After the Closing Date, each Party shall provide such
assistance as the other Party may from time to time reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of Tax Returns required to be filed, any audit
or other examination by any taxing authority, any judicial or administrative
proceeding relating to liability for Taxes, or any Claim for refund in respect
of such Taxes or in connection with any litigation and proceedings or
liabilities related to the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities,
including making available employees for interviews, litigation preparation
and testimony. The requesting Party shall reimburse the assisting Party for
the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the assisting Party after
having received the prior written approval therefor from the requesting Party.

 



 

(d) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Buyer shall allocate the Purchase Price and
the Assumed Liabilities treated as purchase price for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as of the Closing, among the classes of assets (as described in the
Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the Code) to which the
Acquired Assets relate (the " ** _Allocation_** ") in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (or any similar
provision of local or state Tax law) and shall submit the proposed Allocation
to Sellers not later than sixty (60) days after Closing. If, within thirty
(30) days after the receipt of the proposed Allocation, Seller notifies Buyer
in writing that Seller disagrees with the proposed Allocation, then Buyer and
Seller shall attempt in good faith to resolve their disagreement within the
fifteen (15) days following Sellers notification to Buyer of such
disagreement. If Seller does not so notify Buyer within thirty (30) days of
receipt of the proposed Allocation, or upon resolution of the dispute by
Seller and Buyer, the proposed Allocation shall become the final Allocation
(the " ** _Purchase Price Allocation_** "). If Seller and Buyer are unable to
resolve their disagreement within the fifteen (15) days following any such
notification by Seller, the dispute shall be submitted to a mutually agreed
nationally recognized independent accounting firm, for resolution within
fifteen (15) days of such submission, which resolution shall be final, binding
and non-appealable. Each Party shall cooperate fully with the other Party to
facilitate a prompt determination of the Allocation. The fees, costs and
expenses of the valuation firm retained to resolve any dispute with respect to
the Allocation, if applicable, shall be borne equally by Seller, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other. Seller and Buyer shall report consistently with
the Allocation in all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition
Statement) under Section 1060 of the Code, which Buyer and Seller shall timely
file with the IRS, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position in any
Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation unless
required to do so by a (x) change in law occurring after the date of the
determination of the Purchase Price Allocation or (y) final determination as
defined in Section 1313 of the Code. Each of Seller and Buyer agree to
promptly advise each other regarding the existence of any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation related to the Purchase Price Allocation.

 



 

7.10 **_Real Estate Matters_**. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts (without liability to Seller) to cooperate with Buyer in connection
with Buyers efforts (a) to obtain surveys of (which shall be updates of
existing surveys where existing surveys that are less than 3 years old are
available) and survey related information and documentation relating to all
Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property and (b) to obtain title insurance
commitments from Fidelity National Title Insurance Company (the " ** _Title
Company_** ") covering the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property set
forth on _Schedule 7.10_. All costs incurred in connection with the foregoing,
including survey and title insurance costs, shall be borne by Buyer. At
Buyers request, Seller shall execute and deliver to the Title Company such
affidavits,

 



      
 

 



 

certificates and other documentation as are customary and reasonably required
to issue title insurance policies for properties similar to the Owned Property
and the Leased Real Property provided that in no event shall Seller be
required to execute and deliver any such affidavits, certificates and other
documentation to the extent any of the same would subject Seller to any
liabilities to the Title Company that would exceed the liabilities that Seller
would have to the Buyer under and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement with respect to the matters covered therein. Seller agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts (without liability to Seller) to cooperate
with Buyer in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain prior to Closing in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Title Company an
estoppel certificate executed by the Terminal Lessor with respect to the
Terminal Lease.

 



 

7.11 **_Casualty Loss_**.

 



 

(a) If, during the Interim Period, all or any portion of the Acquired Assets
are damaged or destroyed in whole or in part (the portion of the Acquired
Assets so damaged or destroyed, the " ** _Damaged Portion_** "), whether by
fire, theft, vandalism, flood, wind, explosion or other casualty (a " **
_Casualty Event_** "), Seller shall notify Buyer promptly in writing (a " **
_Casualty Event Notice_** ") of the Casualty Event. The Casualty Event Notice
shall include: (i) a reasonable description of the facts and circumstances
surrounding the Casualty Event; (ii) Sellers preliminary assessment of the
effect of the Casualty Event on the Acquired Assets; and (iii) Sellers
preliminary assessment of whether, and the extent to which, any losses
sustained as a result of such Casualty Event are covered by one or more
insurance policies (including property/casualty and workers compensation
policies) maintained immediately prior to the Closing by Seller.

 



 

(b) If: (i) Seller reasonably expects the Damaged Portion resulting from a
Casualty Event can be fully repaired or restored in accordance with applicable
Laws on or before the date that is 180 days following the occurrence of the
Casualty Event (the " ** _Casualty Event Termination Date_** "); and (ii) the
damage due to the Casualty Event is greater than ten percent (10%) of the
Purchase Price, then Buyer may elect, in its sole discretion, to either (A)
repair and restore such Damaged Portion at Buyers expense, and Buyer shall be
entitled to all of the insurance proceeds which Seller or any of its
Affiliates actually receive with respect to such Casualty Event, or (B) notify
Seller that Buyer does not elect to repair and restore such Damaged Portion,
at which time Seller can elect to either (1) repair or restore such Damaged
Portion by the Casualty Event Termination Date, or (2) not repair or restore
such Damaged Portion by the Casualty Event Termination Date. If Seller
reasonably expects the Damaged Portion resulting from a Casualty Event cannot
be fully repaired or restored in accordance with applicable Laws on or before
the Casualty Event Termination Date, then either Party may either (i)
terminate this Agreement or (ii) agree to a mutually acceptable solution
related thereto.

 



 

(c) If, with respect to any Casualty Event greater than ten percent (10%) of
the Purchase Price that Buyer elected not to repair and restore such Damaged
Portion, Seller elects to repair or restore such Damaged Portion by the
Casualty Event Termination Date, then: (i) Seller shall promptly commence and
diligently execute the repair and/or restoration of such Damaged Portion to
the condition thereof immediately prior to such Casualty Event in a good and
workmanlike manner and in accordance with applicable Laws at its sole cost and
expense; (ii) Seller shall be entitled to all of the insurance proceeds with
respect to such Casualty Event;

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) such Casualty Event shall have no effect for purposes of determining
whether Buyers conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 9.1_ or _Section
9.2_ have been fulfilled; and (iv) the Closing and the Termination Date shall
be delayed for such reasonable time as is necessary for Seller to complete any
such repair or restoration.

 



 

(d) If, with respect to any Casualty Event greater than ten percent (10%) of
the Purchase Price that Buyer elected not to repair and restore such Damaged
Portion, Seller elects not to repair or restore such Damaged Portion by the
Casualty Event Termination Date, then Buyer may elect by notice to Seller not
later than fifteen (15) days after Buyers receipt of Sellers election not to
repair or restore such Damaged Portion to either: (A) proceed to Closing, and
(i) neither Partys rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be
affected in any way; (ii) no breach of any representations or warranties under
this Agreement shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of such Casualty
Event; (iii) Seller shall be entitled to all of the insurance proceeds with
respect to such Casualty Event; and (iv) there shall be a reduction in the
amount of ten percent (10%) to the Purchase Price; or (B) elect not to close,
at which time either Party may terminate this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If the Casualty Event is ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price or less,
then: (i) neither Partys rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be
affected in any way; (ii) no breach of any representations or warranties under
this Agreement shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of such Casualty
Event; (iii) Buyer shall be entitled to all of the insurance proceeds with
respect to such Casualty Event; and (iv) there shall be no change to the
Purchase Price.

Seller that, there shall be no major employment losses as a consequence of the

as a consequence of the change in ownership contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer covenants that Buyer shall be responsible for, and Buyer shall indemnify

a result of any employment losses occurring on or after the Closing Date.
Buyer covenants that for ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, there
shall not be any mass layoff, plant closing or other action that might trigger
WARN Obligations of Seller or Sellers Affiliates.

 



 

8.11 **_Severance_**. In the event that the employment of any Transferred
Employee is terminated within one (1) year following the Closing Date (other
than for violation of generally applicable policies of Buyer or other
circumstances reasonably constituting cause), then Buyer shall provide such
Transferred Employee with severance pay and benefits available under the
severance program of Buyer available to similarly situated employees of Buyer,
but in no event shall such severance pay be less than one (1) years salary.

qualifiers included in such representations and warranties). Seller shall have

10.1 **_Termination_**. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 



 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller, upon notice to the other Party, if a
Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken any Action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (other than pursuant to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws)
or the Ancillary Agreements;

 



 

(c) by either Buyer or Seller, upon notice to the other Party, in the event of
a breach by the other Party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement, which (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.2_

 



      
 

 



 

or _Section 9.3_, and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within sixty (60)
days following receipt by the breaching Party of notice of such breach, which
notice shall advise the breaching Party of the nature of the breach; provided,
however, that the Party seeking termination is not in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

(d) by Buyer or Seller, upon notice to the other Party, if the Transactions
shall not have been consummated by January 1, 2018 (the " ** _Initial Outside
Date_** "); provided, that if (i)(A) the conditions set forth in _Sections
9.1(a)_ or _9.1(b)_ are not satisfied as of the Initial Outside Date based
on an Order issued under the Antitrust Laws and Buyer reasonably believes such
condition may be satisfied within ninety (90) Days after the Initial Outside
Date or (B) the condition set forth in _Section 9.1(c)_ has not been
satisfied as of the Initial Outside Date and Buyer reasonably believes it is
capable of being satisfied within ninety (90) Days after the Initial Outside
Date; (ii) the primary cause of the failure of such conditions to be satisfied
by the Initial Outside Date is not a breach by Buyer of any representation or
covenant by Buyer under this Agreement; and (iii) all other conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article IX_ are satisfied or capable of being satisfied
at the Initial Outside Date, then Buyer may elect to extend the Initial
Outside Date by a period of ninety (90) Days by providing notice to Seller on
or before the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Initial Outside Date (the
" ** _Final Outside Date_** "), but in no event shall the Final Outside Date
be extended beyond April 1, 2018;

 



 

(e) by Buyer or Seller, upon notice to the other Party, pursuant to _Section
7.11_; or

 



 

(f) by Seller pursuant to _Section 1.5_.

 



 

10.2 **_Effect of Termination_**.

 



 

(a) Upon any termination of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall be relieved
of their respective duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after
the date of such termination, and, except as provided in this _Section 10.2_,
such termination shall be without liability to Seller or Buyer; provided that
the provisions of this _Section 10.2_, _Section 6.1(b)_, _Section 7.7_ and
_Article XII_ (other than _Section 12.7_), shall survive any such
termination and shall be enforceable hereunder and any defaulting party shall
remain liable under this Agreement for any breach of this Agreement prior to
termination. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by
Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_, then, within 30 days of receipt of
Sellers invoice therefor after such termination, Buyer shall reimburse Seller
for the HSR Expenses.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated due to a Buyer-Risk Termination, then
within three (3) Business Days thereafter the Parties shall execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Deposit to Seller, and
the Deposit shall constitute liquidated damages. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the sole and exclusive remedy of
any member of the Seller Indemnified Parties against Buyer or the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any pre-Closing breach of this Agreement or any
failure of the condition in _Section 9.1(c)_ to be satisfied shall be to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1(c)_ or _10.1(d)_
and receive the Deposit (and be reimbursed for the HSR Expenses, if applicable
in accordance with _Section 10.2(a)_), and no member of the Seller
Indemnified Parties

 



      
 

 



 

shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Claim against Buyer or any of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
any of the Ancillary Agreements, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, except pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 7.7_.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than the reasons set
forth in _Section 10.2(b)_, then within three (3) Business Days thereafter
the Parties shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written
instructions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement instructing the Escrow Agent to
refund to Buyer the Deposit.

 



 

(d) In the event of litigation relating solely to the release of the Deposit,
the non-prevailing Party shall reimburse the prevailing Party for all of the
prevailing Partys out-of-pocket costs and expenses resulting from such
litigation (on appeal or otherwise), including reasonable attorneys fees,
witness fees and court costs.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

11.1 **_Obligations to Indemnify_**.

 



 

(a) _Seller s Obligations_. Subject to the terms of this _Article XI_, from
and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses arising or
resulting from any one or more of the following:

 



 

(i) the Retained Liabilities;

 



 

(ii) the breach, non-fulfillment or non-performance by Seller of any
agreement, obligation or covenant in this Agreement to be performed by Seller
(or its Affiliates) on or prior to Closing;

 



 

(iii) the breach, non-fulfillment or non-performance by Seller of any
agreement, obligation or covenant in this Agreement to be performed by Seller
(or its Affiliates) after Closing; or

 



 

(iv) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in this Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Buyer s Obligation_. Subject to the terms of this _Article XI_, from
and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses arising or
resulting from or in connection with any of the following:

 



 

(i) the Assumed Liabilities;

 



 

(ii) the breach, non-fulfillment or non-performance by Buyer of any agreement,
obligation or covenant of Buyer in this Agreement to be performed by Buyer (or
its Affiliates) on or prior to Closing;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) the breach, non-fulfillment or non-performance by Buyer of any
agreement, obligation or covenant in this Agreement to be performed by Buyer
(or its Affiliates) after Closing;

 



 

(iv) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in this Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date; or

 



 

(v) Buyers or Buyers Representatives access to or inspection of the
Terminal Facilities or travel to or from or presence on the Terminal
Facilities, or any other facilities of Seller or its Affiliates, pursuant to
_Section 6.1_.

 



 

11.2 **_Third Party Claims_**.

 



 

(a) If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the commencement of any Action
or proceeding or the assertion of any Claim by a Third Party or the imposition
of any penalty or assessment for which indemnity may be sought under this
_Article XI_ (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "), and such Indemnified Party
intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article XI_, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly provide the other Party (the " ** _Indemnifying Party_**
") with notice of such Third Party Claim, which notice shall describe such
Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, including all relevant factual
background and the basis on which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of an
Indemnified Party to promptly give notice of a Third Party Claim shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this this _Article
XI_ except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being
available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the
Third Party Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys
ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled, at its option and at its own expense, to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim; except that if Seller is the Indemnifying Party, then
Seller shall not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any Third
Party Claim that (i) is asserted directly or by or on behalf of any Person
that is a supplier or customer with respect to the Acquired Assets or (ii)
seeks an injection or other equitable relief against the Buyer Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the notice under this _Section 11.2(a)_ to notify the Indemnified Party
whether it admits its obligations to provide indemnification in respect of
such Third Party Claim and if so, whether it intends to assume the defense of
the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and
during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that
it deems necessary to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party
and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party timely assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, then such defense
shall be conducted through counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
approved by the Indemnified Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, and the Indemnified Party shall fully
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith, at no cost or
expense to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party fails to timely
assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Third Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the sole
expense, of the Indemnifying Party.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 11.2(a)_, each Indemnified
Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the reasonable attorneys fees of the Indemnified Party if (i) the
employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in writing by any
such Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party
Claim, or (ii) the Indemnified Partys counsel, which counsel shall be
reasonably competent to render advice as to such matters, shall have advised
the Indemnified Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying
Party, that there is a conflict of interest that could make it inappropriate
under applicable standards of professional conduct for the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Parties to have common counsel.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of each
Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of any Third Party Claim or any
liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, any injunctive or other
equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if, in the
reasonable opinion of each Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment could have a material and adverse effect on its
business, operations, assets or financial condition.

 



 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the release by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party
from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.

 



 

11.3 **_Direct Claims_**.

 



 

(a) _Notice of Indemnified Claims_. In any case in which an Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to _Section 11.2_
because no Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any Losses which such Indemnified
Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof (the " **
_Indemnified Claims_** "). Subject to the limitations otherwise set forth in
this _Article XI_, the failure of the Indemnified Party to exercise
promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim
unless the resulting delay materially prejudices the position of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.

 



 

(b) _Contested Claims_. Each Indemnified Claim shall (i) reference the
indemnity claim to which it relates and shall state the date upon which such
indemnity claim was first asserted; (ii) describe the nature of the Losses
incurred by the Indemnified Party; (iii) describe the reason why the Losses
are recoverable from the Indemnified Party; (iv) state the amount of the
Losses; and (v) provide copies of all available documentation supporting the
amount of the Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
following receipt of an Indemnified Claim to review such claim (the " **
_Review Period_** "). The Indemnified Party shall make a Representative
reasonably available during the Review Period to respond to any questions by
the Indemnifying Party concerning the Indemnified Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party objects to all or any portion of the Indemnified Claim (an " **
_Objection_** "), the Indemnifying Party shall deliver its Objection in
writing to the Indemnified Party within the Review Period.

 



      
 

 



 

Each such Objection shall state (A) if applicable, why the Indemnified Claim
is not recoverable from the Indemnifying Party; (B) the amount of Losses
objected to by the Indemnifying Party; and (C) if applicable, the amount of
the Losses not objected to by the Indemnifying Party (the " ** _Uncontested
Amount_** ").

 



 

(c) _Uncontested Claims_. If the Indemnifying Party fails to tender an
Objection within the Review Period, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly (but
in any event within five (5) days after expiration of the Review Period)
tender payment to the Indemnified Party in the amount of the Indemnified Claim
in accordance with _Section 11.7_. Upon the Indemnified Partys receipt of
any Objection, the Uncontested Amount, if any, shall promptly (but in any
event within five (5) days after such receipt) be tendered by the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with _Section 11.7_.

 



 

11.4 **_Limits of Liability_**.

 



 

(a) _Deductible; Cap_. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be
indemnified for Losses pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ unless and until,
and then only to the extent that, the respective aggregate amount of all such
Losses by such Buyer Indemnified Party exceeds three percent (3.0)% of the
Purchase Price (the " ** _Deductible_** ") other than with respect to Losses
related to any breach of Sellers Fundamental Representations or Sellers
representations and warranties in _Section 3.7_ ( _Taxes_ ). The Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be paid the entire amount of any
Losses pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ in excess of the Deductible;
provided, however, that the aggregate liability of Seller for Losses under
_Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ shall not exceed fifteen percent (15.0%) of the
Purchase Price other than with respect to Losses related to any breach of
Sellers Fundamental Representations or Sellers representations and
warranties in _Section 3.7_ ( _Taxes_ ), or one hundred percent (100)% of the
Purchase Price related to any breach of Sellers Fundamental Representations
(the " ** _Cap_** ").

 



 

(b) _Minimum Claim_. If any single claim or group of related claims for
indemnification by a Buyer Indemnified Party that is subject to indemnity
under _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_ of this Agreement results in respective aggregate
Losses to such Buyer Indemnified Party that do not exceed $500,000, such
Losses shall not be deemed to be Losses under this Agreement and shall not be
eligible for indemnification under this _Article XI_. This _Section 11.4(b)_
shall not apply to Losses in respect of Sellers Fundamental Representations
or Taxes.

 



 

(c) _No Special Damages_. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be liable
to any Indemnified Party with respect to any matter arising under or in
relation to this Agreement for any consequential, punitive, exemplary,
incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages, which may include loss of
future revenue, income or profits, diminution of value or loss of business
reputation or opportunity or a multiple of revenue, income, profits or any
other amount, except to the extent such damages are included within a judgment
rendered against an Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Claim for
which indemnification is available under the terms of this _Article XI_.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) _Mitigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties
shall have a duty to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) _Insurance_. In determining the amount of any Losses for which a Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article XI_, the amount of such
Losses shall be reduced by all insurance proceeds or other Third Party
recoveries.

 



 

11.5 **_Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties_**.

 



 

(a) _Survival; Claims Period_.

 



 

(i) Covenants contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements shall
survive the Closing and shall continue thereafter until fully performed. The
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and shall continue thereafter notwithstanding such Closing or any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Party entitled to the benefit
thereof or any Knowledge of such Party and shall terminate on the date that is
the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " ** _Expiration Date_** ");
provided, however, that (a) Sellers Fundamental Representations shall survive
indefinitely and (b) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.7_ ( _Taxes_ ) shall survive the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extensions thereof) for a period of sixty (60)
days. Any Claim by a Party in respect of such representations and warranties
must be made in writing prior to the Expiration Date and must set forth in
reasonable detail the facts alleged to give rise to such Claim.

 



 

(ii) No action for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein shall be brought after the Expiration Date, except
for claims of which a Party has received notice setting forth in reasonable
detail the claimed misrepresentation or breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement with reasonable detail, prior to the Expiration Date.

 



 

11.6 **_Exclusive Remedy_**. After the Closing, except in the case of fraud or
willful misconduct, the provisions of this _Article XI_ shall be the
exclusive basis for assertion of claims against, or the imposition of
liability on, any Party by another Party with respect to any breach of, or
other failure to meet any obligation under, this Agreement.

 



 

11.7 **_Payments_**. All payments to be made by an Indemnifying Party to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Indemnified Party.

 



 

11.8 **_Administration of Indemnity Claims_**. Notwithstanding anything else
in this _Article XI_, any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article
XI_, whether for a Third Party Claim pursuant to _Section 11.2_ or a direct
claim pursuant to _Section 11.3_, (a) on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Party
must be made and administered by Buyer, or its successors or assigns as
permitted herein, and (b) on behalf of a Seller Indemnified Party must be made
and administered by Seller, or its successors and assigns as permitted herein.

 



      
 

 



 

11.9 **_Tax Treatment_**. The Parties agree to treat, for Tax purposes, any
indemnification payments under this _Article XI_ as adjustments to the
Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by a change in law occurring after
the date hereof, a closing agreement with an applicable Taxing Authority or a
final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
