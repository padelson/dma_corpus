such disagreement in writing within twenty (20) days after its receipt of the
NWC Statement, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
particulars of such disagreement. In the event that Seller does not provide
such a notice of disagreement within such twenty (20) day period, Seller shall
be deemed to have accepted the NWC Statement and the calculation of the
Preliminary Closing Net Working Capital Amount delivered by Purchaser, and
such Preliminary Closing Net Working Capital Amount shall be deemed the "
_Closing Net Working Capital Amount_ " for purposes of this Agreement. In the
event any such notice of disagreement is timely provided by Seller, Purchaser
and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
twenty (20) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve
any disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then an independent accounting firm of recognized 

 



16  national standing as may be mutually selected by Purchaser and Seller (the "
_Auditor_ ") shall resolve any remaining disagreements. If Purchaser and
Seller cannot mutually agree on the choice of the Auditor, then Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller a list of three independent accounting firms of
national standing in the United States and Seller shall select one of such
three accounting firms to act as the Auditor. The Auditor shall determine the
Net Working Capital Amount as of the TBA Effective Date as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within fifteen (15) days after the date on which
such dispute is referred to the Auditor, based solely on written submissions
forwarded by Purchaser and Seller to the Auditor within ten (10) days
following the Auditors selection, and such amount, which shall be equal to or
between Sellers and Purchasers calculations of Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, in the aggregate, shall be deemed the " _Closing Net Working Capital
Amount_ " for purposes of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Auditor
shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller. The determination
of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The date
on which the Closing Net Working Capital Amount is finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.06(c)_ is referred as to the "
_Determination Date_."

(d) _Net Working Capital Payments_.

 

(i) In the event the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is a positive
number, Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer in immediately available funds,
to Seller an amount equal to the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount in three
(3) equal installments (the " _Interim Net Working Capital Payments_ "), with
one installment payable on the date that is (i) thirty (30) days, (ii) sixty
(60) days, and (iii) ninety (90) days, respectively, after the TBA Effective
Date; _provided_ , that if any such date is not a Business Day, Purchaser
shall pay the relevant Interim Net Working Capital Payment on the first
Business Day immediately following such date. In the event the Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount is a negative number, Seller shall pay, by wire
transfer in immediately available funds, to Purchaser the Interim Net Working
Capital Payments, with one installment payable on the date that is (i) thirty
(30) days, (ii) sixty (60) days, and (iii) ninety (90) days, respectively,
after the TBA Effective Date; _provided_ , that if any such date is not a
Business Day, Seller shall pay the relevant Interim Net Working Capital
Payment on the first Business Day immediately following such date.

 

(ii) The " _Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or
negative, shall mean the difference between (A) the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount and (B) the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount.

(iii) On the later of (A) the Determination Date, or (B) the day that is
ninety-one (91) days after the TBA Effective Date, (1) if the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount is positive, then within five (5) days after
the Determination Date, Purchaser shall pay, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds, to Seller the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, and (2)
if Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is negative, then within five (5)
days after the Determination Date, Seller shall pay, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, to Purchaser the Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount.

 



17 SECTION 2.07. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) Not more than ten (10) nor less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a reasonably detailed
estimate, prepared in good faith and in accordance with the accounting
policies, principles, practices and methodologies used in the preparation of
the Financial Statements, of the Retained Liabilities as of the Closing Date
(the " _Retained Liabilities Statement_ ").

(b) Upon delivery of the Retained Liabilities Statement, to the extent in
the possession or control of Seller, Seller will provide to Purchaser and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the books and records of Seller, to the extent
reasonably related to its evaluation of the Retained Liabilities Statement,
and shall cause the employees of Seller to cooperate with Purchaser and its
Representatives in connection with Purchasers review of the Retained
Liabilities Statement and other documents and information relating to
Sellers calculation of the Retained Liabilities as Purchaser may request. If
Purchaser shall disagree with the calculation of the Retained Liabilities or
any element of the Retained Liabilities Statement relevant thereto, it shall
notify Seller of such disagreement in writing within sixty (60) days after its
receipt of the Retained Liabilities Statement, which notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement. In the event that
Purchaser does not provide such a notice of disagreement within such sixty
(60) day period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Retained
Liabilities Statement and the calculation of the Retained Liabilities
delivered by Seller, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder. In the event a notice of disagreement is timely provided
by Purchaser, Purchaser and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts for a period of twenty (20) days (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation
of the Retained Liabilities. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to
resolve such disagreements, then an Auditor shall resolve any remaining
disagreements. If Purchaser and Seller cannot mutually agree on the choice of
the Auditor, then Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a list of three
independent accounting firms of national standing in the United States
and Seller shall select one of such three accounting firms to act as the
Auditor. The Auditor shall determine the Retained Liabilities as of the
Closing Date as promptly as practicable, but in any event within fifteen (15)
days after the date on which such dispute is referred to the Auditor, based
solely on written submissions forwarded by Purchaser and Seller to the Auditor
within ten (10) days following the Auditors selection, and such Retained
Liabilities amount, which shall be equal to or between Sellers and
Purchasers calculations with respect to the Retained Liabilities, in the
aggregate, shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder.
The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and
one-half by Seller.

(c) Within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of the
Retained Liabilities in accordance with this _Section 2.07_, (i) in the
event that the Final Retained Liabilities Amount exceeds the Preliminary
Retained Liabilities Amount, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such
excess in cash or immediately available funds, and (ii) in the event that the
Preliminary Retained Liabilities Amount exceeds the Final Retained Liabilities
Amount, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such excess in cash or
immediately available funds. The " _Final Retained Liabilities Amount_ "
means an amount equal to the Retained Liabilities as finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.07_.

 



18 SECTION 2.08. _Withholding_. Any party shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payments made pursuant to this Agreement any amounts
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of any such
payment under applicable Tax Law at the applicable rate for such withholding,
and shall timely remit any such withheld amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Authority as required by applicable Law, unless, with respect to
a certain payment, the payee provides the payor with a valid exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax in respect of such payment at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date of such payment. Any amounts deducted and
withheld and timely remitted pursuant to this _Section 2.08_ shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made.

the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed in all other
applicable sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
relevant to another section of this Agreement or of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Seller Disclosure

documents and certificates to be executed and delivered by Seller
in connection herewith, including the TBA and the Registration Rights
Agreement (the " _Ancillary Documents_ "), to carry out its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Seller is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction which the properties owned or leased
by it or the operation of its business makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents by Seller, the performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder
and thereunder and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the
part of Seller, including its board of directors and applicable shareholders

respective terms, except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ "). No further act or

which are necessary for the continued operation of the Stations as currently
conducted. One of the Companies owns, leases or has the legal and recorded
right to use in the ordinary course of business all easements, rights of entry
and rights-of-way which are material to the business and operations of the
Stations. There are no material structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing,
air conditioning, heating or other defects in the Real Property that
materially adversely affect the operation of the Stations,

 



26  and all of the buildings, fixtures and improvements located on the Real
Property are in good condition and repair (normal wear and tear excepted),
adequate to operate such facilities as currently used, are suitable for the
current operation of the Stations and no condition exists that would interfere
with the Companies customary use and operation thereof in any material
respect.

 

(d) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.12(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_, there are no parties in possession of any portion of the Real
Property other than the Companies, whether as lessees, tenants at will,
trespassers or otherwise, and no Company, nor, to the Sellers Knowledge, any
other Person has granted any oral or written right to any Person other than
the Companies to Lease the Owned Real Property. There are no options or
rights in any third party to purchase or acquire any ownership interest in the
Owned Real Property, including pursuant to any executory contracts of sale,
rights of first refusal or options.

(e) Each parcel of Owned Real Property is properly and duly zoned for its
current use, and such current use is a conforming use and does not violate
any restrictive covenants affecting or encumbering the Owned Real Property,
and no zoning, subdivision, building, health, land use, fire or other federal,
state or municipal Law is violated by the continued maintenance, operation,
use or occupancy of the Owned Real Property or any tract or portion thereof or
interest therein in its present manner, except for such violations that are
not material.

 

(f) All utilities required in connection with the use, occupancy and operation
of each parcel of Real Property are sufficient for its present purposes and
are fully operational and in working order in all material respects.

(g) Neither Seller nor any of the Companies has received any written notice
of any assessments, general or special, that have been or are in the process
of being levied against any parcel of Real Property, and to Sellers
Knowledge, there are no threatened or contemplated assessments.

 

(h) The following are included in the Assets: (i) with respect to Owned Real
Property and Leased Real Property pursuant to a ground lease, the antenna
support structures, including any guy anchors and guy wires, used or useful in
connection with the operation of the Stations (" _Towers_ "), buildings
(including transmitter buildings) and other structures and improvements used
or useful in connection with the operation of the Stations (collectively, "
_Transmission Structures_ "), (ii) Transmission Equipment, and (iii) other
tangible assets and property. The Companies have, and upon the Closing
Purchaser shall continue to have, full legal and practical access to Real
Property in all material respects, and each parcel of Real Property is
accessible without charge by a public right of way or is otherwise
reasonably accessible for purposes of conducting the use of each such
property, as currently conducted, including reasonable access between and
among each transmitter building, the Tower corresponding thereto and, if
applicable, each guy anchor supporting each such Tower. In all material
respects, all ingress and egress to, from, between and among the transmitter
building, the Tower corresponding thereto and, if applicable, each guy anchor
supporting each such Tower are located entirely on the Real Property;
_provided_ , that to the extent that any transmitter building, Tower or, if
applicable, guy anchor supporting any Tower is located on an easement
comprising

 



27  the Real Property, such easement (and the corresponding transmitter
building, Tower, or guy anchor thereon) is identified and described in
_Section 3.12(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. None of the
Transmission Structures or the use thereof violates in any material respect
any restrictive covenants or encroaches on any property owned by any other
Person, and all such Transmission Structures are constructed in conformity
with all applicable "set-back" lines, easements and other restrictions or
rights of record in all material respects.

 

(i) With respect to Owned Real Property, except as described in _Section
3.12(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, no condemnation or eminent domain
proceeding is pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened which could
reasonably be expected to preclude or impair the use of any Owned Real
Property by the Stations. With respect to Leased Real Property, to
Sellers Knowledge, no condemnation or eminent domain proceeding is pending
or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened which could reasonably be expected to
preclude or impair in any way the use of any Leased Real Property by the
Stations.

former employee, officer or director of any of the Companies. _Section
3.13(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ identifies each Plan that is solely
maintained or sponsored by any of the Companies (each, a " _Company Plan_ ");
_provided_ , that with respect to employment agreements, _Section 3.13(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ is only required to include employment
agreements with total annual compensation payments in excess of $200,000.
Seller has made available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each
Company Plan (including any amendment) and, if applicable, related trust
agreements, annuity contracts, insurance contracts, summary plan

Schedule_, all benefits, contributions and premiums required by and due under
the terms of each Company Plan or applicable Law have been timely paid in

yet due, have been properly accrued.

(d) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable determination
or opinion letter from the IRS on which it is entitled to rely covering all of
the provisions applicable to the Plan for which determination or opinion
letters are currently available that the Plan is so qualified and each trust
established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt. To Sellers
Knowledge, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the
revocation of such determination letter from the IRS or the unavailability of
reliance on such opinion letter from the IRS, as applicable.

 

(e) No Plan: (i) is subject to Title IV of ERISA or the minimum funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) is a

Company under Section 4069 or Section 4212(c) of ERISA; and to Sellers
Knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material risk to any Company of
incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA.

 

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(f) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ and other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or other
applicable Law, no Company Plan provides benefits or coverage in the nature of
health, life or disability insurance following retirement or other termination
of employment (other than death benefits when termination occurs upon death).

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(g) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any employee, director, or
independent contractor of a Company to severance pay or any material increase
in severance pay (other than severance pay required by any Law) for which
Purchaser or any of the Companies will be liable, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation due to
any such employee, director, or independent contractor, or (iii) result in
the payment of any amount that could, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined
in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

Authority, except for such of the foregoing as are necessary pursuant to the
Communications Act and the HSR Act, except, in the case of clauses (b), (c)
and (e), as would not reasonably be expected to (i) adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of Purchaser and Parent to carry out their
obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents or (ii) have a Purchaser MAE.

SECTION 4.04. _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents by Purchaser and
Parent, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, and the performance by Purchaser and Parent of their
respective obligations hereunder and thereunder do not and will not require
any consent, approval, authorization or other order of, Action by, filing or
registration with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (a)
as described in  _Section 4.04 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_, or (b)
the Government Consents.

SECTION 4.05. _Investment Purpose_. Purchaser is acquiring the Shares solely
for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof, and in compliance with all
applicable Laws, including United States federal securities Laws. Purchaser
agrees that the Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities Laws, except pursuant to
an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and such Laws.
Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of holding the Shares for an
indefinite period (including total loss of its investment), and (either alone
or together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risk of its investment. Purchaser (a) has had reasonable opportunity to
ask questions of and receive answers from Seller concerning the acquisition
of the Shares, (b) has been permitted access, to Purchasers satisfaction, to
any information or data regarding Seller that it has requested, and (c)
understands that the acquisition of the Shares is subject to risks and
acknowledges that it fully understands such risks.

SECTION 4.06. _Compliance with Laws; Litigation_.

(a) No Action by or against Purchaser, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser or Parent, threatened, which would
be reasonably expected to result in a Purchaser MAE or have a material adverse
impact on the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. None of
Purchaser, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is subject to any material
judgment, writ, injunction, settlement agreement, order or decree entered in
any lawsuit or proceeding. There is no Governmental Order outstanding against
Purchaser, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective assets
that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Purchaser MAE. None of Purchaser, Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary has received any written notification of, and to
Purchasers and

 



37  Parents Knowledge there is no, investigation by any Governmental Authority
involving any of them or any of their respective assets that, individually or
in the aggregate, have resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in
a Purchaser MAE.

(b) None of Purchaser, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is in violation of,
and for the past three (3) years, none of Purchaser, Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary has been given written or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser and
Parent, oral notice of or been charged with any violation of, any Law or
Governmental Order applicable to any of them or any of their respective
assets and properties by, or investigation, audit or review with respect to,
any of them, except for such violations, investigations, audits or reviews
that have not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, result in material liability to Purchaser or Parent or otherwise
interfere in any material respect with the conduct of their respective
businesses as currently conducted or result in any criminal or quasi-
criminal Action.

(c) Each of Purchaser, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries possesses all
Permits required under applicable Law or necessary to conduct its business in
all material respects as presently conducted and is in compliance in all
material respects with the terms of the Permits, and no event has occurred
which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would cause any of them
not to be in compliance in all material respects with, or would allow
revocation or termination of, or would result in any other material impairment
of the rights of the holder of, any such Permit. None of Purchaser, Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary has received written or, to Purchasers and Parents
Knowledge, oral notice claiming that any Permit may be terminated, revoked,
suspended, limited or modified or may not be renewed except where such
revocation, suspension, modification or limitation has not resulted, and
would not reasonably be expected to result in, material liability to the
business of Parent and its subsidiaries or otherwise materially interfere with
the conduct of the business of Parent and its subsidiaries in substantially
the manner currently conducted.

the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_, Purchaser and Parent are legally,
financially and otherwise qualified to acquire the Shares and to own each of
the Companies and to control and operate the Stations under the Communications
Act and the FCC Rules, and there are no facts that would, under existing Law,
including the FCC Rules, disqualify Purchaser as transferee of control of the
FCC Licenses. Except as set forth on _Section 4.07 of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule_, neither Purchaser nor Parent is required to obtain any
waiver of or exemption from any FCC Rule for the FCC Consent to be obtained.
Except as set forth in _Section 4.07 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_,

operate the Stations and otherwise conduct its business following Closing.

modified or amended since the time of filing, as of the date of such
supplement, modification or amendment (and at the time of effectiveness, in
the case of registration statements, and at the time of the applicable
shareholder meeting, in the case of proxy statements), the Parent SEC
Documents (i) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, and (ii) complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as

material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared from the books and records of Parent

controls that comply with Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and are

to any difference. Parents principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation prior
to the date hereof, to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of
Parents board of directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,

role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting.

currently existing as of the date hereof that would reasonably be expected
to result in such Liability.

SECTION 4.13. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Reference Statement
Date, through the date of this Agreement, there has not been any Purchaser
MAE or any event(s), circumstance(s), change(s), or effect(s) which have had

hours, under the supervision of Sellers personnel and in such a manner as not
to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Business.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not

in Sellers reasonable discretion, (a) jeopardize any attorney-client or other
legal privilege, or (b) contravene any applicable Law (including the HSR

44  restricted, such as by designating certain portions of such information as

pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ shall remain subject in all respects to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or against or
incurred by any party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives after the

SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The terms of the letter agreement dated as of September 7, 2014, as
amended September 15, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between
Seller and Purchaser are hereby incorporated by reference and shall continue
in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality
Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this  _Section 5.03_ shall
terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect.

 

(b) Nothing provided to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.02_ shall in any way
amend or diminish Purchasers obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any information provided to
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 5.02_ or otherwise by Seller, the Companies or
any officer, director, employee, agent, Representative, accountant or counsel
thereof shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , that neither the foregoing nor anything in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit Purchaser or its Affiliates from (i)
engaging in discussions with one (1) or more potential acquirers of one (1) or
more of the Stations during the term of the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that upon Sellers request, Purchaser shall furnish a list of
the parties with which it has disclosed Confidential Information in connection
with such discussions, or (ii) sharing Confidential Information relating to
such Station(s) with such potential acquirer(s), it being agreed that such
potential acquirer(s) shall be deemed a "Representative" of Purchaser under
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



45 (c) From and after the Closing, Seller shall treat and hold as confidential
all of the Confidential Information and refrain from disclosing or using any
of the Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement or to
its Representatives who have a need to know to such Confidential Information
and who agree to hold such information as confidential. In the event that
Seller is requested or required (by oral question or request for information
or documents in any Action or by any Governmental Authority) to disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller shall, to the extent legally permissible,
notify Purchaser promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchaser may
seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions
of this _Section 5.03(c)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller is, on the advice of counsel, compelled
to disclose any Confidential Information to any Governmental Authority, Seller
may disclose the Confidential Information to such Governmental Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at the reasonable request of Purchaser and at Purchasers
expense, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Purchaser shall designate. Upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and Representatives to deliver promptly to Purchaser, at the request and
option of the Purchaser, all tangible embodiments (and copies thereof), of
such Confidential Information which are in Sellers possession or under
Sellers control with respect to which copies are not already in the
possession of the Companies, and shall destroy all other Confidential
Information, _provided_ , that neither Seller nor its Affiliates or
Representatives shall be required to destroy any routine backup tapes
or systems, and each shall be permitted to retain copies of the Confidential
Information included in non-Company board materials, included in this
Agreement (including the schedules, exhibits and related agreements) or
retained solely for compliance purposes or purposes of fulfilling its
obligations hereunder, provided that they shall continue to maintain the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information as provided herein.

 

SECTION 5.04. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities and officials that are necessary or advisable for its
performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and will cooperate with each other
in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall
make any required filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the United
States Department of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (including a request for early termination of
the waiting period thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all
requests received from such agencies for additional information or
documentation and shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly cause the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act. 

(b) Purchaser and Seller each shall oppose any petitions to deny or other
objections filed with respect to the FCC Applications, the Divestiture
Application or any of them, to the extent such petition or objection relates
to such party. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall take any intentional action
that would, or intentionally fail to take such action the failure of which to
take would, reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially delaying
receipt of the FCC Consent or grant of the Divestiture Application.

 



46 (c) Each party to this Agreement shall, except as prohibited by Law, promptly
notify the other party of any communication it or any of its Affiliates
receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Authority. Neither
party to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless, to the extent permitted by Law, it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such
meeting. The parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully

respect to the Retained Names and Marks, and that any title, interest,
license or other such right or arrangement relating thereto existing prior to
the Closing shall automatically terminate simultaneously with and effective as
of the Closing.

 

(b) Purchaser shall, promptly and within ten (10) days following the Closing,
cause each of the Companies to file amended articles of incorporation with
the appropriate authorities changing their corporate names to corporate names
that do not contain any Retained Names and Marks and to promptly supply copies

not be deemed to have violated this _Section 5.05_ by 

 



47  reason of (i) the appearance of any Retained Names and Marks in or on any

that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth
in  _Article VIII_ of this Agreement becoming incapable of being satisfied,
_provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing
shall not be deemed to constitute the failure of any condition set forth in 
_Article VIII_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of a condition set
forth in  _Article VIII_ to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, no disclosure made pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ shall be
deemed to amend or supplement the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, for the purposes of

satisfied, (b) either party has the right to terminate this Agreement under
_Article X_, or (c) either party is entitled to indemnification under
_Article IX_.

Real Property (or such other party whose consent is required) has been
obtained, which consent Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain at Purchasers request) the Leased Real Property (the " _Survey_ ").
Purchaser and Parent will indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
Loss arising out of or related to the preparation of any Survey (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall not include Loss related to matters disclosed
therein), including any claim asserted by the owner of any Leased Real
Property, except to the extent of the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Seller Indemnified Parties or any owner of any Leased Property.

 

(c) The parties understand and agree that the procedures outlined in this
_Section 5.10_ shall in no event delay the Closing or affect the conditions
to Closing set forth in this Agreement, shall in no way affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller set forth in

Assets prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to review drafts of all agreements pursuant to which
Seller will dispose of such Retained Assets, and shall incorporate any
comments reasonably requested by Purchaser. Any sale, transfer or assignment
of the Retained Assets prior to the Closing Date shall be made at the sole
cost and expense of Seller (including any Taxes incurred in connection with

which if Purchaser so elects shall contemplate the assignment effective as of

owned subsidiaries of Purchaser; _provided_ , that such process would not
reasonably be expected to delay the grant of the FCC Consent. Purchaser shall,
and Seller shall cause the Companies to, diligently prosecute the FCC
Applications, and otherwise use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the
FCC Consent as promptly as possible. The FCC Applications shall include all
necessary applications with the FCC and any other applicable Governmental

disclose the intention to enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge,
short-sale or other arrangement, without, in each case, the prior written
consent of Parent; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the
foregoing shall not prohibit Seller from selling any Securities received upon
the conversion of or in exchange for shares of Preferred Stock (subject to
the following sentence), and (ii) the foregoing shall not prohibit Sellers
Affiliates from engaging in such aforementioned transactions or other
transactions involving securities of Parent in the ordinary course of their
insurance, advisory and other financial services businesses.

SECTION 7.02. _Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

prepared (at Sellers expense) and timely file the U.S. federal consolidated
income Tax Return for the Affiliated Group and any other Combined Returns for
all taxable periods of the Companies and shall pay all Taxes due with respect
thereto. The parties agree that the Companies shall be treated as if they
ceased to be part of the Affiliated Group, and any other group for which a
Combined Return is filed, as of the end of the day on the Closing Date. With
respect to any short-year Tax Return required to be filed as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree to use a closing of the books method to allocate Tax items of the
Companies between the short-year ending on the Closing Date and the short-year
that begins after the Closing Date, and none of Seller, Purchaser, or any of
their respective Affiliates will make a ratable allocation election under
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any corresponding or similar
state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement to the extent such election is permissible. To the extent
required by Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and any corresponding
or similar state, local or foreign Law), any extraordinary transaction that
occurs on the Closing Date after the Closing shall be treated as occurring on
the day after the Closing Date. Seller or its Affiliate shall provide
Purchaser with copies of the separate company pro-forma portion of all such
Tax Returns relating to the Companies within ten (10) Business Days after
filing any such Tax Returns.

(b) _Separate Company Returns_. Seller or its Affiliate shall prepare or
cause to be prepared (at Sellers expense) any other Tax Returns of the
Companies required to be filed after the Closing Date for any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay

 



54  all Taxes due with respect thereto. If a Company is permitted under
applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period
in which the Closing occurs, Seller and Purchaser shall treat (and cause
their respective Affiliates to treat) the Closing Date as the last day of such
taxable period. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with the
past practices of the applicable Company, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law. Seller shall provide a draft of each such Tax Return to
Purchaser for its review and comment a reasonable time, and no later than
twenty (20) Business Days for any income Tax Return, prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return (including any applicable extensions). Seller shall in
good faith consider all reasonable comments received from Purchaser in writing
no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return, including any applicable extensions. Seller shall deliver the final
Tax Return to Purchaser, together with an amount equal to the Taxes shown as
due thereon, no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the due date
thereof, and Purchaser shall timely file each such Tax Return and timely pay
all Taxes shown as due thereon. No such Tax Return shall be filed without
Purchasers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) _Straddle Period Returns and Taxes_.

 

(i) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared (at Purchasers expense)
all Tax Returns of the Companies for all Straddle Periods (other than any
Combined Returns described in _Section 7.02(a)_). All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared consistent with the past practices of the applicable Company,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall provide a
copy of each such Tax Return (accompanied, where appropriate, by an allocation
between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period of the
Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return) to Seller for its review, comment
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) a reasonable time, and no later than twenty (20) Business Days for
any income Tax Return, prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(including any applicable extensions). Purchaser shall incorporate all
reasonable comments received from Seller in writing no later than five (5)
Business Days before the due date of such Tax Return, including any applicable
extensions. Purchaser shall timely file each such Tax Return and, subject to
the other provisions in this Agreement, timely pay all Taxes shown as due
thereon. Seller shall pay to Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return the amount of Taxes
owing with respect to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date as determined pursuant to _Section 7.02(c)(ii)_.

 

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, including _Article IX_ , in the case of
Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any
such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed equal
to (A) in the case of real or personal property Taxes or other similar Taxes
imposed on an ad valorem basis, the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period, (B) in the case
of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or long-
term debt) or intangibles, a proportionate amount of such Taxes computed by
reference to the level of such items on the Closing Date and the timing of the
Closing Date in relation to the relevant Straddle Period, and (C) in the case
of any other Taxes, the amount of Taxes that would be payable based on an
interim closing of the

 



55  books of the applicable Company as of the end of the day on the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (such as depreciation) shall be apportioned on
a pro rata basis. All determinations necessary to effect the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
applicable Company, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements; Amendments_. All Tax sharing, allocation or other
similar agreements or arrangements to which any Company is a party shall be
terminated effective prior to or as of the Closing. Neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall file any amended Tax Return for any Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without Purchasers consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such filing reasonably could
be expected to increase the Liability of Purchaser or any Company for Taxes in
a Post-Closing Tax Period. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Companies after the Closing Date) shall file any amended Tax
Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without Sellers written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(e) _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Except as provided with respect to refunds
of Transfer Taxes, any refund or credit resulting from overpayment of any
Excluded Taxes or any Taxes (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto) relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the property of
Seller, and if received by Purchaser or the Companies after the Closing Date,
shall be paid over promptly to Seller; _provided_ , that any refund or credit
resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated
based upon the method employed in _Section 7.02(c)(ii)_ taking into account
the type of Tax to which the refund relates. If any such refund is paid over
to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.02(e) and is subsequently revoked,
rescinded or otherwise required to be repaid to the relevant Governmental
Authority, Seller shall repay the amount of such refund that is required to
be repaid to the relevant Governmental Authority to Purchaser within fifteen
(15) Business Days after demand therefor. Purchaser shall, at Sellers
reasonable request and at Sellers expense, cause the Companies or other
relevant entity to file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the receipt of any refund to which Seller is entitled under this _Section
7.02(e)_. Purchaser shall permit Seller to participate in (at Sellers
expense) the prosecution of any such refund claim. Neither Purchaser nor any
of the Companies shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Tax Law,
carryback to a Pre-Closing Tax Period any item of loss, deduction or credit
or any net operating loss, net capital loss or other tax credit or benefit
that is attributable to, arises from or relates to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) commencing after the Closing Date.

 

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
Purchasers acquisition of the Shares shall be borne one-half by Seller and
one-half by Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely
preparing and filing all Tax Returns and other documentation required to be
filed in connection with such Transfer Taxes. Seller shall cause all
appropriate stock Transfer Tax stamps to be affixed to the certificate or
certificates representing the Shares sold and delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. To the extent a party pays any Transfer Tax in excess of the amount
for which it is liable under this  _Section 7.02(f)_, the party responsible
for such excess amount shall reimburse the other party for such amount within
fifteen (15) Business Days of delivery to the responsible party of evidence

be required) to effect and preserve the Section 338 Elections in accordance
with Regulations Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of

the ultimate discretion and authority with respect to the Appraisal. Purchaser
shall deliver a copy of the Appraisal to Seller upon completion. Within

59  days following the later of Determination Date or the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth (i) a
determination of the ADSP (as defined in the applicable Regulations under
Section 338 of the Code) for each Company, and (ii) an allocation of the ADSP
of each Company among the assets of the Company, which shall be prepared in
accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Regulations
promulgated thereunder and based on the Appraisal (the " _Proposed Allocation
Schedule_ "). Seller shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of the
Proposed Allocation Schedule to provide written notice to Purchaser of any
good faith objection to any portion of the Proposed Allocation Schedule, which
objection shall be set forth with reasonable detail in such notice. Unless
Seller timely delivers notice of an objection to the Proposed
Allocation Schedule, Seller shall be deemed to accept and approve the
Proposed Allocation Schedule, which shall thereafter be final and binding upon
the parties.

 

(d) Following receipt of any timely notice of any objection to the Proposed
Allocation Schedule, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve their
disagreement and arrive at a mutually agreed allocation. If the parties are
unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days following notice by Seller
to Purchaser of an objection to the Proposed Allocation Schedule, then
any unresolved disputed matters shall be submitted to the Auditor for final
determination in a manner consistent with _Section 2.06(c)_. The Auditors
resolution of the disputed matters shall be final and binding on the parties.

 

(e) The Proposed Allocation Schedule as accepted (or deemed accepted) pursuant
to _Section 7.05(c)_ or as finally agreed and determined pursuant to
_Section 7.05(d)_ shall become the " _Final Allocation Schedule_ " and the
parties shall file all Tax Returns (including but not limited to IRS Form 8883
and any similar forms required by applicable state and local Law) consistent
with the Final Allocation Schedule and shall not take any position contrary
thereto in connection with any Action relating to Taxes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent Seller or Purchaser
(and their respective Affiliates) from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the
Final Allocation Schedule, and neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required
to litigate before any court, any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority challenging such allocation. If the Purchase Price is
adjusted pursuant to _Section 9.07_, the Final Allocation Schedule shall be
adjusted in a consistent manner.

be conducted by legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , that if (i) the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
a Third Party Claim and thereafter discovers facts as a result of which the
Indemnifying Party, acting reasonably, determines that such information is
likely to mean that the Indemnifying Party does not have an indemnification
obligation in respect of such Third Party Claim, then (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall provide the Indemnified Party written notice of the same
and shall cooperate with the other party to transfer control back to the
Indemnified Party, and shall cooperate in respect of the same, in order to
ensure that such other party is not prejudiced in its defense; _provided_ ,
_further,_ that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume control of
such defense and to settle or compromise any such claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment ( _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not
settle, compromise, consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to or
pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the
Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or unless a final
judgment from which no appeal may be taken is entered against the Indemnified
Party for such Third Party Claim) if the Indemnifying Party failed or is
failing to diligently defend such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to settle, compromise or consent to the entry of a
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment does
not involve any injunctive or non-monetary equitable relief that would be
binding on the Indemnified Party, and contains a complete and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party verifies to the
Indemnified Party in writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be solely
responsible (with no reservation of rights) for the full amount of such
settlement, compromise or judgment. After notice from the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim
or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party
under this _Section 9.05_ for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ counsel to represent it, at its sole cost and expense; _provided_ _, _
_further_ _,_ that if, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party,
based on the advice of counsel, it is advisable for the Indemnified Party to
be represented by separate counsel due to actual or potential conflicts of
interest, then in such event, the reasonable fees and expenses of one such
separate counsel (in addition to one firm of local counsel reasonably
required) shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall each render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of
any such claim or proceeding, including as provided in _Section 5.02(b)_. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or
proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise, consent to the
entry of a judgment with respect to or pay, or permit to be paid, any part of
such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to
such payment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken is
entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such claims or proceeding
pursuant to this _Section 9.05_ and proposes to settle such claims or

 



66  proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo any appeal with
respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right
to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such
claims or proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 9.05_, the Indemnified Party will have the absolute right to
conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (the reasonable fees and
expenses of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article IX_), the defense, compromise and
settlement of any Third Party Claim if (A) such Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party that
poses a reasonable likelihood of resulting in non-monetary relief that would
materially and adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party, (B)
the Third Party Claim is a criminal or quasi criminal Action, (C) the amount
of potential damages exceeds the indemnification available hereunder by an
amount that exceeds the amount that is available hereunder, after taking into
account all other claims made or reasonably anticipated or (D) the
Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the defense within
thirty (30) Business Days after receiving notice of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall be permitted to participate in
the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and it its own
expense.

 

(c) If an Indemnified Party reasonably expects to make a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim, it
shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the Indemnifying Party,
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder, a reasonable estimate of the amount of such claim
(to the extent known or reasonably determinable) and such other information
with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request;
_provided_ , that the failure to so notify an Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent that (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
by such failure.

(d) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this _Section
9.05_ and _Section 7.03_ with respect to Tax Claims, _Section 7.03_ shall
control.

 

SECTION 9.06. _Remedies_. Except in the case of fraud by the other party in
connection with entering into this Agreement or consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of
_Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Purchaser
and Seller and the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that this provision shall not
limit any remedies available to Seller in respect of a breach of  _Section
5.04_ or the right to specific performance or injunctive relief pursuant to
_Section 11.16_.

 

SECTION 9.07. _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payments made
by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article IX _ shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all income Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 



67 SECTION 9.08. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_.

 

(a) Any party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks indemnification
under this _Article IX_ shall be required to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate the Loss, including taking any actions reasonably
requested by an Indemnifying Party, and an Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for any Loss to the extent such Loss is attributable to the
Indemnified Partys failure to mitigate the Loss.

(b) In calculating the amount of any Loss for which indemnification is sought
hereunder, the proceeds actually received by any Indemnified Party under any
insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by
or against any other Person (including pursuant to any indemnity, contribution
or similar proceeds recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
facts giving rise to the right of indemnification), net of any deductible or
actual costs or expenses incurred in connection with securing or obtaining
such proceeds, shall be deducted from the amount of such Losses (it being
agreed that if any such amounts are recovered by the Indemnified Party
subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an indemnification payment,
such amount shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to
the extent of the indemnification payment made). Each Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under
such insurance coverage and from such other Person alleged to have any
responsibility for such Loss. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Article IX_, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified
Party may have against any Person with respect to the subject matter
underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign
any such rights to the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 11.03. _Public Announcements_. Neither party to this Agreement shall
make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise communicate with any news media without the prior written consent
of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
unless otherwise required by Law or applicable stock exchange regulation, and
the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of
any such press release, public announcement or communication.

SECTION 11.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is deemed by any court to be violative of Law or public policy and
therefore invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



70 SECTION 11.05. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the TBA and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between Seller,
Parent and Purchaser with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

SECTION 11.06. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party
hereto without the express written consent of the other parties (which
consent may be granted or withheld in such parties sole discretion);
_provided_ , _however_ , so long as Purchaser remains liable for the
performance of its obligations hereunder, Purchaser or Seller may assign its
rights under this Agreement (including the right to acquire the title to and
ownership of the Shares or to receive the Purchase Price, as applicable) to a
wholly owned subsidiary without the consent of the other party, provided that
such assignment would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 11.07. _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified
except (a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, each party
hereto, or (b) by a waiver in accordance with _Section 11.08_.

SECTION 11.08. _Waiver_. Either Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser or
Parent, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party pursuant
hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the other party
or conditions to such partys obligations contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or
a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other
term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of either party hereto to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of
such rights.

 

SECTION 11.09. _Audit Assistance_. Seller acknowledges that Parent is a
reporting company under the Exchange Act and that, in connection therewith,
Parent may be required to file with the SEC financial statements relating to
the Companies, the Business and the Stations prepared in accordance with

"). Accordingly, Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish promptly to Parent and Purchaser any additional information or
documents as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request which are necessary
for the completion of the S-X Financials that are within its possession or
control; _provided_ , that none of Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall be required to pay any fee or incur any cost or expense
that is not promptly reimbursed by Parent or Purchaser. None of the Seller
Indemnified Parties shall have any Liability in respect of such S-X Financials
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and Purchaser and Parent
shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for and against any and all
Losses arising out of or resulting from the S-X Financials or Sellers or its
Affiliates or Representatives cooperation pursuant to this _Section 11.09_.

 



71 SECTION 11.10. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (including the provisions of _Article IX_ relating to indemnified
parties), is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any
rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 11.11. _Neutral Construction_. Seller and Purchaser agree that this
Agreement was negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are
the product of the parties negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to
have been jointly and equally drafted by Seller and Purchaser, and the
provisions hereof should not be construed against a party on the grounds that
the party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provision.

SECTION 11.12. _Currency_. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in

or dispute hereunder) without regard to the Laws of any other jurisdiction

Delaware. Each party irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by the other party or
its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in any State or
Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (or, if such court lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate Delaware State or Federal
court), and each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each party agrees not to commence any action, suit or
proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware,
other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any
judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described
herein. Each party further agrees that notice as provided herein shall
constitute sufficient service of process and each party further waives any
argument that such service is insufficient. Each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,

proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the

ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 

SECTION 11.15. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by email or facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

SECTION 11.16. _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
to the parties would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that any party shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without bond
or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which such party is entitled at Law or in equity.

 

Section 11.17. _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates and Representatives, hereby does release and
forever discharge the Companies and the Transferred Employees and their
respective successors and assigns (the " _Company Releasees_ "), in their
capacities as such, from any and all Liabilities whatsoever, whether at Law
or in equity, and whether known or unknown, in respect of the Companies as a
result of any act or omission, prior to the TBA Effective Date, by such
Company Releasees, other than any action or omission involving fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence. From and after the Closing, the Seller shall
not initiate or maintain any Action against the Company Releasees in respect
of Liabilities released pursuant to this _Section 11.17_.

 

SECTION 11.18. _Effect of TBA; Denver TBA_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall have no liability
under, and shall not be deemed in breach of, this Agreement, the TBA or the
Denver TBA for the breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement herein or therein, nor shall
any condition precedent to Purchasers obligations hereunder be deemed to
have not been satisfied, to the extent such breach or failure, or the failure
of such condition precedent, arises out of or results from Purchasers or the
Denver Programmers, or their respective Affiliates or their respective
Representatives actions or omissions under the TBA or Denver TBA or during
the TBA Period (collectively, the " _Purchaser Actions_ ").

 

SECTION 11.19. _Conflicts and Privilege_. It is acknowledged by each of the
parties hereto that Seller and the Companies have retained Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen and Katz and Lerman Senter PLLC (together, the " _Existing Counsel_ ") to
act as counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
with respect to other matters occurring prior to or after the date hereof. To
the extent that any material subject to the attorney-client privilege or any
other applicable legal privilege, as regards the Companies, has been shared
between them, whether prior to or after the date hereof, it is the parties
desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material
is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way such

 



73  materials continued protection under attorney-client or any other
applicable legal privilege. Specifically, the parties agree that (a) Parent
and Purchaser shall not, and from and after the Closing shall cause the
Companies to not, seek to have any Existing Counsel disqualified from
representing Seller or (prior to the Closing only) the Companies in any
dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of
or related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder
in whole or in part, and (b) in connection with any dispute that may arise,
prior to the Closing, between Seller or any of the Companies, on the one hand,
and Parent or Purchaser, on the other hand, or, from and after the Closing,
Parent, Purchaser or the Companies, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, Seller (and not any of the Companies) will have the sole and exclusive
right to decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client or other
applicable privilege that may apply to any communications between Seller or
any of the Companies and any Existing Counsel that occurred on or prior to the
Closing. Except with respect to any existing or pending litigation or
administrative proceedings, or any internal investigations relating to
circumstances that could result in either of the foregoing, for which the
parties shall cooperate in good faith to share attorney-client privilege,
upon and after the Closing, (i) Seller and its Affiliates (and not the
Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client and any other
applicable legal privilege with respect to the engagement of Existing Counsel,
and none of the Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that
files of Existing Counsel constitute property of the client, only Seller and
its Affiliates (and not the Companies) shall hold such property rights, and
(iii) Existing Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose
any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Existing Counsel and any of
the Companies or otherwise.

[Signature Page to Stock Purchase Agreement] _GUARANTEE_

 

Entercom Communications Corp., a Pennsylvania corporation (" _Parent_ " or "
_Purchaser Guarantor_ "), hereby executes this Guarantee, which shall be
deemed a part of the preceding Stock Purchase Agreement among The Lincoln
National Life Insurance Company (" _Seller_ "), Parent and Entercom Radio, LLC
(" _Purchaser_ "), dated as of December 7, 2014 (the " _Agreement_ "),
attached hereto, for purposes of making the following guarantee in favor, and
for the benefit, of the Seller. Capitalized terms used herein without

Purchaser Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably, and unconditionally,
guarantees to Seller and the other Seller Indemnitees the prompt and complete
performance of each and all of (a) Purchasers obligations under the Agreement

Agreement, and (b) the Denver Programmers obligations under the Denver TBA,
including, without limitation, all of the Denver Programmers obligations to
pay amounts due to Seller under the TBA, in each case as and when the
performance of the same shall become due (collectively, the " _Guarantee
Obligations_ "). Upon failure by Purchaser to perform punctually any
Guarantee Obligation, Purchaser Guarantor shall forthwith without demand
perform such obligation in the manner specified herein. The obligations of
Purchaser Guarantor hereunder shall be an unconditional and absolute
guarantee of payment and performance and not of collectability only.

Purchaser Guarantor hereby agrees that the Guarantee Obligations set
forth herein shall not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced, or
affected by any renewal, extension, adjustment, or modification of the
Guarantee Obligations, including the time, place or manner of payment thereof,
and Purchaser Guarantor consents to any extensions of time of the Guarantee
Obligations, to any changes in the terms of the Guarantee Obligations as
agreed to by Seller and Purchaser, and to any settlement or adjustment with
respect to the Guarantee Obligations entered into between Seller and
Purchaser. Purchaser Guarantor hereby waives any and all rights or defenses
which would otherwise require an election of remedies by Seller, and further

dishonor and protest, notice of any Guarantee Obligations incurred and all
other notices of any kind (other than those expressly required by the
Agreement, the TBA or the Denver TBA), all defenses that may be available by
virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium, or similar law now or hereafter in
effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Purchaser or any
other Person, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than fraud and
defenses that are available to Parent or Purchaser under the Agreement, the
TBA or Denver TBA to performance of the Guarantee Obligations). Purchaser
Guarantor hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any rights that it may have
or acquire against Purchaser that arise from the existence,
payment, performance, or enforcement of the Guarantee Obligations (other than
any such rights that Parent or Purchaser has against Seller under the
Agreement, the TBA the Denver TBA), including, without limitation, any right
of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification
and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of Seller against
Purchaser, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or
under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the
right to take or receive from Purchaser, directly or indirectly, in cash or
other property or by set-off or in any  other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right,
unless and until the Guarantee Obligations shall have been performed in full
(including, with respect to any payment obligations, all such amounts due
having been paid to Seller in cash in full). If any amount shall be paid to
Purchaser Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any
time prior to the performance in full of the Guarantee Obligations (including
the payment to Seller in cash in full of all amounts due), such amount shall
be received and held in trust for the benefit of Seller, shall be segregated
from other property and funds of Purchaser Guarantor and shall forthwith be
paid or delivered to Seller in the same form as so received (with any
necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the
Guarantee Obligations. Purchaser Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive
substantial benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the
TBA and the Denver TBA, and this Guarantee, including the waivers set forth
herein, is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. The Guarantee
Obligations shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or
incurred in reliance on this Guarantee.

No delays on the part of Seller in the exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to any of the Guarantee Obligations shall operate as a waiver thereof,
and no single or partial exercise by Seller of any right or remedy with
respect to any of the Guarantee Obligations shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Seller
shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guarantee Obligations
in the event that Parent or Purchaser becomes subject to a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of Seller to so file
shall not affect the Guarantee Obligations hereunder. Purchaser Guarantors
obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until all
Guarantee Obligations shall have been performed in full. If at any time any
performance of any Guarantee Obligation is rescinded or must be otherwise
restored or returned upon Purchasers insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
or otherwise, Purchaser Guarantors obligations hereunder with respect to
such performance shall be reinstated as though such performance had been due
but not made at such time. If acceleration of the time for performance of any
Guarantee Obligation is stayed upon Purchasers insolvency, bankruptcy
or reorganization, all such Guarantee Obligations otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of the Agreement, the TBA or the Denver TBA shall
nonetheless by performed by Purchaser Guarantor hereunder forthwith. Purchaser
Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Guarantee Obligations set forth
herein shall not be released, discharged or affected by any change in
corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Purchaser or any
other Person, any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding involving Parent or Purchaser, the addition, substitution or
release of any Person now or hereafter liable with respect to the Guarantee
Obligations, any rescission, waver or amendment of the Agreement or the TBA,
the existence of any claim, set-off or other right that Purchaser Guarantor
may have against any Person, the adequacy of any other means of Seller
obtaining payment or performance related to any of the Guarantee Obligations,
the validity or enforceability of the Agreement or the TBA or any provision
of applicable Law purporting to prohibit the performance by Purchaser
Guarantor of any of the Guarantee Obligations, any release, impairment, non-
perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security or co-obligor for
any of Purchasers obligations under the Agreement, the TBA or the Denver TBA,
or any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by Seller, Purchaser
or any other Person or any other circumstance which might, but for the
provisions hereof, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defense to
Purchaser Guarantors obligations hereunder (other than to the extent such
act, omission, delay or circumstance gives rise to a defense available to
Parent or Purchaser under the Agreement, the TBA or the Denver TBA to
performance of the Guarantee Obligations). Purchaser Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this Guarantee is a primary
obligation of Purchaser Guarantor, and that Seller shall be entitled to make
a demand hereunder, and pursue all of its rights and remedies against it,
whether or not Seller has made any demand or pursued any remedies, or during
the pendency of any demand made hereunder or remedies pursued, against
Purchaser or any other Person. Purchaser Guarantor further agrees that this
Guarantee shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Purchaser
Guarantor and its successors and assigns. Purchaser Guarantor represents and
warrants to Seller that it has the financial capacity to pay and perform the
Guarantee Obligations and has all requisite power and authority to make,
execute and deliver this Guarantee and that this Guarantee constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser Guarantor, enforceable
against Purchaser Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

 

This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on
Purchaser Guarantor, its successors and assigns, until all the Guarantee
Obligations have been performed in full. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Purchaser Guarantor has caused this Guarantee to be
executed and delivered as of the date first written above by its officer
thereunto duly authorized.

of, its Common Stock or other Junior Securities or Qualifying Future Parity
Stock upon payment in cash in full (including all accumulated Dividends as of
the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date) of all such Dividends and
amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 4(a)_ and _Section 8_, if

Dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue upon any

the terms hereof.

(c) The Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any
cash dividends that may from time to time be paid on the Common Stock.

_Section 5\. Liquidation. _

 

(a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Companys affairs, Lincoln shall be entitled to receive liquidating
distributions, out of assets legally available for distribution to the
Companys shareholders, before any distribution of assets is made to the
holders of the Common Stock or any other Junior Securities, in the amount
per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) the
Liquidation Preference, plus all accrued but unpaid Dividends, whether or not
declared, that have not previously been added to the Liquidation Preference
and (ii) if such liquidation, dissolution or winding up occurs after the
three (3) year anniversary of the Date of First Issuance, the cash value (at
the Current Market Price) Lincoln would have received upon such event if
Lincoln had converted its shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of
Class A Common Stock pursuant to _Section 9_ immediately prior to such event.
After payment in full of such liquidating distributions, Lincoln shall not be
entitled to participate in any further distributions of the remaining assets
of the Company as a holder of Series A Preferred Stock.

(b) In the event that the assets of the Company available for distribution to
shareholders upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the affairs of the Company shall be insufficient to pay in full
the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock and Qualifying Future Parity Stock, Lincoln

 



7  and the holders of such shares of Qualifying Future Parity Stock shall share
ratably in any distribution of assets of the Company in proportion to the full
respective liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be
respectively entitled.

(c) For the purposes of this _Section 5_, a Fundamental Change (in and
of itself) shall be deemed not to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
of the Company subject to this _Section 5_ (it being understood that an
actual liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company in connection
with a Fundamental Change will be subject to this _Section 5_).

_Section 6\. Maturity_. The Series A Preferred Stock shall be perpetual
unless redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with these Terms of
Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

 _Section 7\. Redemption. _

 

(a) _Redemption at the Option of the Company_.

 

(i) On and after the Date of First Issuance and to but not including the three
(3) year anniversary of the Date of First Issuance, and on and after the six
(6) year anniversary of the Date of First Issuance, the Company, at its
option, may redeem (out of funds legally available therefor) all or any
portion of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in aggregate
increments of $2,500,000 at a purchase price per share in cash equal to the
sum, determined as of (but excluding) the Redemption Date, of the Liquidation
Preference, plus all accrued and unpaid Dividends, whether or not declared,
that have not previously been added to the Liquidation Preference, (the
"Redemption Price"); provided, that in the event the Redemption Price for all
of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is less than $2,500,000,
the Company may redeem such lesser aggregate amount. On and after the three
(3) year anniversary of the Date of First Issuance and to but not including
the six (6) year anniversary of the Date of First Issuance, the Company shall
not redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock.

(ii) If the Company elects to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding
shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section 7(a)(i)_, the
"Redemption Date" shall be the date on which the Company elects to consummate
such redemption. The Company shall deliver to Lincoln a written notice of
such redemption (a "Redemption Notice") not less than: (A) if the Redemption
Date occurs prior to but not including the three (3) year anniversary of the
Date of First Issuance, five (5) Business Days prior to the Redemption Date,
or (B) if the Redemption Date occurs on or after the three (3) year
anniversary of the Date of First Issuance, fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the Redemption Date. The Redemption Notice must state the following: the
aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the
Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and that Dividends, if any, on the
shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date,
provided that the Redemption Price shall have been paid in full on the
Redemption Date.

 



8 (b) _Mechanics of Redemption_.

 

(i) Upon the Redemption Date, the Company shall pay the Redemption Price to
Lincoln by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Company shall
remain liable for the payment of the Redemption Price to the extent such
amounts are not paid as provided herein.

 

(ii) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed on the Redemption Date
will, on and after such date, no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all
powers, designations, preferences and other rights of such shares (except the
right to receive from the Company the Redemption Price) shall cease and
terminate; provided that in the event that any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock are not redeemed due to a default in payment by the Company or because
the Company is otherwise unable to or fails to pay the Redemption Price in
cash in full on the Redemption Date, such shares will remain outstanding and
will be entitled to all of the powers, designations, preferences and other
rights (including but not limited to the accrual and payment of Dividends) as
provided herein.

 

(iii) Any redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section
7_ (any "Redemption") shall be payable out of cash legally available
therefor. The Company shall not be permitted to effect a Redemption if the
Company has insufficient funds to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock to be so redeemed upon the Redemption.

 

 _Section 8\. Fundamental Change. _

 

(a) _Repurchase at Lincoln s Option_.

 

(i) In connection with any Fundamental Change, Lincoln shall have the right,
at its option, to require the Company to, or to cause the Survivor of a
Fundamental Change (such Survivor of a Fundamental Change, the "Acquirer") to,
purchase each and every share of Series A Preferred Stock held by Lincoln, but
not less than each and every share (the "Fundamental Change Offer"), at a
purchase price per share in cash, determined as of (but excluding) the
Fundamental Change Effective Date, equal to: (A) if the Fundamental Change
occurs prior to but not including the three (3) year anniversary of the Date
of First Issuance, the sum of the Liquidation Preference, plus all accrued and
unpaid Dividends, whether or not declared, that have not previously been added
to the Liquidation Preference; or (B) if the Fundamental Change occurs on or
after the three (3) year anniversary of the Date of First Issuance, the
greater of (x) the Liquidation Preference, plus all accrued and unpaid
Dividends, whether or not declared, that have not previously been added to
the Liquidation Preference and (y) the Current Market Price of the Class A
Common Stock that Lincoln would have received if it had converted each and
every share of its Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Class A Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 9_ immediately prior to the Fundamental Change
Effective Date (as applicable, the "Fundamental Change Price").

 



9 (ii) On or before 30 days prior to any Fundamental Change Effective Date, or
in the event the Company is not aware of such Fundamental Change at least 30
days prior to the Fundamental Change Effective Date, as soon as otherwise
practicable, the Company shall deliver to Lincoln a written notice of such
Fundamental Change (the "Fundamental Change Notice"). Such Fundamental Change
Notice must state: (A) the Fundamental Change Purchase Date (which shall be no
earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date notice is mailed);
(B) that the Fundamental Change Offer may be accepted by delivery, no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, of
a written revocable notice specifying that the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock are to be repurchased; (C) the Fundamental Change Price, specifying the
individual components thereof; (D) that any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
not tendered for payment shall continue to be outstanding and Lincoln shall
remain entitled to, among other things, the payment of Dividends thereon and
the ability to exercise their conversion rights thereto and the Conversion
Price following such Fundamental Change; and (E) the circumstances and
material facts regarding such Fundamental Change.

(b) _Mechanics of Repurchase_.

 

(i) On the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, the Company shall pay to Lincoln
the Fundamental Change Price in respect of each share of Series A Preferred
Stock to be repurchased as specified in Lincolns notice delivered pursuant to
_Section 8(a)(ii)_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The
Company shall remain liable for the payment of the Fundamental Change Price
to the extent such amounts are not paid as provided herein.

(ii) On and after the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock to be repurchased on such Fundamental Change Purchase Date
shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all powers, designations,
preferences and other rights of Lincoln as a holder of such shares (except
the right to receive from the Company the Fundamental Change Price) shall
cease and terminate with respect to such shares; provided, that in the event
that any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not repurchased due to
a default in payment by the Company or because the Company is otherwise
unable to or fails to pay the Fundamental Change Price in full on the
Fundamental Change Purchase Date, such shares will remain outstanding and will
be entitled to all of the powers, designations, preferences and other rights
(including but not limited to the payment of Dividends and the conversion
rights) as provided herein.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8_ to the contrary, Lincoln
shall retain the right, through to the Close of Business three (3) days prior
to the Fundamental Change Purchase Date, to withdraw an election to have its
shares of Series A Preferred Stock repurchased or any tender of such shares in
the Fundamental Change Offer; provided, however, that where it exercises such
right, the shares pertaining thereto shall not be repurchased pursuant to this
_Section 8_.

 

(iv) The Company shall not be required to make a Fundamental Change Offer if
an Affiliate in control of the Company makes a Fundamental Change Offer in
the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in this _Section 8_ and purchases all shares of Series A Preferred
Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Fundamental Change Offer.

 



10 (v) The Company will not enter into any agreement providing for or
otherwise authorize, and the Company shall not have the corporate power to
effect, a Fundamental Change unless the Acquirer agrees in writing to cause
the Company to make the repurchases contemplated in and to otherwise comply in
all respects with this  _Section 8_ and agrees, for the benefit of Lincoln
(including making it an express beneficiary of such agreement), that to the
extent the Company is not legally able to repurchase the Series A Preferred
Stock, the Acquirer or an Affiliate of the Acquirer will purchase the Series
A Preferred Stock on the terms set forth in this _Section 8_.

(vi) Any repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section
8_ shall be payable out of any cash legally available therefor, and if there
is not a sufficient amount of cash available, then the Company shall or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, to the extent necessary, sell remaining assets of
the Company or of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, legally available therefor
for cash and shall use the proceeds therefrom to fund the repurchase of Series
A Preferred Stock pursuant to this _Section 8_. To the extent that the
Company has insufficient funds, after the sale of assets contemplated by the
preceding sentence, to repurchase all of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock pursuant to this  _Section 8_, the Company shall repurchase as many of
such shares as it has cash legally available therefor and shall thereafter
from time to time, as soon as it shall have cash (including upon the future
sale of assets by the Company or by its Subsidiaries as contemplated by the
preceding sentence) legally available therefor, make payment of as much of the
remaining amount as it legally may until it has made such payment in its
entirety. For the avoidance of doubt, such partial payments shall not reduce
or waive the rights of Lincoln hereunder.

_Section 9\. Optional Conversion. _

 

(a) _Conversion at the Option of Lincoln_.

 

(i) At any time on or after the three (3) year anniversary of the Date of
First Issuance, Lincoln shall have the right, at its option, to convert each
and every share of its Series A Preferred Stock, but not less than each and
every share, as set forth in this _Section 9_. Upon such an election, on the
Conversion Date, Lincolns shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall convert
into, at the option of the Company, either (A) a number of shares of Class A
Common Stock equal to the Liquidation Preference plus all accrued and unpaid
Dividends, whether or not declared, that have not previously been added to
the Liquidation Preference divided by the then applicable Conversion Price,
plus cash in lieu of any fractional share as determined in accordance with
_Section 12_ hereof, or (B) the cash value of such shares of Class A Common
Stock at the Current Market Price as of the Conversion Date.

(ii) Prior to the delivery of any shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to
this _Section 9_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (A) comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder
requiring the registration of 

 



11  such shares with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by,
any governmental authority and (B) to the extent that the Class A Common Stock
is traded on a United States national or regional securities exchange, list
such shares on such exchange.

(b) _Mechanics of Optional Conversion_.

 

(i) For Lincoln to convert its Series A Preferred Stock into Class A Common
Stock pursuant to this _Section 9_, it must deliver written notice (the
"Conversion Notice") to the Company that it elects to do so. The date of
actual receipt of the Conversion Notice by the Company shall be the
"Conversion Date."

 

(ii) Within three (3) Trading Days of receiving a Conversion Notice, the
Company shall send a confirmation of receipt of such notice to Lincoln. On or
before the fifth (5th) Trading Day following the date of receipt by the
Company of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall issue and deliver to
Lincoln, at the option of the Company, either: (A) a certificate, registered
in the name of Lincoln or its designee, for the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock to which Lincoln shall be entitled, as well as any cash owed in
lieu of fractional shares to Lincoln as determined in accordance with
_Section 12_ hereof, or (B) the cash value of such Class A Common Stock at
the Current Market Price as of the Conversion Date.

 

(iii) Effective immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Conversion
Date, Dividends shall no longer be declared or accrued on the converted
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such converted shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding, subject to the right of Lincoln
to receive any payments to which it is otherwise entitled pursuant to 
_Section 9_ or _Section 12_ hereof, as applicable.

(iv) Prior to the Conversion Date, shares of Class A Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be deemed
outstanding for any purpose, and Lincoln shall have no rights with respect to
the Class A Common Stock (including voting rights, rights to respond to
tender offers for the Class A Common Stock or other securities issuable upon
conversion and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on the
Class A Common Stock or other securities issuable upon conversion) by virtue
of holding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

(v) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock duly converted in accordance with this
_Section 9_, or otherwise reacquired by the Company, will resume the status
of authorized and unissued preferred stock, undesignated as to series and,
subject to any consent or vote required pursuant to  _Section 11_ hereof,
available for future issuance. The Company may from time to time take such
appropriate action as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Company shall
not take any such action if it would reduce the authorized number of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock below the number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock then outstanding.

 



12 _Section 10\. Anti-Dilution Adjustments. _

 

(a) The Conversion Price shall be subject to the following adjustments:

 

(i) _Stock Dividends and Distributions_. If the Company pays dividends or
other distributions on the Class A Common Stock in shares of Class A Common
Stock (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, directly or indirectly, Class A Common
Stock, which are otherwise provided for in  _Section 10(a)(iv)_), then the
Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in
effect at the Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately prior to the
Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution by the following fraction:



      
--- 
     _ OS0 _ 
   OS1 
 

Where,

 

OS0 = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.

OS1 = the sum of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution plus the
total number of shares of Class A Common Stock constituting such dividend or
distribution.

 

The adjustment pursuant to this clause (i) shall become effective at 9:00
a.m., New York City time on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.
For the purposes of this clause (i), the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in treasury by the
Company.

 

(ii) _Subdivisions, Splits and Combination of the Class A Common Stock_. If
the Company subdivides, splits or combines the shares of Class A Common
Stock, then the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the
Conversion Price in effect at the Close of Business on the Trading Day
immediately prior to the effective date of such share subdivision, split or
combination by the following fraction:



      
--- 
     _ OS0 _ 
   OS1 
 

Where,

 

OS0 = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the effective date of such share subdivision, split or combination.

OS1 = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately
after the opening of business on the effective date of such share subdivision,
split or combination.

 



13 The adjustment pursuant to this clause (ii) shall become effective at 9:00
a.m., New York City time on the effective date of such subdivision, split or
combination. For the purposes of this clause (ii), the number of shares of
Class A Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in
treasury by the Company.

 

(iii) _Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights_. If the Company issues to all or
substantially all holders of the shares of Class A Common Stock rights or
warrants (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend
reinvestment plan, shareholder rights plan, share purchase plan or other
similar plans) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, directly or indirectly, Class A Common
Stock, which are otherwise provided for in _Section 10(a)(iv)_) at less than
the Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of
shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, then the Conversion
Price will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect at the
Close of Business on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Ex-Date for
such issuance by the following fraction:



      
--- 
     _ OS0 \+ Y _ 
   OS0 \+ X 
 

Where,

 

OS0 = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution.

X = the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to
such rights or warrants.

Y = the number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the aggregate price
payable to exercise such rights or warrants divided by the Current Market
Price on such date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to
receive such rights or warrants.

 

Any adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) shall become effective
immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Ex-Date for such
issuance. For the purposes of this clause (iii), the number of shares of Class
A Common Stock at the time outstanding shall not include shares held in
treasury by the Company. The Company shall not issue any such rights or
warrants in respect of shares of the Class A Common Stock held in treasury by
the Company. To the extent that such rights or warrants are not exercised
prior to their expiration or shares of Class A Common Stock are otherwise not
delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the exercise of such
rights or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such
Conversion Price that

 



14  would then be in effect had the adjustment made upon the issuance of such
rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number
of shares of Class A Common Stock actually delivered. In determining the
aggregate offering price payable for such shares of Class A Common Stock,
there shall be taken into account any consideration received for such rights
or warrants and the value of such consideration (if other than cash, to be
reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors).

(iv) _Debt or Asset Distributions_. If the Company distributes to all or
substantially all holders of shares of Class A Common Stock evidences of
indebtedness, shares of Capital Stock, securities (including securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, directly or indirectly, Class A Common
Stock), cash or other assets, including any dividend or distribution in excess
of $1 million in the aggregate for all shares of Common Stock (on a per annum
basis) (excluding (A) any dividend or distribution referred to in clause (i)
above, (B) any rights or warrants referred to in clause (iii) above, (C) any
dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash for an amount that is not in
excess of $1 million in the aggregate for all shares of Common Stock (on a
per annum basis), (D) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or
exchange offer made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries referred to in
clause (v) below, and (E) any dividend of shares of Capital Stock of any
class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary
or other business unit in the case of certain spin-off transactions as
described below in this clause (iv)), then the Conversion Price will be
adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect at the Close of
Business on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such
distribution by the following fraction:

 



      
--- 
     _ SP0 \- FMV _ 
  SP0 
 

Where,

 

SP0 = the Current Market Price per share of Class A Common Stock on such
date. 

FMV = the cash (in the case of cash dividends or distributions giving rise to
an adjustment, the amount of such cash dividends or distributions in excess
of $1 million, in the aggregate) or fair market value of the portion of the
distribution applicable to one share of Class A Common Stock on such date as
reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" as set forth above is
equal to or greater than "SP0" as set forth above, as reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors, the Company shall be prohibited from
making such dividend or distribution.

In a "spin-off, where the Company makes a distribution to all or
substantially all holders of shares of Class A Common Stock consisting of
capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity

 



15  interests of, or relating to, a Subsidiary or other business unit, the
Conversion Price will be adjusted on the 15th Trading Day after the effective
date of the distribution by multiplying such Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such 15th Trading Day by the following fraction:



      
--- 
     _ MP0 _ 
   MP0 \+ MPs 
 

Where,

 

MP0 = the volume-weighted average of the Closing Prices of the Class A
Common Stock over the first 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the
fifth Trading Day following the effective date of such distribution.

 

MPS = the volume-weighted average of the Closing Prices of the Capital Stock
or equity interests representing the portion of the distribution applicable
to one share of Class A Common Stock over the first 10 Trading Days commencing
on and including the fifth Trading Day following the effective date of such
distribution, or, if not traded on a national or regional securities exchange
or over-the-counter market, the fair market value of the capital stock or
equity interests representing the portion of the distribution applicable to
one share of Class A Common Stock on such date as reasonably determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors.

Any adjustment pursuant to this clause (iv) (other than with respect to spin-
off transactions as described above, which shall become effective as described
therein) shall become effective immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the Ex-Date for such distribution.

 

(v) _Self-Tender Offers and Exchange Offers_. If the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries successfully completes a tender or exchange offer for the Class
A Common Stock where the cash and the value of any other consideration
included in the payment per share of the Class A Common Stock exceeds the
Closing Price of the Class A Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately
succeeding the expiration of the tender or exchange offer, then the Conversion
Price will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect at the
Close of Business on the expiration date of the offer by the following
fraction: 



      
--- 
     _ OS0 x SP0 _ 
   AC + (SP0 x OS1) 
  



16 Where,

 

SP0 = the Closing Price per share of Class A Common Stock on the Trading
Day immediately succeeding the expiration of the tender or exchange offer.

OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the expiration of the tender or exchange offer, including any shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn.

 

OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the
expiration of the tender or exchange offer.

AC = the aggregate cash and fair market value of the other consideration
payable in the tender or exchange offer, as reasonably determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors with respect to such other consideration.

Any adjustment made pursuant to this clause (v) shall become effective
immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Trading Day
immediately following the Trading Day immediately succeeding the expiration of
the tender or exchange offer. In the event that the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries is obligated to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant
to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary
is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases,
or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Price shall be
readjusted to be such Conversion Price that would then be in effect if such
tender offer or exchange offer had not been made.

 

(vi) _Rights Plans_. To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in
effect with respect to the Class A Common Stock on the Conversion Date, upon
conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, Lincoln will
receive, in addition to the shares of Class A Common Stock, the rights under
the rights plan, unless, prior to the Conversion Date, the rights have
separated from the shares of Class A Common Stock, in which case the
Conversion Price will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company
had made a distribution to all holders of the Class A Common Stock as
described in clause (iv) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the
expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.

 

(vii) _Issuances Below the Current Market Price_. If, prior to the three (3)
year anniversary of the Date of First Issuance the Company issues or sells,
or agrees to issue or sell, to any of its Affiliates, excluding equity
compensation, any Class A Common Stock (or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, directly or indirectly, Class A Common Stock) for
consideration per share (in the case of convertible or exchangeable
securities, on an as-converted basis) less than the Current Market Price,
then, unless the Company shall offer Lincoln the right to participate in such
sale or issuance at the same price and otherwise on the same terms as such
Affiliate

 



17  on a pro rata basis (measured assuming the conversion by Lincoln of each
share of Series A Preferred Stock at the Conversion Price then in effect,
whether or not the Series A Preferred Stock is then convertible), the
Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance will be
reduced, effective immediately after such issuance, to the price determined by
multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance
by the following fraction:



      
--- 
     _ OS0 \+ (AC/SP) _ 
   OS1 
 

Where,

 

OS0 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
such issuance.

AC = the aggregate consideration paid or payable for such shares of Class A
Common Stock or convertible securities.

 

SP = the Current Market Price.

 

OS1 = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
issuance (including, in the case of convertible or exchangeable securities,
on an as-converted basis

(b) The Company may make such decreases in the Conversion Price, in addition
to any other decreases required by this _Section 10_, as the Board of
Directors deems advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of
the Class A Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of
shares of Class A Common Stock (or issuance of rights or warrants to acquire
shares of Class A Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income
tax purposes or for any other reason.

 

(c) All adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be calculated to the nearest
1/10th of a cent. No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required if
such adjustment would be less than $0.01; provided that any adjustments which
by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried
forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; provided
further that effective on the Conversion Date in the case of conversion
pursuant to _Section 9_ hereof, adjustments to the Conversion Price will be
made with respect to any such adjustment carried forward and which has not
been taken into account before such date. If one or more events occurs
requiring an adjustment to be made to the Conversion Price during the same
time period, adjustments to the Conversion Price shall be made to reflect the
combined impact of all Conversion Price adjustment events during such period.

(d) Whenever the Conversion Price is to be adjusted in accordance with
_Section 10(a)_ or  _Section 10(b)_, the Company shall: (i) compute the
Conversion Price in accordance with _Section 10(a)_ or _Section 10(b)_,
taking into account the $0.01 threshold set forth in _Section 10(c)_
hereof; (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that
requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to _Section 10(a)_ or
_Section 10(b)_, taking into 

 



18  account the $0.01 threshold set forth in _Section 10(c)_ hereof, provide,
or cause to be provided, a written notice to Lincoln of the occurrence of such
event; and (iii) as soon as practicable following the determination of the
revised Conversion Price in accordance with _Section 10(a)_ or _Section
10(b)_ hereof, provide, or cause to be provided, a written notice to Lincoln
setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the
Conversion Price was determined and setting forth the revised Conversion Price
and the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
each and every share of Series A Preferred Stock at such revised Conversion
Price.

(e) The Company will not take any action of the type described in  _Section
10(a)_ with respect to any other class of Capital Stock of the Company,
including Class B Common Stock, unless such action is taken on a pro rata
basis with respect to each share of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing prohibition, if any such action is taken with respect to shares of
any class of Common Stock, including Class B Common Stock, but is not taken on
a pro rata basis with respect to each share of Class A Common Stock, such
adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price as may be necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the intent of this _Section 10_ and to avoid unjust
or inequitable results to Lincoln.

 

 _Section 11\. Voting Rights_. Lincoln shall not have any voting rights,
including the right to elect any directors, except for voting rights, if any,
required by law and as set forth in this _Section 11_. If at any time
following the Date of First Issuance any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
remain outstanding, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Lincoln:

(a) Amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision of its Charter, bylaws or the
terms of any series of preferred stock, including these Terms of Series A
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, in any manner that adversely affects
the rights, powers, privileges or preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock,
or increase the authorized number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
or issue any additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including debt or
other securities that are convertible into Series A Preferred Stock by their
terms;

 

(b) Amend, alter, waive or repeal any provision of its Charter, bylaws or the
terms of any preferred stock, including these Terms of Series A Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, to authorize or create, or increase the
authorized amount of, any shares of Capital Stock of the Company ranking
senior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to either or both the
payment of dividends or the distribution of assets on any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company ("Senior Stock"), or issue, or
reclassify into, any Senior Stock, including debt or other securities that are
convertible into Senior Stock by their terms;

(c) Consummate a Reorganization Event, unless such Reorganization Event
complies with _Section 15_ hereof; or 

(d) Authorize, commit or agree to take any of the actions set forth in
_Sections 11(a)_ , _11(b)_ or _11(c)_.

 



19 _Section 12\. Fractional Shares. _

 

(a) No fractional shares of Class A Common Stock will be issued as a result of
the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional share of Class A Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of a
conversion pursuant to _Section 9_ hereof, the Company shall pay an amount in
cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of the
Conversion Price.

(b) If more than one share of the Series A Preferred Stock is surrendered for
conversion at one time, the number of full shares of Class A Common Stock
issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock so surrendered.

 

 _Section 13\. Reservation of Common Stock_. The Company shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Class A Common
Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock as provided in _Section 9_ hereof, free from any preemptive or other
similar rights, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from
time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock then outstanding.

 

 _Section 14\. Certificates and Book-Entry_. No certificates representing the
Series A Preferred Stock shall be issued. Instead, Lincoln and the Company
shall maintain records showing (i) the number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock held by Lincoln, (ii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
that have been redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with these
Terms of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and (iii) the date(s)
of such redemption(s), repurchase(s) and/or conversion(s).

 

 _Section 15\. Reorganization Events_. The Company shall not effect any
Reorganization Event unless (i) the surviving Person in such Reorganization
Event, if other than the Company, is an entity organized and existing under
the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia, and following such Reorganization Event the Series A
Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the event such surviving Person is
not the Company, the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving Person,
in each case having such rights, powers, privileges, and preferences that are
not less favorable to Lincoln than the rights, powers, privileges, and
preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such
Reorganization Event (and that otherwise comply with these Terms of Series A
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock) and (ii) the Company gives Lincoln at
least 30 days written notice prior to consummating such Reorganization Event,
including the terms of such Reorganization Event, and the surviving Person in
such Reorganization Event (if other than the Company) expressly assumes by
written instrument delivered to Lincoln the obligations of the Company set
forth herein.

 

 _Section 16\. Miscellaneous. _

or certificates representing such shares. The Company shall not, however, be
required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer

Preferred Stock with respect to which such shares are issued or delivered

(i) If at any time when Holders own Registrable Securities, the Company
determines to file with the Commission a registration statement (whether or
not for its own account and including, for this purpose, a registration
effected by the Company for shareholders of the Company other than the
Holders) covering any securities that may be used to register Registrable
Securities held by the Investor (other than pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-4 or S-8), or the Company proposes to effect a Shelf
Takedown pursuant to an already effective registration statement, the Company
shall promptly give each Holder of Registrable Securities written notice of
such registration (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Upon the written request
of each Holder given within twenty (20) days following the date of such
notice, the Company shall cause to be included in such registration statement
and use its reasonable best efforts to be registered under the Securities Act
all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder shall have requested
to be registered. The Company shall have the right to withdraw or cease to
prepare or file any registration statement for any offering referred to in
this _Section 2.1_ prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement
or the completion of such a Shelf Takedown.

 

(ii) If the Underwriters Representative or Agent shall advise the Company in
writing that, in its opinion, the amount of Registrable Securities requested
to be included in such registration would materially adversely affect such
offering, or the timing thereof, then the Company will include in such
registration, to the extent of the amount and class which the Company is
so advised can be sold without such material adverse effect on such offering:
(A) first, all securities proposed to be sold by the Company for its own
account; or, if such registration is being effected for the account of any
securityholder of the Company pursuant to demand registration rights
comparable to the rights granted in _Section 2.2 below,_ all securities
proposed to be sold by such securityholder, (B) second, if such registration
is being effected for the account of any securityholder of the Company
pursuant to demand registration rights comparable to the rights granted in
_Section 2.2 below, _all securities proposed to be sold by the Company for
its own account (C) third, the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such registration pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ and all other
securities being registered pursuant to the exercise of contractual rights
comparable to the rights granted in this  _Section 2.1_; pro rata based on
the amount of such securities then proposed to be sold by such Persons, and
(D) fourth, all other securities requested to be included in such registration
allocated in accordance with the priorities then existing among such Persons.

(iii) Each Holder shall be entitled to have Registrable Securities included in
an unlimited number of Piggyback Registrations pursuant to this _Section
2.1_.

 



-4- 2.2. _Shelf Registration and Takedowns_.

 

(i) A Holder may request that the Company prepare and file with the
Commission, and the Company shall, within thirty (30) days following such
request, prepare and file with the Commission, a shelf registration statement
on Form S-3 or any similar short-form or other appropriate registration
statement that may be available at such time, which, if the Company is a
"well-known seasoned issuer" (as such term is defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act), shall be an "Automatic Shelf Registration Statement," (as
such term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) for the purpose of
registering under the Securities Act (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ")
the offer and sale of all or a portion of the Registrable Securities by the
Holders from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution
elected by such Holders and set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement
(the " _Shelf Registration_ "). The Shelf Registration Statement shall
indicate that the Registrable Securities are to be offered and sold on a
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.

(ii) If the Shelf Registration Statement is not automatically effective upon
filing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after the filing thereof, but in any event not later
than ninety (90) days following the date of the Holders request.

(iii) If prior to the Shelf Registration Termination Date, the number of
Registrable Securities at any time exceeds the number of securities then
registered for sale in the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall
file as soon as practicable an additional Shelf Registration Statement
covering the offer and sale by the Holders of not less than the number of
such Registrable Securities.

(iv) The Holders shall be entitled, at any time and from time to time when
there is an effective Shelf Registration Statement, to sell such Registrable
Securities as are then registered pursuant to such Shelf Registration
Statement in an underwritten offering if, based on the then-current market
prices, the number of Registrable Securities included in such underwritten
offering would yield gross proceeds of at least $10 million (each, a " _Shelf
Takedown_ "), but only upon not less than twenty (20) days prior written
notice (which shall include the number of Registrable Securities proposed to
be sold by the Holders) to the Company; _provided_ , that the Holders shall
only be entitled to a maximum of two (2) Shelf Takedowns under this Agreement
and one (1) Shelf Takedown in any twelve (12)-month period. The Selling
Holders shall give the Company prompt written notice of the consummation of a
Shelf Takedown.

(v) If the Underwriters Representative or Agent shall advise the Company in
writing (with a copy to each Selling Holder) that, in its opinion, the amount
of

 



-5-  Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Shelf Takedown would
materially adversely affect such offering, then the Company will include in
such Shelf Registration, to the extent of the amount and class which the
Company is so advised can be sold without such material adverse effect on such
offering, (A) first, all of the Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by
such Holder; (B) second, all securities proposed to be sold by the Company
for its own account; (C) third, all securities required to be registered
pursuant to the exercise of registration rights held by other Persons, pro
rata based on the amount of such securities then proposed to be sold by such
Persons and allocated in accordance with the priorities then existing among
such Persons.

(vi) If any of the Registrable Securities are to be sold in a Shelf Takedown,
the Company shall have the right to select the underwriters or Agent for each
Shelf Takedown, subject to the reasonable approval of the Holders.

 

Section 3\. _Registration Procedures_. Whenever required under _Section 2_ to
effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall take
each of the actions set forth in this _Section 3_, as expeditiously as
reasonably practicable.

 

3.1. In the case of any Piggyback Registration, the Company shall prepare and
file with the Commission a registration statement with respect to such
Registrable Securities and use the Companys reasonable best efforts to cause
such registration statement to become effective. With respect to either a
Piggyback Registration or Shelf Registration, before filing a registration
statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, including
documents incorporated by reference after the initial filing of the
registration statement and prior to effectiveness thereof, the Company shall
furnish to one (1) firm of counsel for the Selling Holders and, in the case
of an underwritten or agented offering, one (1) firm of counsel for the
underwriters or Agent, copies of all such documents in the form substantially
as proposed to be filed with the Commission at least four (4) business days
prior to filing for review and comment by such counsel.

3.2. With respect to either a Piggyback Registration or Shelf Registration,
the Company shall prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply
with the provisions of the Securities Act and rules thereunder with respect to
the disposition of all of the securities covered by such registration
statement. If the registration is for an underwritten offering, the Company
shall amend the applicable registration statement or supplement the
prospectus whenever required by the terms of the applicable underwriting
agreement. Subject to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, if the registration
statement is a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company shall amend the
registration statement or supplement the prospectus so that it will remain
current and in compliance with the requirements of the Securities Act for
three (3) years after its effective date, _provided_ , that in the case of
the Shelf Registration, the Company shall be required to use its reasonable
best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective
under the Securities Act until such time as there are no Registrable
Securities remaining (the " _Shelf Registration Termination Date_ "), and if
during such period any event or development occurs as a result of which the
registration statement or prospectus contains a misstatement of a material
fact 

 



-6-  or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, the Company shall promptly
notify each Selling Holder, amend the registration statement or supplement
the prospectus so that each will thereafter comply with the Securities Act and
furnish to each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities such amended or
supplemented prospectus, which each such Holder shall thereafter use in the
Transfer of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement.
Pending such amendment or supplement (and following written notice of the need
therefor) each such Holder shall cease making offers or Transfers
of Registrable Securities pursuant to the prior prospectus. In the event that
any Registrable Securities included in a registration statement subject to, or
required by, this Agreement remain unsold at the end of the period during
which the Company is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement, the Company may file a post-
effective amendment to the registration statement for the purpose of removing
such Registrable Securities from registered status.

3.3. The Company shall furnish to each Selling Holder of Registrable
Securities, without charge, such numbers of copies of the registration
statement, any pre-effective or post-effective amendment thereto, the
prospectus, including each preliminary prospectus and any amendments or
supplements thereto, in each case in conformity with the requirements of
the Securities Act and the rules thereunder, and such other related documents
as any such Selling Holder may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of Registrable Securities owned by such Selling Holder.

 

3.4. The Company shall use the Companys reasonable best efforts (i) to
register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement
under all applicable securities or blue sky laws of such states or
jurisdictions as may be necessary to enable the Holders to offer and sell the
Registrable Securities or as shall be reasonably requested by
the Underwriters Representative or Agent, and (ii) to obtain the withdrawal
of any order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement, or the
lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from
qualification) of the offer and transfer of any of the Registrable Securities
in any jurisdiction, as soon as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition
thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of
process in any such states or jurisdictions in which it is not already so
qualified or subject to service.

 

3.5. In the event of any underwritten or agented offering, the Company (and
any other Person who wishes to include securities in such registration
statement) shall enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting
or agency agreement (including indemnification and contribution obligations of
underwriters or agents), in usual and customary form (including
containing customary covenants, representations and warranties, including
provision for delivery of customary legal and disclosure opinions, auditors
comfort letters and closing documents), with the managing underwriter or
underwriters of or agents for such offering along with such other customary
documents and agreements as such underwriters or agents may request. Whether
or not an underwriting agreement is entered into, the Company shall make such
representations and warranties to the Selling Holders in form, substance and
scope as are customarily made in connection with an offering of common stock
or other equity securities pursuant to any appropriate agreement. The Company
and any other Person who wishes to include securities in any Shelf
Registration shall agree to sell its securities at the same price and on the
same terms and conditions as the Selling Holders.

 



-7- 3.6. The Company shall promptly notify each Selling Holder of any comments by
the Commission or any other governmental authority with respect to the
registration statement or any requests for supplements or amendments thereto,
or any stop order issued or threatened to be issued by the Commission in
connection therewith, and shall take all reasonable actions required to
respond as promptly as practicable to any such comment or request and to
prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered, and shall
promptly notify the Selling Holders when such action has been taken and such
order has been removed.

3.7. The Company shall make generally available to the Holders, the
underwriters or agents (if applicable) and their respective counsel copies of
all of the periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information filed
with the Commission or referred to in _Section 9.1_.

 

3.8. The Company shall make available for inspection by any Selling Holder,
any underwriter or agent participating in such offering and
the representatives of such Selling Holder and underwriters or agents (but
not more than one firm of counsel to such Selling Holder), all financial and
other information as shall be reasonably requested by them, and provide such
Selling Holder, any underwriter or agent participating in such offering and
the representatives of such Selling Holder and underwriters or agents the
opportunity to discuss the business affairs of the Company with its principal
executives and independent public accountants who have certified the audited
financial statements included in such registration statement, in each case as
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility under the Securities Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
information that the Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and
which the Company advises such Person in writing is confidential shall not be
disclosed unless such Person signs a customary confidentiality agreement. If
requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters or agents in any
underwritten or agented offering, the Company shall cause management to
participate in a reasonable number of presentations of management and road
shows.

 

3.9. The Company shall provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such
registration statement.

3.10. The Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement (i) if the
Common Stock is then listed on a securities exchange or included for quotation
in a recognized trading market, to continue to be so listed or included for a
reasonable period of time after the offering, and (ii) to be registered with
or approved by such other United States or state governmental agencies or
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
the Company to enable the Selling Holders of Registrable Securities to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.

 



-8- 3.11. The Company shall use the Companys reasonable best efforts to provide a
CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities prior to the effective date of
the first registration statement including Registrable Securities.

3.12. The Company shall take such other actions as are reasonably requested
in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities
included in each such registration.

 

Section 4\. _Holders  Obligations_. In connection with the registration of
Registrable Securities, each Selling Holder shall: 

4.1. furnish to the Company such information regarding such Selling Holder,
the number of the Registrable Securities owned by it and the intended method
of disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the
registration of such Selling Holders Registrable Securities, and to cooperate
with the Company in preparing such registration; and

 

4.2. in the case of a Piggyback Registration, agree to sell its Registrable
Securities to the underwriters at the same price and on the same terms and
conditions as the Company or the other Persons on whose behalf the
registration statement was being filed have agreed to sell their securities,
and to enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting or agency
agreement, in usual and customary form with the managing underwriter or
underwriters of or agents for such offering, _provided_ , that the Selling
Holders shall not be required to make any representation or warranty or agree
to any covenant that is more extensive or burdensome than those made by any
other Person that is registering securities.

Section 5\. _Expenses of Registration_. Expenses in connection with
registrations pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocated and paid as
follows:

5.1. The Company shall bear and pay all expenses incurred in connection with

including all registration, filing and Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc. fees, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or
blue sky laws, all word processing, duplicating and printing expenses,

and commissions relating to Registrable Securities (which shall be paid on a
_pro_ _rata_ basis by the Selling Holders).

5.2. Any failure of the Company to pay any Registration Expenses as required
by this _Section 5_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations under
this Agreement.

 



-9- Section 6\. _Indemnification; Contribution_. If any Registrable Securities are
included in a registration statement under this Agreement:

6.1. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless each Selling Holder, each underwriter or Agent in any
underwritten or agented offering, each Person, if any, who controls such
Selling Holder, underwriter or Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act,
and each officer, director, partner and employee, of such Selling Holder,
underwriter, Agent and such controlling Persons, against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (joint or several), including
attorneys fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by
such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, or to which any of the foregoing Persons may become subject
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state laws,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of
or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations
(collectively, a " _Violation_ "):

 

(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in such registration statement or prospectus, including
any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus or any "issuer free writing
prospectus" as such term is defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act, or
any amendments or supplements thereto; or

 

(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any such registration
statement or prospectus, including any preliminary prospectus or
final prospectus or "issuer free writing prospectus", or any amendments or
supplements thereto, a material fact required or allegedly required to be
stated therein, or necessary or allegedly necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading;

_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnification required by this  _Section
6.1_ shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without the
consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), nor shall the Company be liable in any
such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense solely to
the extent that it arises out of or is based upon (x) a Violation which occurs
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by the indemnified party for use in connection with such registration,
or (y) the failure of any person entitled to indemnification hereunder to
deliver or make available to a purchaser of Registrable Securities (to the
extent required by law), a copy of any registration statement, including any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments
or supplements thereto (if the same was required by applicable law to be
delivered or made available), _provided_ , that the Company shall have timely
delivered to the applicable Selling Holder such registration statement,
including such preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein
and any amendments or supplements thereto. The Company shall also indemnify
underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry
professionals participating in the distribution, their officers, directors,
agents and employees and each person who controls such persons (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act)
to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of
the Selling Holders. 

 



-10- 6.2. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Selling Holder shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its
officers who shall have signed the registration statement, each Person who
controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, each
underwriter or Agent in any underwritten or agented offering and each Person
who controls such underwriter or Agent within the meaning of the Securities
Act, and each officer, director, partner and employee of such underwriter or
Agent or such controlling Person, against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (joint and several), including attorneys
fees and disbursements and expenses of investigation, incurred by such party
pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, or to which any of the foregoing Persons may otherwise become
subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state
laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arise
out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case solely to the extent
that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by such Selling Holder or its Representatives or
controlling persons expressly for use in connection with such registration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the indemnification required by this
_Section 6.2_ shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or expense if settlement is effected without the
consent of the relevant Selling Holder of Registrable Securities, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (y) in
no event shall the amount of any indemnity under this  _Section 6.2_ exceed
the gross proceeds from the applicable offering received by such Selling
Holder.

6.3. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this _Section 6_
of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation
or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified party may make a
claim under this  _Section 6_, such indemnified party shall deliver to the
indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the
indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly given notice, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that an indemnified
party shall have the right to retain separate counsel in any such action,
claim or proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, _provided_ ,
that the indemnified party shall be responsible for its own fees and
disbursements and expenses unless representation of such indemnified party by
the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any
other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding (in which case the
indemnifying party shall pay such fees and disbursements and expenses of the
indemnified party and shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party). The failure
to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time
following the commencement of any such action, if and only to the extent
prejudicial to the indemnifying party, shall relieve such indemnifying party
of any liability to the indemnified party under this _Section 6_ to the
extent of such prejudice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnified party
will have the absolute right to conduct and control, through counsel of its
choosing (with the fees and disbursements and expenses to be paid by the
indemnifying party) the defense, compromise and settlement of any such action,
claim or proceeding if the indemnifying party does not elect to assume control
of the defense within thirty (30) days after receiving notice thereof;
_provided_ , that the indemnifying party shall be permitted to participate in
the defense thereof with its own counsel and at its own expense. No

 



-11-  indemnifying party shall be liable to an indemnified party for any
settlement of any action, proceeding or claim without the written consent of
the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. No indemnifying party shall consent to any settlement
of any action, proceeding or claim without the written consent of the
indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, that does not include the giving to such
indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect of
such action, proceeding or claim or that requires an admission of wrongdoing
by any indemnified party. 

6.4. If the indemnification required by this _Section 6_ from the
indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in
this _Section 6_:

(i) The indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions that
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any Violation has been committed by, or
relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified
parties, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such Violation. The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_, any legal or other
fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding.

 

(ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ were determined by _pro rata_
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in _Section 6.4(i)_. No
Person that is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

6.5. If indemnification is available under this _Section 6_, the indemnifying
parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in
this _Section 6_ without regard to the relative fault of such indemnifying
party or indemnified party or any other equitable consideration referred to in
_Section 6.4_.

 

6.6. The obligations of the Company and the Selling Holders of Registrable
Securities under this _Section 6_ shall survive the completion of any
offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration statement under
this Agreement, and otherwise until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations.

 

Section 7\. _Transfer of Registration Rights_. All rights of a Holder with
respect to Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement may be
Transferred by such Holder to any other Person in connection with the Transfer
of Registrable Securities to such Person, in all

 



-12-  cases, if and only if (x) any such Transferee that is not a party to this
Agreement shall have executed and delivered to the Secretary of the Company a
properly completed agreement substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ , and
(y) the Transferor shall have delivered to the Secretary of the Company, no
later than fifteen (15) days following the date of the Transfer, written
notification of such Transfer setting forth the name of the Transferor, name
and address of the Transferee, and the number of Registrable Securities that
shall have been so Transferred.

 

Section 8\. _Holdback_. Each Holder entitled pursuant to this Agreement to
have Registrable Securities included in a Piggyback Registration statement
prepared pursuant to _Section 2.1_ of this Agreement, and each of the Company
and any other Person who requests the inclusion of securities in any Shelf
Registration, if so requested by the Underwriters Representative or Agent in
connection with an offering of any Registrable Securities, shall not effect
any public sale or distribution of shares of Common Stock or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock,
including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (except as part
of such underwritten or agented registration), during the fifteen (15)-day
period prior to, and up to ninety (90)-day period beginning on (but in any
event not longer than the period applicable to the Companys directors and
executive officers who are required by the Underwriters Representative or
Agent to be subject to similar restrictions), the date such registration
statement is declared effective under the Securities Act by the Commission;
_provided_ , that such Holder is timely notified of such effective date in
writing by the Company or such Underwriters Representative or Agent. In order
to enforce the foregoing covenant, the Company shall be entitled to impose
stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Registrable Securities until
the end of such period.

 

Section 9\. _Covenants_.

 

9.1. The Company shall file as and when applicable, on a timely basis, all
reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act. If the Company is
not required to file reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, upon the request of
any Holder of Registrable Securities, the Company shall make publicly
available the information specified in subparagraph (c)(2) of Rule 144 of the
Securities Act, and take such further action as may be reasonably required
from time to time and as may be within the reasonable control of the Company,
to enable the Holders to Transfer Registrable Securities without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by
Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any similar rule or regulation hereafter
adopted by the Commission.

 

9.2. The Company shall be entitled, upon written notice to the Holders, to
postpone (but not more than once in any fiscal year) for a reasonable period
not in excess of ninety (90) calendar days, the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend the use of, a Piggyback Registration statement or
a Shelf Registration Statement if the Company delivers to the Selling Holders
a certificate signed by an executive officer of the Company certifying that
in the good faith judgment of such officer such registration, offering or use
would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect or to
materially interfere with any material financing of the Company or any
material transaction under consideration by the Company or would require the
disclosure of information that has not been, and is not otherwise required to
be, disclosed to the public, the premature disclosure of which would
materially and adversely affect the Company.

 



-13-  No postponement or suspension shall apply during any period in which the
directors and executive officers of the Company are not also generally
prohibited from selling shares of Common Stock (other any sales made pursuant
to 10b5-1 plans then in existence). The Holders shall maintain in confidence
the existence and content of such notice or certificate. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.2_, no such suspension notice
may be given from the time of the first _bona_ _fide_ offer of Registrable
Securities pursuant to a registration hereunder as long as a prospectus is
required to be delivered in respect of such offer under the Securities Act.

9.3. The Company has not granted, and shall not grant, to any Person any
registration rights that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement.

herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company shall have obtained
the written consent of the Investor to such amendment, action or omission to
act.

 

(ii) No waiver of any terms or conditions of this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver of any other breach of such terms and conditions or any other term or
condition, nor shall any failure to enforce any provision hereof operate as a
waiver of such provision or of any other provision hereof. No written waiver
hereunder, unless it by its own terms explicitly provides to the contrary,
shall be construed to effect a continuing waiver of the provisions being
waived and no such waiver in any instance shall constitute a waiver in any
other instance or for any other purpose or impair the right of the party
against whom such waiver is claimed in all other instances or for all other
purposes to require full compliance with such provision.

(iii) Each of the parties hereto shall execute all such further instruments
and documents and take all such further action as any other party hereto may
reasonably require in order to effectuate the terms and purposes of this
Agreement.

 

Section 11\. _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective heirs, assigns, executors, administrators or
successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated by the Company or
Investor without the prior written consent of the other; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Investor may assign all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to an affiliate of Investor in connection with the
Transfer of all of its shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the
terms thereof. A Holder may Transfer its rights hereunder to a successor in
interest to the Registrable Securities owned by such assignor as permitted by
