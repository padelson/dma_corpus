This agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of September 13, 2004, is by and

WHEREAS, on September 12, 2004, SCA provided MGM with a proposed Agreement and
Plan of Merger (together with the changes agreed to by MGM and SCA on
September 13, 2004, the "Proposed Merger Agreement"), by and between MGM and
an entity ("Newco") to be formed by SCA, Providence Equity Partners IV, L.P.

Partners III, L.P. ("DLJ") and related documents;



NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:



1\. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meaning provided
in the Proposed Merger Agreement.



2\. SCA hereby acknowledges and agrees that (a) it is prepared to enter into
the Proposed Merger Agreement, subject only to "clean-up" changes, and (b) it
shall negotiate with MGM in good faith to promptly enter into binding
definitive documentation relating to the acquisition of MGM by Newco on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed Merger Agreement, subject only
to "clean-up" changes.



3\. MGM hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to receipt of
the Unconditional Non-Refundable Deposit (defined below), (a) its management
will recommend to the MGM Board of Directors that the Board of Directors
approve and adopt the Proposed Merger Agreement, subject only to "clean-up"
changes, and (b) it shall negotiate with SCA in good faith to promptly enter
into binding definitive documentation relating to the acquisition of MGM by
Newco on the terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed Merger Agreement,
subject only to "clean-up" changes.



4\. As a material inducement to the willingness of MGM to provide SCA,
Providence, TPG and DLJ with the outstanding informational materials
previously requested by SCA, Providence, TPG and DLJ, as well as access to MGM
officers and employees and to negotiate in good faith with respect to the
transaction contemplated by the Proposed Merger Agreement, SCA will remit
$150,000,000 (the "Unconditional Non-Refundable Deposit") in cash in
immediately available funds to the following account no later than Noon, New
York City time on Monday, September 13, 2004:



Bank Name: Bank of America

Bank Address: 1850 Gateway Blvd., Concord, California

ABA Number: 121000358

Account Name: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.

Account Number: 12357-08075

 5\. As promptly as practicable following receipt of the Unconditional Non-
Refundable Deposit, (a) MGM shall establish a separate account, which shall
include only the Unconditional Non-Refundable Deposit, and interest thereon,
and no other funds (the "Separate Account") at Bank of America in the name of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. and (b) MGM shall transfer the Unconditional Non-
Refundable Deposit to the Separate Account from the account specified in
Section 4 of this Agreement. No later than the first Business Day following
receipt of the Unconditional Non-Refundable Deposit by MGM, the Chief
Financial Officer of MGM shall certify in writing to SCA that such transfer
has occurred. SCA shall be entitled to receive a statement, upon its
reasonable request, of the amounts in the Separate Account.



6\. MGM shall not withdraw the Unconditional Non-Refundable Deposit (or
any portion thereof) from the Separate Account until the earlier of (a) 5:00
p.m. New York City time on September 27, 2004 (the "Deadline"), unless MGM has
entered into a binding definitive agreement and plan of merger (a "Definitive
Agreement") with Newco providing for the payment of merger consideration of at
least $12.00 per share to the holders of MGM common stock and (b) if MGM has
entered into a Definitive Agreement with Newco, termination of such
Definitive Agreement for any reason whatsoever.



7\. MGM shall return the Unconditional Non-Refundable Deposit to SCA upon the
earlier of (a) the Effective Time; (b) the occurrence of _both_ of the
following events: (i) MGM does not enter into a Definitive Agreement with
Newco _and_ (ii) within 270 days of the date of this Agreement, MGM enters
into a binding agreement with a Third Party (other than the Principal
Stockholders) providing for a Takeover Proposal (with all percentages in the
definition of Takeover Proposal increased to 50%); and (c) a court of
competent jurisdiction shall have determined that a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred. In the event MGM returns the Unconditional Non-Refundable
Deposit to SCA pursuant to this Section 7, then it shall also return
all interest and earnings thereon, which shall equal (a) the actual interest
and earnings thereon for such period as the Unconditional Non-Refundable
Deposit is held in the Separate Account and (b) deemed interest at a rate of
4% per annum for any period after the withdrawal of the Unconditional Non-
Refundable Deposit from the Separate Account through the date prior to the
return thereof to SCA.



8\. If (a) MGM enters into a Definitive Agreement with Newco _and_ (b) the
Definitive Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i)(A) thereof 
_and_ (c) there shall be a final, binding judgment from a court of competent
jurisdiction that MGM has willfully and materially breached the Definitive
Agreement and all rights of appeal from such judgment or other avenues of
review shall have been exhausted or lapsed, then the Unconditional Non-
Refundable Deposit shall be deemed to constitute damages resulting from such
willful and material breach.



 

9\. Promptly following notice of receipt of the Unconditional Non-Refundable
Deposit, MGM shall provide SCA, Providence, TPG and DLJ the
outstanding informational materials previously requested by SCA, Providence,
TPG and DLJ and shall make  



 

2  available to SCA, Providence, TPG and DLJ appropriate officers and employees
of MGM who are able to address any follow-up questions.



10\. SCA hereby acknowledges and agrees that MGM shall have no
obligation whatsoever to return all or any portion of the Unconditional Non-
Refundable Deposit to SCA or any other person or entity for any reason except
as set forth in this Agreement.



11\. SCA hereby agrees not to sue MGM to prevent the withdrawal of the
Unconditional Non-Refundable Deposit in accordance with the terms hereof.

shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
such counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same
counterpart.



13\. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions provided for herein shall be brought solely in
the Federal courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware;
_provided_ that if (and only after) such courts determine that they lack
subject matter jurisdiction over any such legal action, suit or proceeding,
such legal action, suit or proceeding shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York;  _provided_ , _further_
, that if (and only after) both the Federal courts of the United States
located in the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the

jurisdiction over any such legal action, suit or proceeding, such legal
action, suit or proceeding shall be brought in the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
provided for herein, and hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense
in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such courts, that the action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action,
suit or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions
provided for herein may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party
agrees that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions provided for
herein shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner
contemplated by Section 14. In addition, each of the parties hereto waives any
