 Holdco shall issue and deliver to the Exchange Agent (for the account and
benefit of the former holders of SPAC Units, SPAC Class A Common Shares and

Common Shares contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.01_.

reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Dutch Holdco Common Shares occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing.

(e)  _Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any Party shall be liable to any Person in respect of the consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any SPAC
Securities shall not have been surrendered or transferred, respectively, prior
to the date on which any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement in
respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable Law, any such consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such SPAC Securities shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Dutch
Holdco, and any former holders of SPAC Securities who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article_ __ _ II_ with respect thereto shall thereafter
look only to Dutch Holdco for payment of their claim for consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 2.05 _Tax Treatment of SPAC Merger_.

 

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local Tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax treatment), the
Parties shall not take or cause to be taken any action, or knowingly fail to
take or cause to be taken any action, which action or failure to act would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Dutch Holdco Contribution and the
SPAC Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(F) of the Code. By executing this Agreement, the Parties hereby
adopt a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3 with respect to the Dutch Holdco Contribution
and the SPAC Merger, and each Party that is a corporation that is a party to
the plan of reorganization (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) intends to file the statement required by Treasury Regulations

(b) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file
all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 2.05_ and shall not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or
during the course of any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law following a final
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other administrative
settlement with (or final administrative decision by) the relevant Taxing
Authority.

 

SECTION 2.06 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, SPAC, Dutch Holdco and New SPAC shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to Seller or any holder of SPAC Securities, any amount required to be deducted
or withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , if SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC reasonably
determines that any such deduction or withholding is required from the
consideration otherwise payable to Seller, SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC
shall use its reasonable best efforts to notify Seller reasonably in advance
of the Closing and cooperate in good faith with Seller to reduce or eliminate
any such deduction or withholding to the extent permissible under applicable
Law. To the extent that amounts are properly deducted or withheld by SPAC,
Dutch Holdco and New SPAC, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made
by SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 2.07 _Earnout_. Following the Closing, Seller may be entitled to
additional consideration for the Share Contribution as set forth on, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, _Exhibit_ __ _ F_.

SECTION 5.07  _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley_.

(a) SPAC has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and
other documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since October 6,
2020, together with any amendments, restatements or supplements
thereto (collectively, the " _SPAC SEC Reports_ "). SPAC has heretofore
furnished to the Company true and correct copies of all amendments and
modifications that have not been filed by SPAC with the SEC to all agreements,
documents and other instruments that previously had been filed by SPAC with
the SEC and are currently in effect. As of their respective dates, the SPAC
SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not,
at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading, in the case of any SPAC SEC Report that is
a registration statement, or include any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, in the case of any other SPAC SEC Report. Each director and
executive officer of SPAC has filed with the SEC on a timely basis all
documents required with respect to SPAC by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the SPAC SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with
GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, as
applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows of SPAC as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which have not

 



47

    

 had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or in the
aggregate be material). SPAC has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are
not disclosed in the SPAC SEC Reports. No financial statements other than
those of SPAC are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of SPAC.

 

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the SPAC SEC Reports, none of
SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC has any liability or obligation of a nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to be reflected

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to
September 30, 2020; (B) liabilities for fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange.

 

(e) SPAC has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to SPAC
and other material information required to be disclosed by SPAC in the reports
and other documents that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to SPACs principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting SPACs principal executive officer
and principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in SPACs periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

 

(f) SPAC maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting that
are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that SPAC maintains records that
in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all material respects,
its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board of
directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements. SPAC has delivered to the Company a true
and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) by
any representative of SPAC to SPACs independent auditors relating to any
material weaknesses in internal controls and any significant deficiencies in
the design or operation of internal controls that would adversely affect the
ability of SPAC to record, process, summarize and report financial data. SPAC
has no knowledge of any fraud or whistle-blower allegations, whether or not
material, that involve management or other employees or consultants who have
or had a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting of
SPAC. Since March 31, 2020, there have been no material changes in SPACs
internal control over financial reporting.

 



48

    

(g) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by SPAC
to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of SPAC, and SPAC has not taken any action prohibited by Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(h) Neither SPAC (including any employee thereof) nor SPACs independent
auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency
or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls utilized by
SPAC, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves SPACs management
or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial statements
or the internal accounting controls utilized by SPAC or (iii) any claim or
allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

 

(i) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding SEC comments from the SEC
with respect to the SPAC SEC Reports. To the knowledge of SPAC, none of the
SPAC SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof is subject to ongoing
SEC review or investigation as of the date hereof.

 

SECTION 5.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2019
and prior to the date of this Agreement, except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, SPAC has conducted its business in all material respects in
the ordinary course of business.

 

SECTION 5.09 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of SPAC, threatened against SPAC, or any property or asset of SPAC,
before any Governmental Authority. Neither SPAC nor any material property or
asset of SPAC is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the
knowledge of SPAC, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority.

SECTION 5.11 _No Prior Operations_ __. Dutch Holdco was formed on December 2,
2020 and New SPAC was formed on December 2, 2020. Since its inception,
neither Dutch Holdco nor New SPAC has engaged in any activity, other than such
actions in connection with (i) its organization and (ii) the preparation,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated
hereby. Neither Dutch Holdco nor New SPAC has operations, has generated any
revenues or has any liabilities other than those incurred in connection with
the foregoing and in association with the Transactions.

SECTION 5.12 _Brokers_. Except as set forth on Section 5.12 of the

SECTION 5.13 _SPAC Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement, SPAC has no
less than $350,000,000 in the trust fund established by SPAC for the benefit
of its public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ") (including, if applicable,
an aggregate of approximately $12,250,000 of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions being held in the Trust Fund) maintained in a trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Trust Account_ "). The monies of such
Trust Account are invested in United States Government securities or
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and held in trust by
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to
the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of October 9, 2020,
between SPAC and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement
has not been amended or modified and is valid and in full force and effect
and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies
Exceptions. SPAC has complied in all material respects with the terms of the
Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there
does not exist any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of

50

    

 or default by SPAC or the Trustee. There are no separate contracts,
agreements, side letters or other agreements or understandings (whether
written or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between SPAC and the Trustee
that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the SPAC SEC
Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect; or (ii) that would entitle
any Person (other than stockholders of SPAC who shall have elected to redeem
their SPAC Class A Common Shares pursuant to the SPAC Organizational
Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except:
(A) to pay any Taxes owned by SPAC as a result of assets of SPAC or interest
or other income earned on the assets of the SPAC; and (B) upon the exercise of
Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions of the
SPAC Organizational Documents. To SPACs knowledge, as of the date of this
Agreement, following the Closing, no stockholder of SPAC shall be entitled to
receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent such
stockholder is exercising its Redemption Rights. There are no Actions pending
or, to the knowledge of SPAC, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust
Account. Upon consummation of the Transactions and notice thereof to the
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, SPAC shall cause the Trustee to, and
the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to SPAC as promptly as
practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust Agreement at which
point the Trust Account shall terminate; provided, however that the
liabilities and obligations of SPAC due and owing or incurred at or prior to
the Closing shall be paid as and when due, including all amounts payable (a)
to stockholders of SPAC who shall have exercised their Redemption Rights, (b)
with respect to filings, applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to
this Agreement required under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and costs
incurred in accordance with the Trust Agreement, and (d) to third parties
(e.g., professionals, printers, etc.) who have rendered services to SPAC in
connection with its efforts to effect the Transactions. SPAC has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account
will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be
available to SPAC at the Closing.

SECTION 5.14  _Employees_. Other than any officers as described in the SPAC
SEC Reports, SPAC has no employees, and has not retained any contractors,
other than consultants and advisors in the Ordinary Course. Other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by SPACs officers and
directors in connection with activities on SPACs behalf in an aggregate
amount not in excess of the amount of cash held by SPAC outside of the Trust
Account, SPAC has no unsatisfied material liability with respect to any
officer or director. SPAC has never and does not currently maintain, sponsor,
or contribute to any Employee Benefit Plan.

58

    

Nothing herein shall require the SPAC to obtain consent from the Company to do
any of the foregoing if obtaining such consent might reasonably be expected
to violate applicable Law, and nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_
shall give to the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or

efforts to maintain each Subscription Agreement in full force and effect (and
SPAC shall not take any action to cause any Subscription Agreement not to be
in full force and effect and shall not refrain from taking any commercially
reasonable action necessary to maintain each Subscription Agreement in full
force and effect). From the date of this Agreement to the Closing, SPAC shall
use reasonable best efforts to maintain each Forward Purchase Agreement in
full force and effect (and SPAC shall not take any action to cause any
Forward Purchase Agreement not to be in full force and effect and shall not
refrain from taking any commercially reasonable action necessary to maintain
each Forward Purchase Agreement in full force and effect), it being
understood that this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(b)_ shall not in any manner limit or
restrict in any respect the ability to syndicate the obligations set forth in
the Forward Purchase Agreements in accordance with the terms thereof.

SECTION 6.03 _Claims Against Trust Account_. Each of Seller and the Company
agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
neither the Company nor Seller now has, and shall not at any time prior to the
Closing have, any claim to, or make any claim against, the Trust Fund,
regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or
relating in any way to, the business relationship between Seller or the
Company on the one hand, and SPAC on the other hand, this Agreement, or any
other agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim
arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability
(any and all such claims are collectively referred to in this _Section_ __ _
6.03_ as the " _Claims_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision contained in
this Agreement, each of Seller and the Company hereby irrevocably waives any
Claim it and its Affiliates may have, now or in the future and will not seek
recourse against the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in respect thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing waiver will not limit or prohibit
the Company or Seller from pursuing a claim against SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New
SPAC or any other person (a) for legal relief against monies or other assets
of SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC held outside of the Trust Account (including
any funds that have been released from the Trust Account and any assets that
have been purchased or acquired with any such funds) or for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the Transactions
(including a claim for SPAC to specifically perform its obligations under this
Agreement and cause the disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in
the Trust Account (after giving effect to the Redemption Rights)) or for fraud
or (b) for damages for breach of this Agreement against SPAC, Dutch Holdco,
New SPAC or any of their respective successor entities in the event this
Agreement is terminated for any reason and SPAC consummates, directly or
indirectly, a business combination transaction, whether by way of a purchase
of assets or securities or merger, consolidation or otherwise, with
another party. In the event that Seller, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates commences any action or proceeding against or involving
the Trust Fund in violation of the foregoing, SPAC shall be entitled to
recover from Seller and the Company the associated reasonable legal fees and
costs in connection with any such action, in the event SPAC prevails in such
action or proceeding.

ARTICLE VII.

 

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

SECTION 7.01 _Registration Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, SPAC and
Seller shall prepare and mutually agree upon (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by Seller), and SPAC shall cause
Dutch Holdco to file with the SEC, a registration statement on Form F-4
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as amended from
time to time, the " _Registration Statement / Proxy Statement_ ") (it being
understood that the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement shall include a
proxy statement / prospectus which will be included therein as a prospectus
with respect to Dutch Holdco and which will be used as a proxy statement with
respect to the SPAC Stockholders Meeting to adopt and approve the Transaction
Proposals (as defined below) and other matters reasonably related to the
Transaction Proposals, all in accordance with and as required by SPACs
Organizational Documents, any related agreements with Sponsor and its
Affiliates, applicable Law, and any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange). Each of SPAC and Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to: (i) cause the Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement to comply in all material respects with the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC (including, with respect to the Company,
and without limitation, by using its reasonable best efforts to deliver true
and complete copies of the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019,
and the related audited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such years, each prepared in
accordance with GAAP and audited in accordance with the auditing standards of
the PCAOB and the associated audit reports and consents of the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm); (ii) promptly notify the other
of, cooperate with each other with respect to and respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff; (iii) have the Registration Statement /
Proxy Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after it is filed with the SEC; and (iv) keep the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement effective through the Closing in
order to permit the consummation of the Transactions. Each of SPAC and Seller
shall promptly furnish the other all information concerning such Party,
its Subsidiaries, Representatives and shareholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.01_; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither SPAC nor
Seller shall use any such information for any purposes other than those
contemplated by this Agreement unless: (A) such Party obtains the prior
written consent of the other to such use (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); or (B) to the extent that use
of such information is required to avoid violation of applicable Law. SPAC
shall cause Dutch Holdco to promptly advise the Company of the time of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, the issuance
of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of
the Dutch Holdco Common Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and
each of SPAC and Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 



60

    

(b) SPAC represents that the information supplied by SPAC for inclusion in the
Registration Statement / Proxy Statement shall not include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, at (i) the time the Registration
Statement / Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto)
is first mailed to the stockholders of SPAC, (ii) the time of the SPAC
Stockholders Meeting and (iii) the Closing. If, at any time prior to the
Closing, any event or circumstance relating to SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC,
or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by SPAC which
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
SPAC shall promptly inform the Company. All documents that SPAC is responsible
for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions shall comply as to
form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

(c) The Company represents that the information supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement shall not include
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, at (i) the time the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first
mailed to the stockholders of SPAC, (ii) the time of the SPAC Stockholders
Meeting and (iii) the Closing. If, at any time prior to the Closing, any
event or circumstance relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or its
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company, as
applicable, shall promptly inform SPAC. After the Closing, all documents that
the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the
Transactions shall comply as to form and substance in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

SECTION 7.02 _SPAC Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_. SPAC shall: (i) take all
action necessary under applicable Law and the SPAC Organizational Documents to
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_SPAC Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ ") to seek (A) adoption and approval of this
Agreement by the holders of SPAC Common Shares in accordance with applicable
Law and exchange rules and regulations and the approval of the issuance of
SPAC Common Shares in accordance herewith, (B) approval of the provisions of
the organizational documents of Dutch Holdco as such approval may be required
under applicable Law, (C) approval of the SPAC Merger, (D) approval of the
issuance of SPAC Class A Common Shares in the Private Placements as such
approval may be required under applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange
and (E) approval of any other proposals reasonably agreed by SPAC and the
Company to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (such proposals in _clauses_ __ _ (A)_ through _(E)_ ,
together, the " _Transaction Proposals_ ", such proposals in _clauses_ __ _
(A)_, _(B),_ _(D)_ and _(E)_ , together, the " _Ordinary Resolution Proposals_
" and such proposal in _clause_ __ _ (C)_, the " _Special Resolution
Proposal_ "), which SPAC Stockholders Meeting shall be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date the Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and conditioned upon such
declaration of effectiveness); and (ii) submit the Transaction Proposals to,
and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of such
Transaction Proposals from, such holders at the SPAC Stockholders Meeting.
SPAC shall, through the SPAC Board, include a statement in the Registration
Statement / Proxy Statement to the effect that the SPAC Board recommends that

 



61

    

 SPACs shareholders vote in favor of the Transaction Proposals (the " _SPAC
Board Recommendation_ "). The SPAC Board shall not change, withdraw, withhold,
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, the SPAC Board
Recommendation (a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the SPAC Board may make a Change in Recommendation in response to any
material event, change, fact, condition, occurrence or circumstance (A) that
does not relate to an Alternative Transaction and (B) (x) first occurring
after the date hereof or (y) first actually known (and not constructively
known) by the SPAC Board following the date hereof, if it determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to
make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach by the SPAC Board of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the SPAC Board may not make a Change in
Recommendation unless SPAC notifies Seller in writing at least three Business
Days before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the
reasons therefor, and negotiates, and causes its financial and legal advisors
to, negotiate with Seller in good faith during such three Business Day period
(to the extent Seller seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the
terms of the Transactions proposed by Seller and, following such good faith
negotiations, the SPAC Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that a failure to make a Change in Recommendation
would continue to be reasonably expected to constitute a breach by the SPAC
Board of its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, SPAC may adjourn the
SPAC Stockholders Meeting (1) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement is provided to SPACs shareholders or, if as of the time for which
the SPAC Stockholders Meeting is scheduled there are insufficient SPAC
Common Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting, (2) in order to solicit
additional proxies from shareholders of SPAC in favor of the adoption of each
of the Transaction Proposals or (3) if the SPAC Shareholder Redemption Amount
is such that the condition to closing in _Section_ __ _ 8.01(f)_ would not be
satisfied.

 

SECTION 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company and SPAC
shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to): (i) provide to the
other Party (and the other Partys officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives,
collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access at reasonable times
upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of such Party and its Subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly to the other Party
such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets,
liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such Party and its Subsidiaries as
the other Party or its Representatives may reasonably request. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Company nor SPAC shall be required to provide
access to or disclose information where the access or disclosure would
jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene
applicable Law (it being agreed that the Parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would
not result in such jeopardy or contravention).

 

(b) All information obtained by the Parties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.03_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Mutual Nondisclosure
Agreement, dated October 16, 2020 by and between the Company and TPG Global,
LLC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



62

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Party
(and its respective Representatives) may consult any Tax advisor as is
reasonably necessary regarding the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Transactions and may disclose to such advisor as if reasonably necessary, the
intended Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Transactions and all
materials (including any Tax analysis) that are provided relating to such
treatment or structure, in each case in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.04 _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement and ending on the
earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article IX, the Parties shall not, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) enter into, solicit, initiate or continue any discussions or
negotiations with, or encourage or respond to any inquiries, indications of
interest, offers or proposals by, or participate in any negotiations with, or
provide any information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
Person or other entity or "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, concerning an Alternative Transaction, (ii) enter into any
agreement regarding, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way that would otherwise reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Alternative Transaction or (iii) commence, continue or renew any due
diligence investigation regarding any Alternative Transaction; provided that
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
not be deemed a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_. For purposes of this
Agreement, an " _Alternative Transaction_ " shall mean (A) with respect to
Seller and the Company, (x) the issuance, sale or transfer to or investment
by any Person in any newly issued or currently outstanding equity interest in
the Company, (y) the sale or transfer of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any Person, or (z) any merger or business combination between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any other Person,
on the other hand and (B) with respect to SPAC, Dutch Holdco and New SPAC, any
direct or indirect acquisition of assets of business of any person, whether
by way of a purchase of assets or securities or merger, consolidation or
otherwise, such as the "initial business combination" under SPACs initial IPO
prospectus with any third party. Each Party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Affiliates and Representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction. Each
Party also agrees that it shall promptly request each Person (other than the
Parties and their respective Representatives) that has prior to the date
hereof executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of an Alternative Transaction to return or destroy all
confidential information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it prior
to the date hereof (to the extent so permitted under, and in accordance with
the terms of, such confidentiality agreement). If a Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives receives any
inquiry or proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction at any time
prior to the Closing, then such Party shall promptly (and in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after such Party becomes aware of such inquiry or
proposal) notify such Person in writing that such Party is subject to an
exclusivity agreement with respect to the Transaction that prohibits such
Party from considering such inquiry or proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Parties agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ by a Party or any of its Subsidiaries or its or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ by such Party. The Parties agree that this
Section 7.04 shall supersede that certain Exclusivity Agreement entered into
by and among SPAC, the Company and Seller dated November 17, 2020 in its
entirety and such Exclusivity Agreement shall be terminated as of the date
hereof.

 



63

    

SECTION 7.05 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Dutch Holdco shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, provide
the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who remain employed
immediately after the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and determining the level of
benefits, as applicable, under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by Dutch Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding any retiree health plans or programs, or defined
benefit retirement plans or programs) for service accrued or deemed accrued
prior to the Closing with the Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided,
however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any such benefit. In addition, subject to the terms
of all governing documents, SPAC shall use reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under each of the employee benefit plans established or
maintained by Dutch Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries that cover the
Continuing Employees or their dependents, and (ii) cause any eligible expenses
incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, during
the portion of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, under those health
and welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee currently
participates to be taken into account under those health and welfare benefit
plans in which such Continuing Employee participates subsequent to the
Closing Date for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance, and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year. Following the
Closing, Dutch Holdco shall honor all accrued but unused vacation and other
paid time off of the Continuing Employees that existed immediately prior to
the Closing with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

(b) Prior to the filing of the definitive Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement, SPAC shall in good faith consider the adoption of a customary
equity incentive plan that is reasonably acceptable to the Company.

 

(c) To the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates elects to cause any
incentive compensation award that is outstanding under any Incentive Plan
immediately prior to Closing (the " _First Incentive Tranche_ ") to become
payable to the participant as of or in connection with the Closing (or as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions), Seller shall contribute cash
to the Company as necessary to fully fund the payment obligations of the First
Incentive Tranche prior to the Closing (which contribution shall be in
addition to the contributions required by _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_).

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ are solely for the benefit of
the Parties to the Agreement, and nothing contained in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or legal
representative or beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other Person, any
rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement, whether as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise, including,
without limitation, any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or level of compensation or benefits. Nothing contained in
this Agreement, express or implied, shall constitute an amendment or
modification of any employee benefit plan of the Company or shall require the
Company, SPAC, New SPAC or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue
any Plan or other employee benefit arrangements, or prevent their amendment,
modification or termination.

 



64

    

(e) Prior to the Closing, Dutch Holdco and Seller shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain (i) a duly executed termination agreement relating to the
employment agreement and the management agreement of the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company in force and effect as of the date hereof and (ii) a
management agreement to be entered into by and between Dutch Holdco or one of
its Affiliates and such Chief Executive Officer on terms at least as favorable
to the Chief Executive Officer as those of such existing agreements, at the
date of this Agreement (other than as necessary to comply with applicable
Law), in each case subject to and effective as of Closing and on terms
approved by Dutch Holdco.

 

SECTION 7.06 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Indemnification_.

(a) Following the Closing, the articles of association of the Company, SPAC,
or Dutch Holdco shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified with
respect to indemnification, advancement or expense reimbursement for a period
of six years from the Closing in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Closing, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, SPAC or
Dutch Holdco (as applicable), unless such modification shall be required by
applicable Law. Dutch Holdco further agrees that with respect to
the provisions of the bylaws or limited liability company agreements of the
Company Subsidiaries relating to indemnification, advancement or expense
reimbursement, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Closing in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Closing, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of such
Company Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required by applicable
Law. For a period of six years from the Closing, Dutch Holdco agrees that it
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the Company, SPAC and Dutch Holdco against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Closing, to the fullest extent that the Company, SPAC or Dutch
Holdco (as applicable) would have been permitted under applicable Law and the
organizational documents of the Company, SPAC or Dutch Holdco (as applicable)
in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including
the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law).

(b) For a period of six years from the Closing, Dutch Holdco shall maintain in
effect directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_")
covering those Persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors
and officers primary liability insurance policy (true, correct and complete
copies of which have been heretofore made available to SPAC or its agents or
Representatives in the Virtual Data Room) on terms not less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage, except that in no event shall Dutch
Holdco be required to pay a premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of
the aggregate annual premium attributable to the Company for coverage of the
Company under such insurance policy for the year ended 

 



65

    

 December 31, 2019 (the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "). If the premium of such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Annual Premium, then Dutch Holdco shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Closing, the Company may
purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance carrier so long as the
aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Closing, Dutch Holdco shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect for a period of no less than six years after the Closing and continue
to honor its obligations thereunder. If the Company is unable to obtain the
"tail" policy and Dutch Holdco is unable to obtain the insurance described in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.06(b)_ for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum
Annual Premium, SPAC shall instead obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for a one-time premium equal to the Maximum Annual Premium. From and
after the date of this Agreement, Dutch Holdco, SPAC, and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith with respect to any efforts to obtain the
insurance described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.06(b)_, including but not
limited to providing access to insurance broker presentations, underwriter
quotes for such insurance, and draft policies for such insurance.

 

(c) Prior to or in connection with the Closing, SPAC or Dutch Holdco may
purchase a prepaid "tail" policy (a " _SPAC Tail Policy_ ") with respect to
the DandO Insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by SPACs
DandO Insurance policies. If SPAC or Dutch Holdco elects to purchase such a SPAC
Tail Policy prior to or in connection with the Closing, Dutch Holdco will
maintain such SPAC Tail Policy in full force and effect for a period of no
less than six years after the Closing and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder.

 

(d) Prior to or in connection with the Closing, notwithstanding the
obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.13(c)_ of this Agreement, Dutch
Holdco shall purchase "go-forward" DandO Insurance to cover the post-Closing
directors and officers of Dutch Holdco. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Dutch Holdco, SPAC, and the Company shall cooperate in good faith
with respect to any efforts to obtain the insurance described in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.06(d)_, including but not limited to providing access to
insurance broker presentations, underwriter quotes for such insurance, and
draft policies for such insurance.

(e) On the Closing Date, Dutch Holdco shall enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and
Dutch Holdco with the post-Closing directors and officers of Dutch Holdco,
which indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective following the
Closing. 

SECTION 7.07 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Seller shall give prompt
notice to SPAC, and SPAC shall give prompt notice to Seller, of any event
which a Party becomes aware of between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article_ __ _ IX_), the occurrence or non-occurrence of which causes or
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Article_ __ _ VIII_ to fail.

 



66

    

SECTION 7.08 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, such things as are
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise, and each
shall cooperate with the other, to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including, without limitation, using its reasonable best efforts
to obtain all permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
orders of, and the expiration or termination of waiting periods
by, Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ necessary for
the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to
the Transactions. In case, at any time after the Closing, any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of each Party shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take all such action. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Parties agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts
(except where a different efforts standard is specifically contemplated by
this Agreement, in which case such different standard shall apply) to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and cause the conditions to the Closing set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VIII_ to be satisfied.

(b) Each of the Parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other
Parties of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permitting the other Parties to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such Party to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. No Party to
this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting, or video or
telephone conference, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting or conference. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Parties shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
Parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties shall provide each
other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications,
including any documents, information and data contained therewith, between
them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions contemplated hereby. No Party shall take or cause to be taken any
action before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with or intended
to delay its action on requests for a consent or the consummation of the
Transactions.

(c) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing,
SPAC shall use its reasonable best efforts to (a) consummate the Private
Placement in accordance with the Subscription Agreements and (b) consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Forward Purchase Agreements in accordance
with the terms thereof, and in each case Seller and the Company shall
cooperate with SPAC in such efforts. SPAC shall not, without the prior written
consent of Seller, permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or
modification to any

 



67

    

 Subscription Agreement or Forward Purchase Agreement if such amendment,
supplement or modification (x) reduces the aggregate amount of proceeds
contemplated by the Private Placements, (y) amends the conditions precedent
to the obligations of the Investors to consummate the Private Placements in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the
closing of the Private Placements or (z) otherwise adversely impacts Seller
in any material respect.

SECTION 7.09 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been
agreed to by each of SPAC and Seller. Thereafter, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_) unless otherwise prohibited by
applicable Law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, each Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with each other Party before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements (including
through social media platforms) with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement (including through social media platforms) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Furthermore, nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.09_ shall prevent SPAC or the Company and/or their
respective Affiliates from furnishing customary or other reasonable
information concerning the Transactions to their investors and prospective
investors that is substantively consistent with public statements previously
consented to by the other Party in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
7.09_.

SECTION 7.10 _Stock Exchange Listing_. From the date of this Agreement
through the SPAC Merger Effective Time, the Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to ensure that SPAC remains listed as a public company on, and for
SPAC Common Shares to be tradable over, the New York Stock Exchange. From the
date of this Agreement through the Closing, the Parties shall use reasonable
best efforts to have Dutch Holdco listed on the New York Stock Exchange as of
the Closing.

 

SECTION 7.11 _Antitrust_.

 

(a) To the extent required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade, including the HSR Act (" _Antitrust Laws_ "), each
Party agrees to promptly make any required filing or application under
Antitrust Laws, as applicable, and no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, Seller and SPAC each shall file (or cause to be
filed) with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission a Notification and Report From as required by
the HSR Act. The Parties agree to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to Antitrust Laws and to take all other actions necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods or obtain required approvals, as applicable under Antitrust Laws as
soon as practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting
period provided for under the HSR Act.

 



68

    

(b) SPAC and Seller each shall, in connection with its efforts to obtain all
requisite approvals and expiration or termination of waiting periods for the
Transactions under any Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to: (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other Party or its Affiliates in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private Person; (ii) keep the other reasonably informed of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental
Authority and of any communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions, and promptly furnish the other with copies of all such
written communications (with the exception of the filings, if any, submitted
under the HSR Act); (iii) permit the other to review in advance any written
communication to be given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or video or telephonic conference with, any Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or
other Person, give the other the opportunity to attend and participate in
such in person, video or telephonic meetings and conferences; (iv) in the
event a Party is prohibited from participating in or attending any in person,
video or telephonic meetings or conferences, the other shall keep such Party
promptly and reasonably apprised with respect thereto; and (v) use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate in the filing of any memoranda, white papers,
filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending the Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument, and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Authority; _provided_ that materials required to be provided pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.11(b)_ may be restricted to outside counsel and may
be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company,
and (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements.

 

(c) No Party shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect or materially delay the approval of any
Governmental Authority, or the expiration or termination of any waiting
period under Antitrust Laws, including by agreeing to merge with or acquire
any other Person or acquire a substantial portion of the assets of or equity
in any other Person. The Parties further covenant and agree, with respect to
a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of the Parties to consummate the Transactions,
to use reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 7.12 _Trust Account_. At least 48 hours prior to the Closing, SPAC
shall provide notice to the Trustee in accordance with the Trust Agreement
and shall deliver any other documents, opinions or notices required to be
delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement and cause the Trustee
prior to the Closing to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to,
transfer all funds held in the Trust Account to SPAC and thereafter shall
cause the Trust Account and the Trust Agreement to terminate.

 

SECTION 7.13 _Certain Actions_.

 

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take such action and make
such payments as may be necessary so that, as of the Closing, there shall be
no Seller Intercompany Debt and no Seller Intercompany Payables; _provided_
that, subject to Sellers compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_, at
Closing, Dutch Holdco shall cause the Company or the applicable Company
Subsidiary to repay up to a maximum of EUR 15,000,000 of Seller Intercompany
Debt that is outstanding and payable to Seller as of the date hereof and set
forth on Schedule 7.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (it
being understood that any Seller Intercompany Debt in excess

 



69

    

 of EUR 15,000,000 shall immediately prior to Closing be converted by Seller
into non-stipulated share premium ( _agio_ ) of the Company such that
there is no Seller Intercompany Debt outstanding following the Closing taking
into account the repayment contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(a)_);
_provided_ , _further_ , that for purposes of calculating any
repayment obligation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(a)_, an exchange
rate of 1 EUR to 1.21 U.S. dollars shall be utilized.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, terminate or cause to be terminated all of the agreements
required to be set forth on Section 4.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.13(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule). No such agreement (including any provision thereof which purports
to survive termination) shall be of any further force or effect after the
Closing, and all Company Group Members shall be released from all liabilities
thereunder effective as of the Closing.

 

(c) Prior to Closing, Seller and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Dutch Holdco in connection with Dutch Holdcos efforts to put in place
insurance policies with respect to the Company Group Members and their
respective assets on terms and conditions consistent in all material respects
(including pricing) with the Insurance Policies. After the Closing, Dutch
Holdco, on behalf of the Company Group Members, may pursue any claims or
losses covered under the Insurance Policies or any of their predecessor
insurance policies, (i) only with respect to claims that are made or losses
that occurred prior to the Closing, and if and only to the extent that such
claims or claims associated with such losses are claims or losses of a Company
Group Member, and (ii) if and only to the extent such claims or claims
associated with such losses may be made under the Insurance Policies. After
the Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonably efforts to cooperate
with Dutch Holdco in the pursuit of such claims. In the event that, after the
Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates receives insurance proceeds with
respect to any such claim, then, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt,
Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the account(s) designated by Dutch
Holdco an amount equal to such insurance proceeds.

 

(d) Prior to and following the Closing, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
in connection with the items set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.13(d)(i)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

(e) As a material inducement for SPAC and Dutch Holdco to enter into this
Agreement, and in order to protect the confidential and proprietary
information and the goodwill that is conveyed by Seller hereunder, Seller
hereby agree that Seller shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to),
prior to the Closing and during the one-year period commencing on the Closing
Date, employ or solicit for employment any individual employed by the Company
Group Members at any time during such one-year period. Each Party (A)
acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this _Section_ __ _
7.13(e)_ would give rise to irreparable harm, for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy, and (B) hereby agrees that, in the event of a
breach or a threatened breach of any such obligations, the non-breaching Party
shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific
performance and any other relief that may be available from a court of
competent jurisdiction (without any requirement to post bond). The Parties
mutually agree this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(e)_ is reasonable in all respects and
necessary to protect and preserve Dutch Holdcos legitimate business
interests and the value of the goodwill conveyed by Seller hereunder, and to
preserve the fair market value of

 



70

    

 the business conveyed hereunder. It is the desire and intent of the Parties
that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(e)_ (and portions thereof) be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Seller
acknowledges that this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(e)_ is reasonable and enforceable
in all respects; nonetheless, if any of the restrictions of this _Section_ __
_ 7.13(e)_ (or portions thereof) are found by an arbitrator or court of
competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, overly broad, or otherwise
unenforceable, the Parties intend that such restrictions (and portions
thereof) shall not be thereby terminated but shall be modified by such
arbitrator or court so as to be valid and enforceable and, as so modified, to
be fully enforced.

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Company and Seller shall use reasonable best
efforts to deliver to SPAC the financial statements contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 8.02(e)_. Prior to and, if such information has not already been
delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, following the
Closing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Dutch Holdco
true and complete copies of the audited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020, and the related
audited consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries for the year then ended, each audited in
accordance with the auditing standards of the PCAOB and prepared in
accordance with GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X
promulgated under the Securities Act, and the associated audit reports and
consents of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and
any additional information with respect to the Company for such periods prior
to Closing reasonably requested by Dutch Holdco to comply with disclosure
requirements under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, in each case
including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

(g) Without the prior written consent of Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), no Party shall (including
following Closing) (i) make an election under Section 336 or 338 of the Code
(or any similar provision of the Law of any state or other Taxing Authority)
with respect to the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries or (ii) make or
change any Tax election or accounting method or practice with respect to the
Company on a retroactive basis to, or with effect (or which deems transactions
to occur) in, any taxable period (or portion thereof) that ends on or before
Closing or the Closing Date.

(h) Following the Closing, Dutch Holdco shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to wind up and dissolve New SPAC reasonably promptly after the Closing
Date.

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain in
full force and effect all consents, approvals, ratifications, notices, waivers
or other authorizations required as a result of the consummation of the
Transactions under any contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party or by which any of their respective assets are bound, and shall
cooperate in good faith with all reasonable requests of SPAC related to the
same; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall be required to expend money (other than costs and expenses
associated with compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(i)_, which shall
not be considered Company Transaction Expenses), commence, defend or
participate in any litigation, or offer or grant any material accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with obtaining any
consent therefrom in connection with the Transactions. In connection with the
actions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(i)_, the Company shall not,
without

 



71

    

 the prior written consent of SPAC (which shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), enter into any (i) amendment to the
applicable contract or (ii) agreement, or otherwise agree to any
accommodation or concession that requires any payments by, or imposes any
obligations, liabilities or restrictions (including any limitations on
commercial or business activities) on, Dutch Holdco, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary prior to or following the Closing.

(j) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to, if so requested by SPAC, use reasonable best efforts
to separate the agreements set forth on _Section_ __ _ 7.13(j)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Separation Agreements_ ") such that the
relevant Company Group Members shall have entered into separate agreements
with the counterparties (instead of Seller or its applicable Affiliate (other
than a Company Group Member)) to the Separation Agreements, with effect no
later than Closing, so as to avoid any interruption to the applicable
commercial relationship as of and following the Closing. In connection
therewith, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to achieve the separation of the
Separation Agreements by Closing on substantially the same terms (including as
to scope of services, financial conditions, duration and termination rights)
as the Separation Agreements. In connection with the actions contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(j)_, (i) Seller shall not be required to make any
concessions to such counterparties to the Separation Agreements that would be
detrimental to the Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) to the extent that any of
the terms of any new agreement (including as to scope of services, financial
conditions, duration and termination rights) are less favorable than the terms
of the corresponding Separation Agreement, no Company Group Member
shall enter into such new agreement without the prior written consent of SPAC
(which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), and (iii)
Seller shall not agree to any accommodation or concession that requires any
payments by, or imposes any obligations, liabilities or restrictions
(including any limitations on commercial or business activities) on, Dutch
Holdco, the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to or following the
Closing, without the prior written consent of SPAC (which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Section_ __ _ 7.13(j)_, if any of the Separation
Agreements are not separated as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _
7.13(j)_ prior to Closing, including if no separation request is made by SPAC,
then, (i) the obligation of Seller to use reasonable best efforts to achieve
separation of the relevant Separation Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
7.13(j)_ shall continue for a period of six (6) months after the Closing, if
so requested by SPAC and (ii) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to keep
such Separation Agreement in effect and give the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary the benefit of such Separation Agreement in all respects
consistent with past practice including by maintaining such Separation
Agreement in full force and effect (and SPAC and the applicable Affiliate of
Seller shall in good faith enter into an agreement documenting such back-to-
back arrangement at Closing).

 

(k) Prior to the Closing, (i) Seller shall take all necessary steps such that
Dutch Holdco acquires the Company Shares from Seller, directly or indirectly,
at Closing (and any costs and expenses associated therewith, including any
purchase price payable with respect to any Company Shares, shall be borne by
Seller and shall not constitute Company Transaction Expenses
hereunder) including the taking of any valid and legally enforceable rights
available to Seller with respect thereto and (ii) Seller shall take all
reasonable steps necessary to cause Engie S.A., a _soci ete anonyme _organized
and existing under the laws of France, to enter into a preferred supplier
agreement in a form acceptable to SPAC with respect to electric vehicle
charging hardware and software.

 



72

    

(l) To the extent any COVID-19 Relief becomes due and payable prior to
Closing or it is determined that the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary
was ineligible to receive such COVID-19 Relief, Seller shall repay in full
such COVID-19 Relief prior to Closing (or Seller shall contribute cash in the
amount of such repayment obligation to the Company, which contribution shall
be in addition to the contributions required by  _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_ and
shall not be taken into account for purposes of the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(f)_). Within 30 days following the date hereof, Seller
shall cause the Company and each applicable Company Subsidiary to request
forgiveness in full of each COVID-19 Relief that, pursuant to the terms of
such COVID-19 Relief, is able to be forgiven. If any COVID-19 Relief does not
become due and payable prior to Closing, such COVID-19 relief shall remain an
obligation of the Company or applicable Company Subsidiary and be assumed by
Dutch Holdco in connection with Closing.

(m) Prior to Closing, Seller shall (i) cause any contingent
consideration payable pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement dated
July 5, 2018 between EV-Box France and Mr. Eric Stempin to be paid in full
prior to Closing or (ii) contribute cash to the Company in the amount of such
contingent consideration, which contribution shall be in addition to the
contributions required by _Section_ __ _ 6.01(b)_ and shall not be taken into
account for purposes of the conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(f)_
(it being understood that, if such contribution is made, the Company will
reimburse Seller for any amounts drawn after Closing under that certain
Guarantee dated July 27, 2018 issued by Seller for the benefit of Mr. Eric
Stempin that relate to the payment of such contingent consideration).

(n) To the extent any information, consultation or approvals are required to
consummate the Transactions under the Dutch Works Councils Act, the Company
shall promptly take all reasonable action (and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to take such action) to satisfy the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(h)_. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall
cooperate with all reasonable requests of SPAC related to the Dutch Works
Councils Act prior to Closing (including with respect to the establishment of
a works council).

behalf of any Party that either directly or indirectly through its Affiliates

76

    

 on or prior to the Outside Date; _provided, further_ , that SPAC, in its

consummation of the Transactions;

to receive the requisite vote for approval at the SPAC Stockholders Meeting;

untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.02(a)_ and _8.02(b)_ would not be satisfied (" _Terminating Company Breach_
"); provided that SPAC has not waived such Terminating Company Breach and
SPAC, Dutch Holdco and New SPAC are not then in material breach of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement;
provided further that, if such Terminating Company Breach is curable by Seller
or the Company, SPAC may not terminate this Agreement under this  _Section_
__ _ 9.01(e)_ for so long as Seller and the Company continue to exercise
their reasonable efforts to cure such breach, unless such breach is not cured
by the earlier of thirty (30) days after notice of such breach is provided by
SPAC to Seller and the Outside Date; or

(f) by Seller upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of SPAC, Dutch Holdco and New SPAC set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of SPAC, Dutch Holdco and New
SPAC shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set
forth in  _Sections_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ and _8.03(b)_ would not be satisfied ("
_Terminating SPAC Breach_ "); provided that the Company has not waived such
Terminating SPAC Breach and Seller and the Company are not then in material
breach of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this
Agreement; provided, however, that, if such Terminating SPAC Breach is curable
by SPAC, Dutch Holdco and New SPAC, Seller may not terminate this Agreement
under this _Section_ __ _ 9.01(f)_ for so long as SPAC, Dutch Holdco and New
SPAC continue to exercise their reasonable efforts to cure such breach, unless
such breach is not cured by the earlier of thirty (30) days after notice
of such breach is provided by Seller to the SPAC and the Outside Date.

 

SECTION 9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.01_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability under this Agreement on
the part of any Party, except as set forth in _Article_ __ _ X_, and any
corresponding definitions set forth in _Article_ __ _ I_, or in the case of
termination subsequent to a willful and material breach of this Agreement by a
Party or in the case of fraud.

 

SECTION 9.03 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
9.03_ or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _
7.13_), all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses; provided
that

 



77

    

 if the Closing shall occur, Dutch Holdco shall pay or cause to be paid, (i)
the SPAC Transaction Expenses and (ii) except as set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Section_ __ _ 7.13_), the Company Transaction Expenses.

 

SECTION 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended in writing by the
Parties at any time prior to the Closing. This Agreement may not be amended

extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of Seller
or the Company, (ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of Seller or the Company contained herein or in any document
delivered by Seller or the Company pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance
with any agreement of Seller or the Company or any condition to its own
obligations contained herein and (b) Seller may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC,
(ii) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of SPAC, Dutch
Holdco or New SPAC contained herein or in any document delivered by SPAC,
Dutch Holdco or New SPAC pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any
agreement of SPAC, Dutch Holdco or New SPAC or any condition to its own
obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be
bound thereby. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to
the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the
rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other
time. Neither the waiver by any of the Parties of a breach of or a default
under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the
Parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed
as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver
of any of such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. The rights and
remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights
or remedies that each Party may otherwise have at law or in equity.

SECTION 10.02 _Nonsurvival_ _of Representations_ , _Warranties and
Covenants_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
other agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising
out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations,
agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and all such
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements shall
terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Closing (and there shall be no
liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those
covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms expressly apply
in whole or in part after the Closing and then only with respect to any
breaches occurring after the Closing and (b) this _Article_ __ _ X_ and any
corresponding definitions set forth in  _Article_ __ _ I_.

SECTION 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
rule of law, or public policy, in whole or in part, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

SECTION 10.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede, except as set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)_, all prior and contemporaneous agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality
Agreement. Neither Party shall assign, grant or otherwise transfer the benefit
of the whole or any part of this Agreement or any of the rights hereunder
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of Law or otherwise) by any Party
without the prior express written consent of the other Parties.

 

SECTION 10.05 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than  _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

 



80

    

SECTION 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All legal actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;

of the State of Delaware, then any such Action may be brought in any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The
Parties hereby (a) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for themselves and with respect to their respective
properties for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any Party, and (b) agree not to commence any Action
relating thereto except in the courts described above in the State of
Delaware, other than Actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in the State
of Delaware as described herein. Each of the Parties further agrees that
notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and
the Parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not
to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in the State of Delaware as described herein for
any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

SECTION 10.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the Parties (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section_ __ _
10.07_. 

SECTION 10.08 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in
this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 10.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including executed manually or electronically via DocuSign or
other similar services and delivered by facsimile or portable document format
(pdf) transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different Parties
in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be
an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

 



81

    

SECTION 10.10 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof,
and, accordingly, that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the Parties
obligation to consummate the Transactions) without proof of actual damages or
otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity as expressly permitted in this Agreement. Each of the Parties
hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance
that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law
to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Outside Date any Party initiates an Action to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, then the Outside Date shall be automatically
extended by: (A) the amount of time during which such Action is pending plus
20 Business Days; or (B) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action.

 

SECTION 10.11 _No Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or
causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or
otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that
may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be
connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, or the negotiation, execution, or performance or non-
performance of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to, this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents), may be
made only against (and such representations and warranties are those solely
of) the Persons that are expressly identified as parties to this Agreement or
the applicable Transaction Document (the " _Contracting Parties_ ") except as
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_. In no event shall any Contracting
Party have any shared or vicarious liability for the actions or omissions of
any other Person. No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including without
limitation any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
financing source, attorney or Representative or assignee of any Contracting
Party, or any current, former or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
financing source, attorney or Representative or assignee of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise,
or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or
any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or their negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach, except with respect to willful misconduct or fraud against the Person
who committed such willful misconduct or fraud, and, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law; and each Party waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims, causes of action and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the

 



82

    

 Nonparty Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_
__ _ 10.11_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of the
Contracting Parties or any Nonparty Affiliate shall be responsible or liable
for any multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or
punitive damages which may be alleged as a result of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or
the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder, or the termination or
abandonment of any of the foregoing, except with respect to willful misconduct
or fraud against the Person who committed such willful misconduct or fraud,
and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.
