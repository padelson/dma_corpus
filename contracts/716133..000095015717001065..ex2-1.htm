WHEREAS each of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board of Directors
of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and determined that the Merger on the terms provided
for in this Agreement is advisable and in the best interests of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and its respective stockholders or

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of

WHEREAS concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company are entering into a

WHEREAS the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree as

ARTICLE I

  

  

 _The Merger_

  


 

  

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "),
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger. The Company, as the

_Surviving Corporation_ ".

  


 

  

SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall

by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in
Article VII do not remain satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) have
not been waived on such second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place
on the first Business Day thereafter on which all such conditions shall have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived; _provided_ ,
_further_ that, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions at such time), then, subject to the continued satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII at such time, the Closing
shall occur instead on the earliest of (i) any Business Day during the
Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two Business
Days' prior written notice to the Company, (ii) the second Business Day
following the final day of the Marketing Period or (iii) such other place,
time and date as may be agreed by the Company and Parent. The date on which

recordings or publications required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of
Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Secretary of State_ ") or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, at such
later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto prior to the filing of such
Certificate of Merger and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects

including Section 259, of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 1.05. _Charter and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

SECTION 1.06. _Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become

ARTICLE II

  


  _Effect on the Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

  


 

  

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock that

Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Company Common Stock held by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent (other than
Merger Sub) shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and shall be, at the election of Parent, either (i) converted into shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation or (ii) canceled. Each Excluded
Share shall be canceled at the Effective Time and, subject to Section 2.03, no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and
2.02(f), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have made and
not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (each such share of Company Common Stock, an " _Excluded Share_ "
and, collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the
right to receive any of the following forms of consideration (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "):

  


 

  

(i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive only Parent Common Shares (a " _Share Election_ ") has been validly
made and not revoked (collectively, the " _Share Election Shares_ "), the
right to receive 1.6305 fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Shares (the
" _Share Consideration_ ");

  

  

  

 

3  

  


 

  

(ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive both Parent Common Shares and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has
been validly made and not revoked (collectively, the " _Mixed Election Shares_
"), the right to receive (A) 0.6522 fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common
Shares (the " _Mixed Share Consideration_ ") plus (B) $18.45 in cash (the "
_Mixed Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Mixed Share Consideration,
the " _Mixed Consideration_ ");

  


 

  

(iii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive only cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been validly made and not
revoked (collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "), the right to receive
$30.75 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "); and

  


 

  

(iv) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a
Share Election, Mixed Election or Cash Election has been validly made and not
revoked (collectively, the " _Non-Election Shares_ ", and the failure to make
either a Share Election, Mixed Election or Cash Election, a " _Non-Election_
"), the right to receive the Mixed Consideration.

  


 

  

(d) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") (other than any Excluded Shares) and
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (other
than any Excluded Shares) shall, in each case, cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Common Shares_ " means the common
shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of
outstanding Parent Common Shares or shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of
Parent Common Shares or shares of Company Common Stock, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event. The right of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of
Section 2.02.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates; Book-Entry Shares_. (a) _Exchange
Agent_. Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) the aggregate number of
Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and (ii) an
amount of cash representing the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to
2.01(c). In addition, Parent shall deposit from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.02(f). All such Parent Common Shares and cash deposited with the Exchange

4  

  

  

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify subject to the Company's
reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto.

  


 

  

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii)
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the
receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together
with the associated Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) that number of whole
Parent Common Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) and/or (ii) an amount of immediately available funds equal to
(x) the cash amount that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) plus (y) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
holder has the right to receive pursuant to 2.02(f) plus (z) any dividends or
other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of Parent Common Shares pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), together with a check in the amount equal to any cash payable
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and any
dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued and/or paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common
Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with
respect thereto shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock were
entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

  

  

  

 

5  

  


 

  

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) with
respect to the number of Parent Common Shares issuable upon surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of such Certificate
(or such shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance
with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock
held in book-entry form), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional Parent Common Share to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole Parent Common Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares.

  


 

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(d) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates (or shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form). From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares
of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  


 

  

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent
Common Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who,
based on the Share Consideration or Mixed Share Consideration, as applicable,
would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Share (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such
holder, including shares that are the subject of valid affidavits of loss
thereof) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the closing sale price for
Parent Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) for the
trading day immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time.

  

  

  

 

6  

  


 

  

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Article II.

  


 

  

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such date on which the Exchange Fund otherwise would be required to
escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make all payments
of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses resulting
from investment of the funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall diminish
the rights of any holder of shares of Company Common Stock to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided herein.

  


 

  

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity by Parent and the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  


 

  

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Article II.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. _Dissenters ' Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Shares or cash or any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to the provisions of this Article II unless and
until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to dissent from the Merger
under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person who
otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to
dissent under Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall finally determine that the Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled to
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock, such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
treated as though such shares had been converted, as of the Effective Time,
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest and less
any required Tax withholding. For purposes of Section 2.01(c), such shares of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed Non-Election Shares and shall be entitled
to receive the Mixed Consideration. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
written notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law
received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal, and
(ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

SECTION 2.04. _Election Procedures_. (a) Each Person who, at or prior to the
Election Deadline, is a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock
(which, for purposes of this Section 2.04, shall include the holders of all
Cash-Out RSUs) shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article II, to submit an election on or prior to the Election Deadline in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.04.

  


 

  

(b) At the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to holders of record of
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting (the " _Mailing Date_ "), the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to mail an election form and other appropriate and customary
transmittal materials (which, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, upon adherence to the procedure set forth
in the Letter of Transmittal, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) (the " _Election
Form_ ") to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. Holders of record of Company
Common Stock who hold such Company Common Stock as nominees, trustee or in
other representative capacities may, through proper instructions and
documentation, submit a separate Election Form on or before the Election
Deadline with respect to each beneficial owner for whom such nominee, trustee
or representative holds such Company Common Stock.

  


 

  

(c) Each Election Form shall permit each Person who, at or prior to the
Election Deadline, is a record holder (or, in the case of nominee record
holders, the beneficial owner, through proper instructions and documentation)
of shares of Company Common Stock, other than any Dissenting Stockholder, to
specify (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder makes a Share Election, (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Mixed Election, and
(iii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such
holder makes a Cash Election.

  

  

  

 

8  

  


 

  

(d) Any shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has
not received an effective, properly completed Election Form at or before 5:00
p.m., New York time, on the Business Day that is one (1) Business Day
immediately preceding the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (or such
other date as may be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company) (the "
_Election Deadline_ "), shall be deemed to be Non-Election Shares. If the
Company Stockholders Meeting is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and the Company
shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Deadline. For the avoidance of doubt, any Non-Election Shares will
receive the Mixed Consideration.

  


 

  

(e) Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to make Election Forms available as
may be reasonably requested from time to time by all Persons who become
holders of record of Company Common Stock between the record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the Election Deadline, and the Company shall
provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for the
Exchange Agent to perform as specified in this Agreement and as specified in
any agreement between Parent and/or the Company and the Exchange Agent.

  


 

  

(f) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. After a Share Election, Mixed Election or Cash Election is
validly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, any
subsequent transfer of such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically
revoke such election. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the
Person submitting such Election Form, by written notice of such revocation
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Election
Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made and not
revoked with respect to any or all of such shares of Company Common Stock
prior to the Election Deadline. Any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VIII shall result in the revocation of all Election
Forms delivered to the Exchange Agent on or prior to the date of such
termination.

  


 

  

(g) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the
Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any
election or revocation has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in any submitted Election Form. Any good faith
determinations of the Exchange Agent (or, in the event that the Exchange Agent
declines to make any such determination, the joint determination of Parent and
the Company) regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of
Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to
notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form. The Exchange Agent (or,
in the event the Exchange Agent declines to make such computations, Parent and
the Company jointly) shall also make all computations contemplated by Sections
2.01(c), 2.02(f) and 2.05 hereof, and absent manifest error such computations
shall be conclusive and binding on Parent, the Company and all holders of
Company Common Stock.

  

  

  

 

9  

  


 

  

(h) The Company and Parent shall have the right to make rules, not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity and
effectiveness of Election Forms and Letters of Transmittal and the payment of
the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.05. _Proration_. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained
in this Agreement, within three Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the following prorations to the
Merger Consideration:

  


 

  

(i) If the Cash Election Amount is greater than the Available Cash Election
Amount, then each Cash Election Share and Cash Election RSU Share shall,
instead of being converted into the Cash Consideration, be converted into the
right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product
of (x) the Cash Consideration multiplied by (y) a fraction, (1) the numerator
of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and (2) the denominator
of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash
Fraction_ "), plus (B) a number of fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common
Shares equal to the product of (x) the Share Consideration multiplied by a
fraction equal to one minus the Cash Fraction.

  


 

  

(ii) If the Available Cash Election Amount is greater than the Cash Election
Amount, then each Share Election Share and Share Election RSU Share shall,
instead of being converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration,
be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to the amount of (x) such excess divided by (y) the number of
Share Election Shares and Share Election RSU Shares plus (B) a number of fully
paid and nonasssessable Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (x) the
Share Consideration multiplied by (y) a fraction, (1) the numerator of which
shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Consideration minus (II) the
amount calculated in clause (A) of this paragraph, and (2) the denominator of
which shall be the Cash Consideration.

  


 

  

ARTICLE III

  


  _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

  


 

  

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct
except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Parent SEC Documents_ ")

disclosures of risks that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in
the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company at or before the
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement (the "
_Parent Disclosure Letter_ "). The Parent Disclosure Letter shall be arranged
in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any section
shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this Article III to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections.

SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and each of
Parent's Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Parent
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and
possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ")
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted (the " _Parent
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have such power or authority or to
possess Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership, operation or leasing of its properties and assets makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent has made available to the Company, prior to execution of this
Agreement, true and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation of Parent in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Parent Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated Regulations of Parent in

SECTION 3.02. _Parent Subsidiaries_. (a) All the outstanding shares of capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, each Parent
Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
are wholly owned by Parent, by another Parent Subsidiary or by Parent and
another Parent Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,
mortgages, deeds of trust, encumbrances, judgments, options, rights of first
refusal or offer, defects in title and security interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), and free of any other
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests),
except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws. Parent has
provided to the Company a true and complete list of all Parent Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Parent Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, or any interest convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or voting securities of,
or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation, partnership, company,
limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association or other entity.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.03. _Capital Structure_. (a) The authorized capital stock of Parent
consists of 96,000,000 Parent Common Shares, 1,357,299 shares of voting

and 1,000,000 shares of non-voting preferred shares, without par value ("

for Outside Directors (the " _Parent Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside
Directors_ "). Except as set forth in this Section 3.03(a), at the close of
business on the Capitalization Date, no shares of capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, Parent were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. From the close of business on the Capitalization Date
to the date of this Agreement, there have been no issuances by Parent of

Capitalization Date, (B) upon the vesting and settlement of Parent RSUs

shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in,
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (ii) any warrants, calls, options or other
rights to acquire from Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any other
obligation of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or

rights referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence. Except as set forth above in this Section 3.03, there are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of Parent that have or by their terms
may have at any time the right to vote (which are convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
shareholders of Parent may vote (" _Parent Voting Debt_ "). Neither Parent nor
any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with respect
to the voting of any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, Parent. Except for this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of the
Parent Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement pursuant to which any Person
is entitled to elect, designate or nominate any director of Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries.

Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
subject, in the case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by
Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. The Parent Board has adopted

of Parent was present, (i) approving this Agreement, (ii) determining that
entering into this Agreement is in the best interests of Parent and its
shareholders and (iii) declaring this Agreement and the Merger advisable. Such

to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such

Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

Regulators and all other material regulatory permits, approvals, licenses and
other authorizations, including franchises, ordinances and other agreements
granting access to public rights of way, issued or granted to Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity that are required for Parent
and each of the Parent Subsidiaries to conduct its business, as presently
conducted (collectively, the " _Parent Licenses_ ").

  

  

  

 

25  

  


 

  

(b) Each Parent License is valid and in full force and effect and has not been
suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified. No Parent License is
subject to (i) any conditions or requirements that have not been imposed
generally upon licenses in the same service, unless such conditions or
requirements are set forth on the face of the applicable authorization or (ii)
any pending Action by or before the FCC or State Regulators to suspend, revoke
or cancel, or any judicial review of a decision by the FCC or State Regulators
with respect thereto. To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no (A) event,
condition or circumstance attributable specifically to Parent that would

extent that such Parent License is renewable by its terms), (B) pending or
threatened FCC or State Regulator regulatory Actions relating specifically to
one or more of the Parent Licenses or (C) event, condition or circumstance
attributable specifically to the Company that would materially impair, delay
or preclude the ability of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries to obtain any
Consents from any Governmental Entity. No Parent License, order or other
agreement, obtained from, issued by or concluded with any State Regulator
imposes or would impose restrictions on the ability of any Parent Subsidiary
to make payments, dividends or other distributions to Parent or any other
Parent Subsidiary that limits, or would reasonably be expected to limit, the
cash funding and management alternatives of Parent on a consolidated basis in
a manner disproportionate to restrictions applied by such State Regulators to
similarly situated companies.

  


 

  

(c) Parent, with respect to any Parent License and any activity regulated by
the FCC or State Regulators but not requiring a license (" _Unlicensed
Activity_ "), and each licensee of each Parent License and each Subsidiary
engaged in Unlicensed Activity (" _Unlicensed Subsidiary_ ") is, and since
December 31, 2013 has been, in compliance with each Parent License and has
fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect thereto and with
respect to any Unlicensed Activity required by the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Communications Act_ "), or the rules, regulations, written
policies and orders of the FCC (the " _FCC Rules_ ") or similar rules,
regulations, written policies and orders of State Regulators, and the payment
of all regulatory fees and contributions, except for exemptions, waivers or
similar concessions or allowances. The Parent and each licensee of each Parent
License and each of its Unlicensed Subsidiaries is in good standing with the
FCC and all other Governmental Entities, and neither Parent nor any such
licensee or any of its Unlicensed Subsidiaries is, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the respondent with respect to any formal complaint, investigation, audit,
inquiry, subpoena, forfeiture, or petition to suspend before the FCC, the
Universal Service Administrative Company (the " _USAC_ ") or any other
Governmental Entity (each, an " _Enforcement Proceeding_ "). The Parent or a
Parent Subsidiary owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity and controls

Subsidiaries.

is a party to any consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or
has been ordered since December 31, 2013, to pay any civil money penalty by,
the FCC, USAC or any other Governmental Entity (other than a taxing authority,
which is covered by Section 3.09), other than those of general application
that apply to similarly situated providers of the same services or their
Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, whether or not set forth in the
Parent Disclosure Letter, a " _Parent Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries been advised in writing since December 31,
2013 by any Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering or requesting any such Parent Regulatory Agreement.

SECTION 3.21. _Financing_. Parent has provided the Company a true and complete
copy, as of the date hereof, of an executed commitment letter (the " _Debt
Financing Commitment_ ") from the financial institutions identified therein
(the " _Commitment Parties_ "), to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for the
purpose of funding in part the Cash Consideration and replacing and
refinancing any credit facility or other Indebtedness of the Company, Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries that will not continue after the
Effective Time (the " _Debt Financing_ "). The Debt Financing Commitment is
valid, binding and, to the Knowledge of Parent, enforceable by Parent against
the other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of the date hereof, the Debt Financing
Commitment is in full force and effect and the respective obligations and
commitments therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach in any material respect or
default on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of the other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitment. Subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions contained in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 hereof and the
commencement and completion of the Marketing Period, as of the date hereof,
Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions in the Debt
Financing Commitment will not be satisfied, or that the Debt Financing will
not be made available on a timely basis in order to consummate the Merger. As
of the date hereof, no Commitment Party has notified Parent of its intention
to terminate any of the Debt Financing Commitment or not to provide the Debt
Financing. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 7.01
and 7.03 hereof and (ii) that the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with
its terms, the net proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with cash on
hand, will be sufficient to fund the Cash Consideration, the refinancing of
any credit facility or other Indebtedness of the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries that will not continue after the Effective Time,
the payment of any fees and expenses of or payable by Parent, and any other
amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with the consummation of
the Merger. Parent has paid in full any and all commitment or other fees
required by the Debt Financing Commitment that are due as of the date hereof,
and will pay, after the date hereof, all such fees as they become due. There
are no side letters or other Contracts (except for any customary fee letters
and/or engagement letters, true and complete copies of which have been
provided to the Company, with customary redactions (none of which redacted
terms would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the principal amount or
availability of the Debt Financing) relating to the Debt Financing to which
Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party other than as expressly set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment.

  


 

  

SECTION 3.22. _Merger Sub_. Parent is the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

SECTION 3.23. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article III, the Company
acknowledges that none of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any other Person
on behalf of Parent makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that the
Company has not relied on any such other representation or warranty.

SECTION 4.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of the Company's Subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Company Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and
possesses all Permits necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold
its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted
(the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have such power or
authority or to possess the Company Permits, individually or in the aggregate,

qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties and
assets makes such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions

Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent, prior to
execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the Amended and

SECTION 4.18. _Brokers ' Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than UBS Securities LLC (the "
_Company Financial Advisor_ "), the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
the Company, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of the Company. The Company has furnished to Parent true and complete
copies of all agreements between the Company and the Company Financial Advisor
relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
subject to redactions of the portions of such agreement relating to the
calculation of the fee payable to such Company Financial Advisor. The Company
has separately provided Parent with the result of a calculation of the
approximate amount of the fee that will be payable to the Company Financial
Advisor as a result of the Merger.

  

  

  

 

41  

  


 

  

SECTION 4.19. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the
opinion of the Company Financial Advisor dated the date of this Agreement, to
the effect that, as of such date and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations set
forth therein, the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration to be received
by the holders of Company Common Stock other than holders of Excluded Shares
and shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (a) the Company as treasury stock, (b) Parent or Merger Sub and (c)
any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or of Parent
(other than Merger Sub), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.20. _Communications Regulatory Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries hold all approvals,
authorizations, certificates and licenses issued by the FCC or State
Regulators and all other material regulatory permits, approvals, licenses and
other authorizations, including franchises, ordinances and other agreements
granting access to public rights of way, issued or granted to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity that are required for
the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries to conduct its business, as
presently conducted (collectively, the " _Company Licenses_ ").

  


 

  

(b) Each Company License is valid and in full force and effect and has not
been suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified. No Company License is
subject to (i) any conditions or requirements that have not been imposed
generally upon licenses in the same service, unless such conditions or
requirements are set forth on the face of the applicable authorization or (ii)
any pending Action by or before the FCC or State Regulators to suspend, revoke
or cancel, or any judicial review of a decision by the FCC or State Regulators
with respect thereto. To the Knowledge of the Company, there is no (A) event,
condition or circumstance attributable specifically to the Company that would
preclude any Company License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the
extent that such Company License is renewable by its terms), (B) pending or
threatened FCC or State Regulator regulatory Actions relating specifically to
one or more of the Company Licenses or (C) event, condition or circumstance
attributable specifically to the Company that would materially impair, delay
or preclude the ability of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to obtain
any Consents from any Governmental Entity. No Company License, order or other
agreement, obtained from, issued by or concluded with any State Regulator
imposes or would impose restrictions on the ability of any Company Subsidiary
to make payments, dividends or other distributions to the Company or any other
Company Subsidiary that limits, or would reasonably be expected to limit, the
cash funding and management alternatives of the Company on a consolidated
basis in a manner disproportionate to restrictions applied by such State
Regulators to similarly situated companies.

  


 

  

(c) The Company, with respect to any Company License and Unlicensed Activity,
and each of its Unlicensed Subsidiaries is, and since December 31, 2013, has
been, in compliance with each Company License and has fulfilled and performed
all of its obligations with respect thereto and with respect to any Unlicensed
Activity required by the Communications Act , or FCC Rules or similar rules,
regulations, written policies and orders of State Regulators, and the payment
of all regulatory fees and contributions, except for exemptions, waivers or
similar concessions or allowances. The Company and each licensee of each
Company License and each of its Unlicensed Subsidiary is in good standing with
the FCC and all other Governmental Entities, and neither the Company nor any
such licensee or any of its Unlicensed Subsidiaries is, to the Knowledge of
the Company, the respondent with respect to any Enforcement Proceeding. The
Company or a Company Subsidiary owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity
and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and decision-
making authority of each licensee of the Company Licenses and each of its
Unlicensed Subsidiaries.

  

  

  

 

42  

  


 

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any
currently effective cease-and-desist order or enforcement action issued by, or
is a party to any consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or
has been ordered since December 31, 2013, to pay any civil money penalty by,
the FCC, USAC or any other Governmental Entity (other than a taxing authority,
which is covered by Section 4.09), other than those of general application
that apply to similarly situated providers of the same services or their
Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, whether or not set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter, a " _Company Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries been advised in writing since
December 31, 2013 by any Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing,
initiating, ordering or requesting any such Company Regulatory Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.21. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge that none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any
other Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied on any such other
representation or warranty.

SECTION 5.02. Intentionally Omitted.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.03. _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.
(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their respective directors, officers or employees
or any of its or their respective investment bankers, accountants, attorneys
or other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Company Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way with any
Person (whether or not a Person making a Company Takeover Proposal) with
respect to, any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that
may reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished in connection therewith and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives an oral or written Company Takeover Proposal, which
Company Takeover Proposal did not result from any breach of this Section 5.03,
(i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person making the
Company Takeover Proposal or its Representatives to request that any Company
Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii) in response to a
written Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Company Proposal, the Company may (and may authorize and permit
its Affiliates and its and their Representatives to), subject to compliance
with Section 5.03(c), (A) furnish information (including non-public
information and data) with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
( _provided_ that all such information has previously been provided to Parent
or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it
is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
not less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other
than with respect to standstill provisions), and (B) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and such Person's Representatives). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.03(a) by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by the Company.

  

  

  

 

51  

  


 

  

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
or any such committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or
(B) adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt,
recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly
to adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement or arrangement (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to any Company Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company receives a Superior Company Proposal or
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change until after the third Business Day following Parent's
receipt of written notice (a " _Company Notice of Recommendation Change_ ")
from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such
action and specifying the reasons therefor, including in the case of a
Superior Company Proposal the terms and conditions of such Superior Company
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such
Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Recommendation
Change and a new notice period (which shall be two Business Days instead of
three Business Days)). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Company
Notice of Recommendation Change.

  

  

  

 

52  

  


 

  

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.03, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours of knowledge of receipt thereof by an officer or director of
the Company) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to
a Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such
Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry or proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry or proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent informed in
all material respects on a reasonably current basis of the status and details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover Proposal,
and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all correspondence and other written and electronic material
exchanged between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any
Person that describes any of the material terms or conditions of any Company
Takeover Proposal.

  


 

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
issuing a "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its
stockholders positions required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, in each case after the commencement of a tender offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), (ii)
issuing a statement in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal that does
not involve the commencement of a tender offer (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), so long as the statement includes
no more information than would be required for a "stop-look-and-listen
communication" under Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act if such
provision was applicable, or (iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (after
consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Company or the Company Board or any
committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by
Section 5.03(b).

  


 

  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) sale,
lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by
way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or
indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or
more of the total outstanding voting power of the Company, (iv) transaction in
which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly
or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right
to acquire beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the Company Common Stock or
(v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger).

  

  

  

 

53  

  


 

  

" _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer made by a
third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or, in a merger,
consolidation or statutory share-exchange involving such third party, the
stockholders of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the Company Common Stock or substantially all of
the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
(i) is on terms more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders
of Company Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal (including the legal, financial, regulatory,
timing and other aspects of the proposal and the identity of the Person making
the proposal) and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to
the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) is reasonably likely to be completed on
the terms proposed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal, and is fully financed or for which financing
(if required) is fully committed or, in the good faith determination of the
Company Board, is reasonably likely to be obtained.

relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and Parent shall prepare and
cause to be filed with the SEC the Form S‑4 registering a number of Parent
Common Shares equal to the number of Parent Common Shares to be issued as
Share Consideration and Mixed Share Consideration in the Merger, in which the
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and Parent and the Company
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form
S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish
all information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and
provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement, and the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement shall include all information
reasonably requested by such other party to be included therein. Each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or

with copies of all related correspondence between it and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent, as applicable, (i) shall
provide the other an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response (including the proposed final version of such document or response),
(ii) shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or
respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of
the Company and Parent shall advise the other, promptly after receipt of
notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of
any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Common Shares constituting the Share Consideration or Mixed Share
Consideration for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of the
Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have any
such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each
of the Company and Parent shall also take any other action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger and the issuance of
the Parent Common Shares constituting the Share Consideration and the Mixed
Share Consideration.

(b) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, which
Parent in good faith believes is required to be described in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company of such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, as required by Law, in disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement the Company's
stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(b) shall limit the obligations of
any party under Section 6.01(a).

  


 

  

(c) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4, which the Company in good faith believes is required to be
described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and,
as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to the Company's stockholders. Nothing in this Section
6.01(c) shall limit the obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the sole purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder
Approval. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act and to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 becomes effective and (ii) solicit the Company
Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend
to its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that
the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by Section 5.03(b). Except as expressly contemplated by the
foregoing sentence, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Company Takeover
Proposal or by the making of any Company Adverse Recommendation Change by the
Company Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted to
postpone convening or to adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (but not
beyond the End Date) if (x) such postponement or adjournment is required to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure in accordance with Section 6.01(c) and to
permit such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed
by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, (y)
such postponement or adjournment is in order to solicit additional proxies for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or (z) as of the
time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

SECTION 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law and any applicable Judgment, between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant

and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to each other
and to their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
Contracts and records of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
as applicable (other than any of the foregoing that relate to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement, or, except as expressly provided in Section
5.03 to any Company Takeover Proposal) and Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
the other party and such other party's Representatives such information
concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as such
other party may reasonably request; _provided_ that such requesting party and
its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the providing
party; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that neither Parent, the Company nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide such access
or information if such party determines, in its reasonable judgment, that
doing so is reasonably likely to (i) violate applicable Law or an applicable
Judgment or (ii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product protection or other legal privilege. In any such event,
Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible,
the applicable information in a way that would not violate applicable Law,
Judgment or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege or protection or risk
such liability, including entering into a joint defense agreement, common
interest agreement or other similar arrangement. All requests for information
made pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be directed to the executive officer
or other Person designated by the other party. Until the Effective Time, all
information provided will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement
dated as of March 27, 2017, by and among the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

by this Agreement.

Parent and the Company agree, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries, to cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
(i) obtain any FCC Consents, PSC Consents, and Local Consents, and to make any

promptly as practicable to any requests of the FCC, any State Regulator, or

Parent and the Company agree, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain any Consents of any Governmental Entity, and to make any

approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)), (x) the
strategy for obtaining any Consents from any Governmental Entity (including
the FCC Consents, PSC Consents and Local Consents) in connection with the

Burdensome Condition unless such Burdensome Condition is conditioned in all
respects upon the consummation of the Merger and will not be effective for any

the consent of Parent shall not affect any representation or warranty of the
Company under this Agreement or any condition under Section 7.01 or Section

administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following:

  


 

  

(i) adjust the terms of each Cash-Out RSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time to provide that, as of the Effective Time, each
such Cash-Out RSU shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall,
automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights
of such holder with respect thereto, (A) the Merger Consideration (which shall
be (1) the Share Consideration in respect of each Share Election RSU Share,
(2) the Mixed Consideration in respect of each Mixed Election RSU Share and
Non-Election RSU Share and (3) the Cash Consideration in respect of each Cash
Election RSU Share, based on such holder's election or Non-Election in
accordance with Section 2.04) for each share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Cash-Out RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) a cash
payment equal to any accrued dividend equivalents in respect of each such
Cash-Out RSU, provided that, (x) with respect to any Cash-Out RSU that is a
Company PSU, the number of shares of Company Common Stock deemed subject to
such Cash-Out RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be based upon
actual performance during the two years following the date of grant of the
applicable Cash-Out RSU (if such two-year period has concluded prior to the
Effective Time) or during the period beginning on the date of grant of the
applicable Cash-Out RSU and ending as of the Effective Time (if such two-year
period has not concluded prior to the Effective Time) as reasonably determined
by the Company Board in good faith (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
in consultation with Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
each such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of any fractional
Parent Common Shares that would result from the calculation in this Section
6.04(a)(i), a cash payment calculated in the manner set forth in Section
2.02(f);

  


 

  

(ii) adjust the terms of each Rollover RSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time to provide that, as of the Effective Time, each
such Rollover RSU shall, automatically and without any required action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into a time-based restricted stock
unit of Parent, with respect to a number of Parent Common Shares (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Rollover RSU by the RSU Exchange Ratio
(each, an " _Adjusted RSU_ "), subject to substantially the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Rollover RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that any performance-based vesting conditions or
requirements shall no longer apply) _provided_ that, with respect to any
Rollover RSU that is a Company PSU, the number of shares of Company Common
Stock deemed subject to such Rollover RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be based upon the target level of performance;

  

  

  

 

59  

  


 

  

(b) The holder of any Cash-Out RSU shall be entitled to make a Share Election,
Mixed Election or Cash Election with respect to each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Cash-Out RSU in accordance with Section 2.04 (and

each Non-Election RSU Share. Parent shall pay any cash amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 6.04 as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any

Company under the Company Stock Plans, each Adjusted RSU and the agreements
evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted RSUs appropriate notices
setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the respective Company Stock
Plans, and the agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted RSUs shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the

with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate
form) registering (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) a number of
Parent Common Shares equal to the number of Parent Common Shares subject to
the Adjusted RSUs pursuant to Section 6.04(a). Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to maintain (to the extent permitted under applicable Law) the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status
of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as any
Adjusted RSUs remain outstanding. The Company shall cooperate with, and assist

Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ")
as provided in their respective charters or bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar agreements
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, shall be assumed by Parent in the Merger,
without further action, as of the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for
a period of not less than six years following the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.05 contemporaneous with the closing of any such
consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance.

prepaid, non-cancellable, non-amendable and non-refundable "tail" directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their current and former directors, officers and employees
who are currently covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall provide such directors,
officers and employees with coverage for six years following the Effective
Time of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, except that in no event shall the Company pay with respect to
such "tail" policy more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by
the Company for such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2016
(the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this Section 6.05(c) for an amount that is equal to or
less than the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain as much comparable "tail"
insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for an amount
equal to the Maximum Amount. The "tail" policy obtained pursuant to this
Section 6.05(c) shall not be amended, modified, cancelled or revoked by the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified Person), his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and

together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as

in the Debt Financing Commitment that are applicable to Parent and within its
control, including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees
required as a condition to the Debt Financing and (v) if all conditions to the

notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any Commitment Party under the
Debt Financing Documents or any termination of any of the Debt Financing
Documents. Other than as set forth in this Section 6.16, Parent shall not,

waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Debt
Financing Documents or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt
Financing Documents (other than in accordance with the "market flex"
provisions), in each case to the extent such amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver (i) would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
(A) adversely affecting the ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) delaying the
Closing or (ii) contains conditions and other terms that would reasonably be
expected to affect the availability of the Debt Financing that are more
onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof; _provided_ that
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall be
entitled from time to time to (x) amend, restate, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Debt Financing
Commitment or substitute other financing for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing from the same or alternative financing sources, and (y) amend,
restate, replace, supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Financing Commitment
for the purpose of adding agents, co-agents, lenders, arrangers, bookrunners
or other persons that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of
the date hereof, in each case, subject to subclauses (i) and (ii) above. Upon
any such amendment, supplement or modification, in accordance with the terms
of this Section 6.16(a), the term " _Debt Financing Commitment_ " shall mean
for all purposes of this Agreement the Debt Financing Commitment as so
amended, supplemented or modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of any such amendment, supplement or
modification (subject, in the case of any fee letter or engagement letter, to

Financing)).

Debt Financing that is available and cash on hand and other readily available
liquidity, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Parent in cash in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby ("
_Alternative Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) obtain a new financing commitment
letter (the " _Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and a new definitive
agreement with respect thereto that provides for financing (A) on terms not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (taking into account
the "market flex" provisions of the existing Debt Financing Commitment), (B)
containing conditions and other terms that would reasonably be expected to
affect the availability thereof that (1) are not more onerous, taken as a
whole, than those conditions and terms contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment as of the date hereof and (2) would not reasonably be expected to
delay the Closing and (C) in an amount that is sufficient, when added to any
portion of the Debt Financing that is available and cash on hand and other
readily available liquidity, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
Parent in cash in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In such event, the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing, and
the term " _Debt Financing Commitment_ " as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include any Alternative Debt Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto agree that the Company shall cooperate with Parent
to obtain any Alternative Debt Financing in the manner set forth in Section

otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this

79  

  


 

  

SECTION 9.08. _Governing Law_. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable
conflict of Laws principles (except that the matters relating to the fiduciary
duties of the Parent Board shall be subject to the internal Laws of the State
of Ohio); _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, all matters relating
to the Debt Financing shall be exclusively governed and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule whether of the State of New York
or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York and each of the parties hereto
agrees that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 9.11 shall be
applicable to any such matter.

  


 

  

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over any Action, the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if
subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the Action
is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America,
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof (such courts, the " _Selected Courts_ "). The
parties hereto hereby irrevocably (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the Selected Courts in any such Action, (ii) waive the defense of an
inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such
Action brought in the Selected Courts, (iii) agree to not contest the
jurisdiction of the Selected Courts in any such Action, by motion or otherwise
and (iv) agree to not bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby in any
court other than the Selected Courts, except for Actions brought to enforce
the judgment of any such court. The consents to jurisdiction and venue set
forth in this Section 9.08(b) shall not constitute general consents to service
of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that
service of process upon such party in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by Federal Express, UPS,
DHL or similar courier service to the address set forth in Section 9.02 of
this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such
Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights
to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial
court judgment.

  

  

  

 

80  

  


 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto agrees that it will not bring, or permit any of its Affiliates
to bring, any suit, action or other proceeding of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Commitment Party or any Financing Source arising out of or
relating to (x) the Debt Financing or (y) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within Borough of Manhattan in the City of New
York, New York, whether a state or federal court, and each of the parties
hereto agrees that the waiver of jury trial set forth in Section 9.11 shall be
applicable to any such suit, action or other proceeding.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto, except that Parent may assign, in
its sole discretion, all of the rights, interests and obligations of Parent
under this Agreement to (i) any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or (ii)
pursuant to a collateral assignment of all of its rights hereunder to any of
its financing sources, but, in each case, no such assignment shall relieve
Parent of its obligations under this Agreement. No assignment by any party
shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this Section 9.09 shall be null and void.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.10. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the following sentence, the
parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 9.08(b) without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is
an integral part of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and without that right neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of
specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid or contrary to Law, and not to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or
that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.10 shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

  

  

  

 

81

RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.12. _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company (i) agrees on its behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates that none of the Commitment Parties nor the Financing
Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company and their
respective Affiliates relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing), (ii) waives any
rights or claims against any Commitment Party or any Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement (including any of the transactions contemplated
hereby) and the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise and (iii) agrees not to, and shall not, (A) seek to enforce this
Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement, or seek to
recover monetary damages (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any special,
consequential, punitive, indirect, speculative or exemplary damages or damages
of a tortious nature) from, any Commitment Party or any Financing Source or
(B) seek to enforce the commitment in respect of any Debt Financing against,
make any claims for breach of commitments in respect of any Debt Financing
against, or seek to recover monetary damages (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any special, consequential, punitive, indirect, speculative or
exemplary damages or damages of a tortious nature) from, or otherwise sue, any
Commitment Party or any Financing Source for any reason in connection with
commitments in respect of any Debt Financing or the obligations of the
Commitment Parties and the Financing Sources thereunder, this Agreement, or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Debt Financing.
