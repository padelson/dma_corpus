THE OFFER; THE MERGER; CONVERSION OF SHARES 

  

 Section 2.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.1 and none of the events or conditions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of _Annex I_  shall have occurred and be continuing and not have been waived by Parent or Merger Sub, as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement. The date on which Merger Sub commences the Offer, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Commencement Date_ ". Each share of Company Common Stock accepted by Merger Sub in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer shall be purchased for cash at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for (and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for) any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered on or prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with this Agreement) and not properly withdrawn shall be subject to (i) there being validly tendered (other than by guaranteed delivery where actual delivery has not occurred on or prior to such time) and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with this Agreement) that number of shares of Company Common Stock which, when added to any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, represents a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the " _Minimum Condition_ "), and (ii) the other events or conditions set forth in _Annex I_. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), in accordance with the terms of the Offer, consummate the Offer and accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock (the time of such first acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after expiration of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if on the initial expiration date of the Offer or on any subsequent scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with this Agreement), any of the events or conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex I_  shall exist and, 

     ##### 

  

    

subject to the provisions of this Agreement, shall not have been waived by
Merger Sub, Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to (and, in such case,
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to), from time to time, extend the Offer for
additional successive periods of up to twenty (20) Business Days per
extension (with the length of such periods to be determined by Parent), until
all of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ are satisfied or validly waived
in order to permit the Acceptance Time to occur, and (ii) Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer from time to time for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff of the SEC
applicable to the Offer. If less than 90% of the number of outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offer,
Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion (and without the consent of the
Company or any other Person), elect to provide for one or more subsequent
offering periods (of up to twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate)
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right from time to time to waive any of the conditions set forth
in _Annex I_ (other than the Minimum Condition and the condition set forth in
subparagraph (e) of _Annex I_ ) or to increase the Offer Price or to make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_  that,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not
decrease the Offer Price, change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be
purchased in the Offer, change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, impose
additional conditions to the Offer or modify or change any condition to the
Offer in a manner materially adverse to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock or in a manner which would delay consummation of the Offer,
reduce the time period during which the Offer shall remain open or, except
for any extension required or permitted hereunder, extend or otherwise change
the expiration date of the Offer, or amend, modify or supplement any other
term of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock or in a manner which would delay consummation of the Offer. 

   

 (b) Subject to the first sentence of _Section 2.1(a)_, as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, no later than the Offer Commencement Date, in order to reflect the execution of this Agreement and the terms hereof, Parent shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which will contain a form of a letter of transmittal (such schedule together with the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer is made, and any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ").

Documents promptly after Parents or Merger Subs, as the case may be,
receipt of such comments, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the response of Parent or Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments
on that response. 

   

 (c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any shares of Company Common Stock previously tendered and Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof. 

   

 (d) If any portion of the Offer Price is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the tendered shares of Company Common Stock are registered, the amount of any stock transfer or other similar Taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s), or such other Person, or otherwise) payable on account of such transfer to such other Person shall be deducted from the Offer Price for the exchange of such shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, unless evidence satisfactory to Merger Sub of the payment of such Taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted. 

   

 (e) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to the Offer.

The Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company has been advised that all of its directors and executive officers who own shares of Company Common Stock intend to tender such shares pursuant to the Offer. 

   

 (b) On the same date that the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC as contemplated by the first sentence of _Section 2.1(b)_, the Company shall, in a manner that

sentence of this _Section 2.3(a)_ the " _Company Directors_ "); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company shall, subject to the

the Company, the new directors designated by Parent for election to the Board
of Directors of the Company pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ will be deemed to
be "continuing directors" for purposes of Section 11 of the Certificate of

Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates and who are reasonably satisfactory to

immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be entitled to designate three
(3) persons to the Board of Directors of the Company who are not
officers, directors, employees or designees of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Affiliates and who are reasonably satisfactory to Parent (and, in each

purposes of this Agreement). The Board of Directors of the Company
shall, subject to the Companys Constituent Documents and applicable Law,
take all actions necessary to appoint the individuals designated in the
preceding sentence to the Board of Directors of the Company. Upon Parents
request, at each such time Parent is entitled to designate directors on
the Board of Directors of the Company, the Company will also cause (i) each
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, (ii) the Board of
Directors of each of the Subsidiaries, and (iii) each committee of such Board
of Directors of each of the Subsidiaries to include persons designated
by Parent constituting at least the same percentage of each such committee or
Board of Directors as Parents designees constitute on the Board of Directors
of the Company. The Companys obligations to cause the election or
appointment of Parents designees to the Board of Directors of the Company
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder in

include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company
and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) of the

Company on a timely basis the information and consents with respect to Parent
and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. Parent will be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
officers and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 thereunder.

    #####

Company Common Stock as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, of a sufficient
number of directors to implement the provisions of  _Section 2.3(a)_. The
Company shall deliver to Parent true and complete copies of such resignations
prior to the Acceptance Time. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to  _Section 9.8_, following the time directors designated by Parent are elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Company Directors then in office shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies hereunder, (iii) agree to extend the time for performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder, or (iv) take any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Board of Directors of the Company adversely affecting the rights of the Companys stockholders (other than Parent or Merger Sub).

 (b) The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once in whole and not in part at any time within ten (10) Business Days following the payment by Merger Sub for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer representing at least such number of shares of Company Common Stock as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, or if any subsequent offering period is provided, during the ten (10) Business Day period following the expiration date of the subsequent offering period;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, and (ii) the Effective Time.

shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and, based on the information
specified in the notice of Parent or Merger Sub, the number of Top-Up Shares.
At the Top-Up Closing, (i) Parent or Merger Sub shall pay to the Company the
aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares either entirely in
cash or, at Parents or Merger Subs election, by (x) paying in cash an
amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares
and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having
a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price to be
paid for the Top-Up Shares less the amount paid in cash (the " _Promissory
Note_ "), and (ii) the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a
certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The Promissory Note shall be
unsecured, full recourse, non-negotiable and non-transferable, be due on the
first anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, bear simple interest of three
percent (3%) per annum, be prepayable without premium or penalty, and shall
have no other material terms. 

   

 (d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that each of Parent and Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Parent or Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). 

   

 Section 2.5 _Short Form Merger_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, after the consummation of the Offer and any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably practicable as provided in Section 253 of the DGCL, and otherwise as provided in this  _ARTICLE II_. 

  

 Section 2.6 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware (as such, the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, in accordance with the DGCL, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts and obligations of Merger Sub shall become the debts and obligations of the Surviving Corporation.

The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with and accepted for record by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time (not to exceed thirty (30) days after such acceptance) as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. As used herein, the " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at which the Merger shall become effective.

 Section 2.11 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding (including all Company Restricted Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent, or dissenting shares as set forth in _Section 2.13_) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

     ##### 

  

    

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, none of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ shall remain outstanding and such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the extent applicable, as a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Securities, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this  _Section 2.11_. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (d) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of Company Series A Preferred Stock of the Surviving Corporation unaffected by the Merger other than, from and after the Effective Time and pursuant to the terms of Section 6.2(i) of the Certificate of Designations of the Company Series A Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration that would have been receivable upon the Merger by a holder of the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such share of Company Series A Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 2.12 _Treatment of Company Restricted Shares_. The Board of Directors of the Company (or the relevant committee thereof responsible for administration of the Company Stock Plans) has adopted or shall adopt prior to the Acceptance Time resolutions, and the Company has taken or shall take prior to the Acceptance Time all actions (including obtaining consent from any applicable holder), to the extent necessary to ensure that, as of the Acceptance Time, each Company Restricted Share which is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable, and all restrictions thereon shall lapse immediately prior to the Acceptance Time. 

  

 Section 2.13 _Appraisal Rights_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any share of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock that, as of the Effective Time, is held by a holder who is entitled to, and who has properly preserved, appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such share shall not, in the case of the Company 

      ##### 

  

    

Common Stock, be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.11_ or, in the case of the
Company Series A Preferred Stock, be deemed to remain outstanding as a share
of Company Series A Preferred Stock, and the holder of such share shall
be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such share; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such appraisal rights shall not be perfected or the holder of such
share shall otherwise waive or lose such holders appraisal rights with
respect to such share, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
time of the failure to perfect such rights or the loss of such rights, such
share shall, in the case of the Company Common Stock, automatically be
converted into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the
surrender of the stock Certificate representing such share) the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.11_ and, in the case of the
Company Series A Preferred Stock, automatically resume the status of an
outstanding share of Company Series A Preferred Stock. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of (A) any written demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (B) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer. For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that, in any appraisal proceeding with respect to dissenting shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series A Preferred Stock and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the dissenting shares shall be determined in accordance with Section 262(h) of the DGCL without regard to the Top-Up Option, the shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option or any promissory note delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company in payment for the shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option. 

   

 Section 2.14 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.11_, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_ , in trust for each holder of shares of Company Common Stock. All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_." The 

    ##### 

  

    

Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.11_ out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Exchange Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent so long
as such investment is in securities fully guaranteed by the United States of
America which may be liquidated at any time without loss or penalty. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
property of, and paid to, Parent. 

   

 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check drawn by the Exchange Agent or a bank cashiers check in the amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE II_. The Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any required stock transfer or other similar Taxes or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _ARTICLE II_. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.14_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts 

     ##### 

  

    

would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_. 

   

 Section 2.15 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity or Taxing Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 2.16 _Certain Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Securities of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section 2.16_ shall be construed to require or permit the Company or Parent to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.17 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such Takeover Proposal.

  

 (c) At any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may (i) effect a Change in Company Recommendation; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) in response to a Superior Proposal that was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this Agreement, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and concurrently with such termination, upon payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be entitled to exercise its right to effect a Change in Company Recommendation or its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant hereto unless (A) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to (x) effect a Change in Company Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change in Company Recommendation_ ") which notice shall contain a description of the events, facts and circumstances giving rise to such proposed action or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.5(c)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") which notice shall contain a description of the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including a copy of any such written Superior Proposal), and (B) Parent does not make, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such Notice of Change in Company Recommendation or

    ##### 

  

     

Notice of Superior Proposal, as the case may be (it being understood and
agreed that, with respect to a Notice of Superior Proposal, any material
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new three
(3) Business Day period), a proposal that would, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor), cause such events, facts and
circumstances to no longer form the basis for the Board of Directors of
the Company to effect a Change in Company Recommendation, in the case of a
Notice of Change in Company Recommendation, or be at least as favorable to
the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal, in the case of a
Notice of Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that, during the three (3)
Business Day period after Parents receipt of a Notice of Change in Company
Recommendation or Notice of Superior Proposal, as the case may be, the
Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and
its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent.

 (b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Acceptance Time, such Continuing Employees shall receive full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit level with respect to vacation entitlement, severance programs and other paid time off for service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the same extent that such service was recognized as of the Acceptance Time under a comparable plan of the Company or Company Subsidiary in which the Continuing Employee participated, in each case without duplication of benefits.

  

 (c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by the Company or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates in which Continuing Employees are eligible

    ##### 

  

     

to participate after the Acceptance Time, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Affiliates shall (i) waive all limitations

corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which he or she participated
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee and his or her eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Acceptance Time under the
corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which he or she participated
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time in satisfying the out-of-pocket or
deductible requirements applicable under any such plan, in each case without
duplication of benefits. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.6_ are included for the sole benefit of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement, (ii) shall limit the right of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement following the Acceptance Time or (iii) shall create any third party beneficiary or other right (x) in any other Person, including any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or (y) to continued employment with Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

" _Change in Control Arrangement_ " shall mean each employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit

    ##### 

  

     

plan, contract or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to which any holder of Company Common Stock could become entitled to
(A) any additional compensation, enhanced severance or other benefits or any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation, severance
or other benefits or any funding of any compensation or benefits by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as a result of the
Offer, the obtaining of the Company Stockholder Approval or the consummation
of the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or
in combination with any other event), or (B) any other compensation
or benefits from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related to or
contingent upon or the value of which would be calculated on the basis of the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event). 

  

 (f) Immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall cause the Superior Well Services, Ltd. 401(k) Retirement Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated. The Company shall take all steps necessary to fully vest all accounts under the Company 401(k) Plan as of the termination date.

Alternatively, Parent (or the Company with the consent of Parent in its sole discretion) may purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy containing terms and conditions which are, individually and in the aggregate, at least as protective and no less advantageous to the insured than the D and O Insurance maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall any policy require payment of aggregate premiums for such insurance in excess of the aggregate Maximum Annual Premium for such six-year period.

The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the word "include", "includes" or "including" is used in this Agreement, it shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereby", "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer to the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The words describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa and words denoting any gender shall include all genders. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received counterparts thereof signed and delivered by the other Parties hereto. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. 

 

 (a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Annex hereto) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

 (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person not a Party to this Agreement any rights, benefits or remedies of any

    ##### 

  

     

nature whatsoever, other than _Section 6.8_ (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
Persons). 

   

 Section 9.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_  that Parent and Merger Sub may assign their rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent so long as Parent continues to remain primarily liable for all of such rights and obligations and so long as such assignment would not require additional approvals of the Companys stockholders. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 2.3(c)_, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, to the extent such approval is required by applicable Law, but, after such approval, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. 

  

 Section 9.9 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to _Section 2.3(c)_, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. 

  

 Section 9.10 _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. 

 

 (a) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court within the State of

    ##### 

  

     

Delaware, the Delaware Court of Chancery and any such other court, the "
_Delaware Courts_ ") in respect of all matters arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this Agreement, and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree
not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties hereto irrevocably agree
that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and
determined exclusively in such courts. The Parties hereby consent to and
grant the Delaware Courts jurisdiction over the person of such Parties solely
for such purpose and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 9.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof. 

  

 (b) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS RULES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.

  

 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10(C)_.

   

 Section 9.11 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction without proof of damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right for specific enforcement shall include the 

   ##### 

  

  

right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Offer, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.
If, prior to the Walk-Away Date, any Party brings any action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
Party, the Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of
time during which such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or
(y) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
action.

 _ANNEX I_  

   

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER 

   

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Merger Subs rights and obligations to extend and amend the Offer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Subs obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any validly tendered shares of Company Common Stock if (i) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, (ii) any waiting period (including any extensions thereof) applicable to the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated, or (iii) at any time after the date of this Agreement and before the Acceptance Time, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing: 

 

 (a) any Law shall have been adopted or promulgated, or any temporary, preliminary or permanent Order shall have been issued and remain in effect by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction having the effect of making the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

 (b) (i) the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.3_ (other than the last sentence of _Section 3.3(c))_, _Section 3.4_ and _Section 3.5_ shall not be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Acceptance Time as though made at the Acceptance Time (other than representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of another date, which shall not be true and correct as of such date), or (ii) all other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _ARTICLE III_ of this Agreement, in each case, made as if none of such representations and warranties contained any qualifications or limitations as to "materiality" or Material Adverse Effect, shall not be true and correct, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Acceptance Time as though made on and as of the Acceptance Time (other than representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of another date, which shall not be true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct as so made, individually or in the aggregate, does not have or would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company;

  

 (c) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

  

 (d) there has been any change, development, event, occurrence or effect that has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; or

  

 (e) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

    ##### 

  

     

 Immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a certificate executed on behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the Company certifying that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) in this _Annex I_ are satisfied as of such time and date. 

  

 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and may be asserted by Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time. The failure by Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ shall have the meanings set forth in the agreement to which it is annexed, except that the term "Agreement" shall be deemed to refer to the agreement to which this _Annex I_ is annexed.
