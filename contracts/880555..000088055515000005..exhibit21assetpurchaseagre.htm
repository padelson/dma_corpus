EMPLOYEES



6.1 Continued Association With the Business. On or prior to the date of the
Closing

Buyer expects to offer employment on an at will basis to certain Seller
Employees who are involved in the digital business with the expectation that
such employment would commence on the Closing Date (the "Closing Date
Employees") . On or prior to the date of the Combination, Buyer will offer
employment on an at-will basis to certain other Seller Employees that it
selects in its sole discretion; provided that Buyer intends to extend such
offers to at least forty (40) full- time Seller Employees, including the
Closing Date Employees. Seller agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to encourage such Seller Employees to accept employment with Buyer. Each offer
shall be for a position that is substantially comparable (including with
respect to compensation and benefits) to the position the Seller Employee held
with Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each Seller Employee who
accepts Buyer's offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer shall
be referred to as a "Transferred Employee" for purposes of this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall prevent Buyer from terminating the employment of any such
Transferred Employee at any time and for any reason after the date that is 90
days following the date of the Combination. All employment offers made to the
Seller Employees by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.1 are subject to the
applicable Seller Employee's completion and submission to Buyer of (i) Buyer's
standard agreements related to confidentiality, nonsolicitation,
noncompetition, and protection of intellectual property, (ii) Buyer's
employment application, including successful completion of Buyer's standard
background check, (iii) Form I-9, and (iv) any other documents required to be
submitted by similarly situated employees of Buyer as a pre-condition to
employment with Buyer.



6.2 Severance. Concurrently with the Combination, Seller shall terminate the
employment of all Transferred Employees, and shall pay to each such employee
any amounts (if any) due and owing through the applicable termination date
with respect to earned but unused vacation, personal time, sick time, and
other paid time off, any accrued salary, bonuses, wages, commissions,
severance, change in control or other special bonus payments, in each case
only to the extent that such amounts are due and payable pursuant to a Seller
Plan or applicable Law (it being understood that any accrued but not yet
payable amounts shall be paid after the applicable termination date subject to
the terms of the Seller Plans). For the avoidance of doubt, no Transferred
Employee will be entitled to severance or other termination-related payments
or benefits in connection with any termination of employment by Seller in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. Seller shall be
responsible for any notice obligations incurred under the WARN Act solely as a
result of its actions up to and including the date of the Combination. Buyer
does not assume any liability and Seller expressly assumes all liabilities for
any claim for severance made by any Seller Employee whose employment
terminates (or who gives or receives notice to terminate their employment)
prior to the date of the Combination. Except as set forth in Schedule
2.5(b)(1), Seller does not assume any liability and Buyer expressly assumes
all liabilities for any claim for severance made by any Transferred Employee
who terminates employment after the date of the Combination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer for any severance
obligation owed or paid by any Buyer Plan (as defined below) to a Transferred
Employee (i) whose pending visa application is not approved after the
Combination or (ii) whose H1-B visa cannot be transferred to Buyer.



6.3 No Assumption of Employee Liabilities. Except to the extent expressly
provided herein: (i) all responsibilities, commitments, and/or liabilities for
or relating to the employment of any Seller Employee who becomes a Transferred
Employee incurred or arising out of such employment or engagement prior to the
Closing Date or date of the Combination, as applicable, and (ii) all
responsibilities, commitments, and/or liabilities for or relating to the
employment of any Seller Employee or service provider who does not become a
Transferred Employee shall be retained by Seller and shall constitute Excluded
Liabilities.



6.4 Seller Plans. Seller will retain responsibility for, by insurance or
otherwise, all Seller Plan liabilities, expenses and benefits. Seller shall
ensure that all Seller Employees receive matching, profit sharing, and other retirement contributions, and credit for retirement
benefit accrual purposes, required to be made under all Seller Plans providing
retirement or pension benefits to the Seller Employees, for services performed
for the period beginning on the first day of the applicable plan year that
includes the Closing Date, or respective date of hire for such Transferred
Employees, as applicable, and ending on such date, if such Transferred
Employees are otherwise eligible for such contributions or accruals. Prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall cause all Seller Plans providing retirement or
pension benefits to the Transferred Employees to be amended to the extent
necessary to provide full vesting for the accrued benefits or accounts of
Transferred Employees.



6.5 Buyer Plans. Effective as of the Combination, the Buyer shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, make all Transferred Employees eligible to
participate in the Employee Plans maintained by Buyer ("Buyer Plans"), subject
to terms and conditions of each such plan. The Buyer shall recognize the
service of each Transferred Employee with Seller before the date of the
Combination for purposes of determining eligibility under the Buyer Plans.
Buyer shall be

responsible for all benefit claims covered by Buyer Plans and incurred by such
Transferred Employees (and their eligible dependents) following their
enrollment in Buyer Plans in accordance with the terms thereof. No assets of
any Seller Plan shall be transferred to Buyer or to any Buyer Plan. However,
Buyer shall cause its 401(k) plan to accept rollovers of the accounts of any
Transferred Employee upon distribution from Seller's 401(k) plan.



6.6 COBRA Obligations. On and after the Closing Date or the date of the
Combination, as applicable, Buyer shall provide, and Seller agrees to
reimburse Buyer for any expenditures paid from the Buyer Plans (to the extent
that such expenditures were incurred by Buyer as a result of Seller's actions
prior to the Closing Date or the date of the Combination, as applicable)
related to, continuation coverage under section 4980B of the Code and sections
601-

608 of ERISA to any "MandA qualified beneficiary" as such term is defined in
Treas. Reg. §

54.4980B-9, QandA-4 who is covered under any group health plan maintained by
Buyer after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller agrees to
reimburse Buyer for any expenditures related to Seller Employees who are not
offered employment with the Buyer or to Seller Employees who do not accept
employment with the Buyer.



6.7 Continuation of FICA/FUTA. Seller shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate for Buyer to be designated a successor employer to Seller with
respect to the Transferred Employees for employment Tax purposes (including
for purposes of Federal Insurance Contributions (FICA) and Federal
Unemployment Tax (FUTA)). Accordingly, Seller shall assist Buyer in being
treated as a successor employer to Seller for such purposes, including by
providing Buyer (or Buyer's designated Affiliate) with appropriate wage and
payroll data for this purpose for the period commencing on the first day of
the year that includes the Closing Date and ending on the date of hire with
Buyer with respect to each Transferred Employee.



6.8 Worker's Compensation . Seller shall be responsible for all workers'
compensation benefits, occupational diseases claims and employer liability
claims payable to Seller Employees with respect to (a) claims filed by any
Transferred Employee prior to the Closing or Combination, as applicable; (b)
claims filed by any Transferred Employee after the Closing or Combination, as
applicable, resulting from a discrete event or injury occurring prior to the
Closing or Combination, as applicable; and (c) claims filed by employees other than
Transferred Employees regardless of when the claims were filed or the injury
incurred. Buyer shall be responsible for the administration and payment of all
other workers' compensation liabilities and benefits with respect to
Transferred Employees from their date of hire by Buyer.



6.9 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement expressed or
implied is intended to confer upon any employee of Seller or Buyer or his or
her legal representatives any rights as a third party beneficiary or otherwise
or any remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any rights of employment, continued
employment, compensation or benefits or any nature or kind whatsoever. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit plan, program or arrangement.



6.10 Documents and Forms. Seller and Buyer agree to use reasonable efforts to
execute all necessary documents, file all required forms with any Governmental
Body and take

all other actions that may be necessary or appropriate to implement
expeditiously the actions contemplated by this Article VI.

(b) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance

(including reasonable access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, and the

Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate with each other in the conduct of any
audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Business, the

8.17 Reserved.



8.18 Restrictive Covenants.



(a) Non-Competition. Seller agrees, from the time of the Combination until the
expiration of the Restricted Period that it will not, directly or indirectly,
in any manner (whether on his or its own account, or as an owner, operator,
manager, investor, agent or otherwise), (i) engage directly or indirectly in
the Business as it is conducted as of the Closing

Date, or (ii) engage directly or indirectly in any business that is
competitive with the Business as it is conducted as of the Closing Date, (each
a "Competitive Activity"), or own any interest in, manage, control,
participate in (whether as an owner, operator, manager, investor, agent,
representative or otherwise), or consult with or render services for any
Person that is engaged in any Competitive Activity; provided, however, that
(i) the ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding stock of any publicly
traded corporation shall not be deemed to be engaging in a Competitive
Activity solely by reason of such ownership and (ii) actions by Seller in
accordance with the terms of the items listed in Schedule 1.3 shall not be
deemed to be engaging in a Competitive Activity. For the avoidance of doubt,
the publishing and promoting of Muscle and Fitness Hers in print and digital
form is not a Competitive Activity.



(b) Non-Solicitation. Seller agrees, from the time of the Combination until
the expiration of the Restricted Period, not to directly or indirectly
solicit, induce or encourage any executive or employee or other personnel
(including contractors) of the Business as of the Closing Date or the
Shape/Fitness Business as of the date of the Combination, to leave, alter or
cease his or its relationship with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, for any
reason whatsoever; provided, however, that Seller may solicit, hire or assist
or participate in the solicitation or hiring of (i) any such personnel via
form letter, blanket mailing or published advertisement or (ii) any former
executive or employee or other personnel (including contractors) of the
Business or the Shape/Fitness Business whose employment or engagement was
involuntarily terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or who has not been
employed or engaged by Buyer or its Affiliates for the six (6)-month period
prior to such hiring.

 (c) Enforcement. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of Section 8.18(a) or Section 8.168(b) is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision
with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closer
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed. The existence of any claim
or cause of action by Seller against Buyer or any of its Affiliates, whether
predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to
the enforcement by the Buyer of the provisions of Section 8.18(a) or Section
8.18(b), which Section will be enforceable notwithstanding the existence of
any breach by Buyer.

ARTICLE XI



SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

 11.1 Indemnification by the Seller. Seller, shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents (the
"Buyer Indemnitees") against and in respect of all of their Losses arising
from or relating to: (a) any breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by Seller in this Agreement, including the Schedules or any
other exhibit or schedule to this Agreement, (b) any breach of the covenants
and agreements made by Seller in this Agreement, including the Schedules or
any other exhibit or schedule to this Agreement, or any Ancillary Agreement,
(c) any Excluded Liability and (d) any Excluded Asset; provided that Buyer
makes a written claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.4 below
within the applicable survival period pursuant to Section 11.3 below).



11.2 Indemnification by the Buyer. The Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents (the
"Seller Indemnitees") against and in respect of Losses of Seller Indemnitees
arising from or relating to: (a) any breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by the Buyer in this Agreement, including the Schedules or any
other exhibit or schedule to this Agreement, (b) any breach of the covenants
and agreements made by the Buyer in this Agreement, including the Schedules or

and (c) any Assumed Liability; provided that Seller makes a written claim for
indemnification against the Buyer pursuant to Section 11.4 below within the
applicable survival period pursuant to Section 11.3 below).



11.3 Survival of Claims; Limitations of Indemnity.



(a) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall have
a survival period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date; provided,
however, (i) that the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1
(Authority), 4.2 (Validity), 4.3 (Due

Organization), 4.8 (Title to Assets), 4.22(a) (Brokers and Change of Control
Payments) and 5.1 (Representations and Warranties of Buyer) shall survive
indefinitely, and (ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.14 (Tax Matters), Section 4.16 (Environmental Matters) and Section 4.21
(Employee Benefits) shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations
plus sixty (60) days (collectively, the items referred to in Section

Representations"), and (iii) all covenants contained in this Agreement shall
survive until fully performed or discharged.



(b) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from
and against any Losses, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or

respect to the Excluded Representations and fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) until such Buyer Indemnitees shall have suffered Losses by
reason of all such breaches in excess of an aggregate of $1 million (the
"Basket"), after which point Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees for
all Losses exceeding $1 million. Except with respect to the Excluded
Representations and fraud or intentional misrepresentation, neither Seller, on
the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand, will have aggregate liability to
the other for a breach of a representation or warranty in excess of $8 million
(the "Indemnification Cap"). With respect to the Excluded Representations and
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, neither Seller, on the one hand, nor
Buyer, on the other hand, will have aggregate liability to the other for a
breach of a representation or warranty in excess of the aggregate
consideration actually paid by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. 

(c) For purposes of determining whether there has been any misrepresentation

purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom, all
qualifications or exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or
referring to the terms "material", "materiality", "in all material respects",
"Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded,
it being the understanding of the parties that for purposes of determining
liability under this Article XI, the representations and warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if such terms and phrases
were not included in them. The representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation, verification or
examination by any party hereto or by anyone on behalf of any such party.



11.4 Procedure for Third Party Indemnification Claims.



(a) If any third party shall notify any Party (the "Indemnified Party") with
respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which, if true (without any
responsibility for independent investigation of the facts or law contained in
such notice from the third party), would give rise to a claim for
indemnification against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this
Article XI, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying
Party in writing; provided, however, (i) that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to
the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.



(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume, at the Indemnifying
Party's sole cost and expense, the defense of the Third Party Claim with
counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, if (i)
such Indemnifying Party notifies the

Indemnified Party in writing within ten (10) business days after the
Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third Party Claim that it will
indemnify the Indemnified Party against any Losses arising out of such Third
Party Claim and that it intends to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides reasonable evidence to the
Indemnified Party of its financial ability to satisfy its indemnification
obligations, and (iii) the suit, action claim, liability, or obligation does
not seek to impose any liability, obligation or restriction upon the
Indemnified Party other than for money damages; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard; and
provided further that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain
separate co-counsel and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party
shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless, (x) the employment
thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing,
(y) there exists a conflict between the interests of the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party that reasonably requires the retention of separate
counsel, or (z) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and
employ counsel.



(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed and is actively and
diligently conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with
Section 11.4(b) above, (i) the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (not to be delayed or withheld unreasonably) and (ii) the
Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be delayed or withheld
unreasonably).



(d) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.4(b) above,
however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third
Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnifying Party will remain
responsible for any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party
Claim to the fullest extent provided, but subject in all respects to the
various limitations and undertakings set out in this Article XI.



(e) Amounts payable by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in
respect of any Losses for which any Party is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, including the costs of defending against a Third Party Claim, shall
be payable by the Indemnifying Party as incurred by the Indemnified Party.



11.5 Payment of Claims. If either party becomes obligated to indemnify another
party with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder and the amount
of liability with respect thereto shall have been finally determined, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay such amount to the Indemnified Party in
immediately available funds within ten (10) days following written demand by
the Indemnified Party. The amount of any indemnification payments shall be net
of any insurance proceeds reasonably expected to be realized by the
indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such amount
payable or any correlative adjustments resulting from such indemnification
payment. All indemnification payments under this Agreement shall be

treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes unless
required otherwise by

Law.



11.6 Other Indemnification Provisions.



(a) Following the Closing Date, none of the parties or any of the directors,
officers, managers, partners, employees, equityholders, agents or
representatives of the parties or their Affiliates as of immediately prior to
the Closing shall have any liability of any kind to the other party, subject
only to the Indemnified Parties' ability to bring indemnification claims
pursuant to this Article XI which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Indemnified Parties for breach of any representations and warranties or
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement; provided, that the
foregoing shall not (i) interfere with or impede the operation of the
provisions of Article II (including Schedule 2.5(b)) with respect to the
resolution of certain disputes relating to the Purchase Price among the
parties or (ii) limit the rights of the parties to seek equitable remedies
(including specific performance or injunctive relief) or to seek recovery with
respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none
of the parties hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this
Agreement for any punitive, special, or exemplary damages, or any other damages based on a financial
"multiple" that may have been used in determining the Purchase Price, or for
damages based on the loss of business reputation or opportunity, except those
paid to a third party. Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable steps
to mitigate their respective Losses and expenses upon and after becoming aware
of any event or condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Losses and expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder.



11.7 Setoff. Either party shall be entitled to recover any indemnification
payments due hereunder by setting off such amount against any amount due from
the other party, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise,
including any amounts owed to Seller pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof provided,
in all cases and in aggregate for either party, no party shall be entitled to
offset any amounts in excess of $8 million in the aggregate.

 EXHIBIT F



TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT



This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into this day
of January, 2015 by and between Meredith Corporation, a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of Iowa ("Buyer") and American Media, Inc., a
corporation organized under the laws of the state of Delaware ("Provider").







RECITALS



WHEREAS, Provider and Buyer are parties to that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated January 26th, 2015 (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to
which Provider is selling and assigning to Buyer, and Buyer is purchasing and
assuming from Provider, the Purchased Assets (as such term is defined in the
Purchase Agreement) of the Business (as such term is defined in the Purchase
Agreement), all as more fully described therein;



WHEREAS, in order to ensure an orderly transition of the Business to Buyer and
as a condition to consummating the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement, Buyer and Provider have agreed to enter into this Agreement,
pursuant to which Provider will provide, or cause its affiliates to provide,
Buyer with certain services, in each case on a transitional basis and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein; and



WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants
hereinafter set forth, Buyer and Provider hereby agree as follows:





ARTICLE I



SERVICES



Section 1.01 Provision of Services.



(a) Provider agrees to provide, or to cause its affiliates to provide, the
services (the "Services") set forth on the exhibits attached hereto (as such
exhibits may be amended or supplemented pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, collectively, the "Service Exhibits") to Buyer for the respective
periods and on the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in the respective Service Exhibits.



(b) Notwithstanding the contents of the Service Exhibits, Provider agrees to
consider in good faith any reasonable request by Buyer for access to any
additional services that are necessary for the operation of the Business and
which are not currently contemplated in the Service Exhibits. If Provider
agrees to provide any such additional

services, such services shall be at a price to be agreed upon after good faith
negotiation between the parties and such services so provided by Provider
shall constitute Services under this Agreement and be subject in all respect to the provisions of this Agreement as
if fully set forth on a Service Exhibit as of the date hereof.



(c) The parties hereto acknowledge the transitional nature of the Services.
Accordingly, as promptly as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make a
transition of each Service to its own internal organization or to obtain
alternate third-party sources to provide the Services.



(d) Subject to Section 2.03, Section 2.04 and Section 4.05, the obligations of
Provider under this Agreement to provide Services shall terminate with respect
to each Service on the end date specified in the applicable Service Exhibit
(the "End Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and
agree that Buyer may determine from time to time that it does not require all
the Services set out on one or more of the Service Exhibits or that it does
not require such Services for the entire period up to the applicable End Date.
Accordingly, Buyer may terminate any Service, in whole and in part, upon
thirty (30) days' prior written notification to Provider of any such
determination.





Section 1.02 Standard of Service.



(a) Provider represents, warrants and agrees that the Services shall be
provided in good faith, in accordance with Law and, except as specifically
provided in the Service Exhibits and this Section 1.02, in a manner generally
consistent with the historical conduct of the Services and with the same
standard of care as historically utilized. Subject to Section 1.03, Provider
agrees to (a) assign sufficient resources and qualified personnel as are
reasonably required to perform the Services and (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any applicable third-party providers to provide or
to permit Provider to provide Services to Buyer in accordance with the
standards set forth in the preceding sentence.



(b) Except as expressly set forth in Section 1.02(a), Provider makes no
representations and warranties of any kind, implied or expressed, with respect
to the Services, including, without limitation, no warranties of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, which are specifically
disclaimed. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not create
a fiduciary relationship, partnership, joint venture or relationships of trust
or agency between the parties and that all Services are provided by Provider
as an independent contractor.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Service
Exhibits, neither Provider nor its Affiliates shall be obligated to provide,
or cause to be provided, any Service (or portion thereof) to the extent
performance of such Service (or portion thereof) would require Provider or any
of its Affiliates to violate or breach (a) any applicable Law, (b) any
contract with a third party or (c) changes to such Person's written policies
and procedures generally applicable to its other businesses or customers which
are made after the Closing Date and which are necessary to (x) comply with
applicable Law or (y) reasonably respond to a reasonably plausible security
threat; provided, that for

the avoidance of doubt, the Provider shall continue to be obligated to
provide, or cause to be provided, any such Services (or portions thereof) to
the extent that doing so would not result in any such violation or breach.



 Section 1.03 Third-Party Service Providers. Provider shall have the right to
hire third-party subcontractors to provide all or part of any Service
hereunder. Provider shall in all cases retain responsibility for the provision
to Buyer of Services to be performed by any third-party service provider or
subcontractor or by any of Provider\'s affiliates.





ARTICLE II



COMPENSATION



Section 2.01 Responsibility for Wages and Fees. Except as contemplated in the
Purchase Agreement, for such time as any employees of Provider or any of its
Affiliates are providing the Services to Buyer under this Agreement, (a) such
employees will remain employees of Provider or such Affiliate, as applicable,
and shall not be deemed to be employees of Buyer for any purpose, and (b)
Provider or such Affiliate, as applicable, shall be solely responsible for the
payment and provision of all wages, bonuses and commissions, employee
benefits, including severance and worker\'s compensation, and the withholding
and payment of applicable Taxes relating to such employment.





Section 2.02 Terms of Payment and Related Matters.



(a) As consideration for provision of the Services, Buyer shall (i) pay
Provider the amount specified for each Service on such Service\'s respective
Service Exhibit, provided however, that there shall be no fees for Services
for the period from the date of this Agreement until March 1, 2015 and (ii) up
to the date of the Combination, allow Provider reasonable access to the
Purchased Assets and Transferred Employees in order for Provider to publish
the issues of the Brands that predate the Buyer Issues.



(b) As more fully provided in the Service Exhibits and subject to the terms
and conditions therein:



(i) Provider shall provide Buyer with monthly invoices ("Invoices"), which
shall set forth in reasonable detail, with such supporting documentation as
Buyer, amounts payable under this Agreement; and



(ii) payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within thirty (30) days
after the date of receipt of an Invoice by Buyer from Provider.





Section 2.03 Extension of Services. The parties agree that Provider shall not
be obligated to perform any Service after the applicable End Date; provided,
however, that if Buyer desires and Provider agrees to continue to perform any
of the Services after the applicable End Date, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to determine an amount that reasonably compensates Provider. The
Services so performed by Provider after the

applicable End Date shall continue to constitute Services under this Agreement
and be subject in all respects to the provisions of this Agreement for the
duration of the agreed- upon extension period.

 Section 2.04 Terminated Services. Upon termination or expiration of any or all
Services pursuant to this Agreement, or upon the termination of this Agreement
in its entirety, Provider shall have no further obligation to provide the
applicable terminated Services and Buyer will have no obligation to pay any
future compensation relating to such Services (other than for or in respect of
Services already provided in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
received by Buyer prior to such termination).





Section 2.05 Invoice Disputes. In the event of an Invoice dispute, Buyer shall
deliver a written statement to Provider no later than five (5) days prior to
the date payment is due on the disputed Invoice listing all disputed items and
providing a reasonably detailed description of each disputed item. Amounts not
so disputed shall be deemed accepted and shall be paid, notwithstanding
disputes on other items, within the period set forth in Section 2.02(b). The
parties shall seek to resolve all such disputes expeditiously and in good
faith. Provider shall continue performing the Services in accordance with this
Agreement pending resolution of any dispute.





ARTICLE III



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



Section 3.01 License. Buyer grants Provider and its affiliates, sub-
contractors and Representatives a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide,
fully paid-up and royalty-free license under all Intellectual Property Rights
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) owned or licensable by Buyer and its
affiliates, but solely for the purposes of (a) performing the Services and (b)
publishing, distributing, marketing and selling issues of the Brands that
predate the Buyer Issues.





Section 3.02 Provided Content. Buyer represents and warrants to Provider that
the content and materials (with the exception of the content and materials
included in the Purchased Assets) uploaded to the applicable website or
provided or made available by Buyer in connection with this Agreement or the
Services does not, and its use in the performance of the Services will not,
(i) infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any intellectual property,
publicity or privacy right of another, (ii) defame, slander or disparage any
person or entity, or (iii) violate applicable law or regulation. Provider may
suspend any Service or Services upon written notice to Buyer if it reasonably
believes Buyer has violated or is in violation of the foregoing.

 ARTICLE IV



TERMINATION



Section 4.01 Termination of Agreement. Subject to Section 4.04, this Agreement
shall terminate in its entirety (i) on the date upon which Provider shall have
no continuing obligation to perform any Services as a result of each of their
expiration or termination in accordance with Section 1.01(d) or Section 4.02,
(ii) thirty (30) days after notice from Buyer to Provider of Buyer's election,
in its sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement, or (iii) in accordance
with Section 4.03.





Section 4.02 Breach. A party may terminate this Agreement with respect to any
Service, in whole but not in part, at any time upon prior written notice to
the other party (the "Breaching Party") if the Breaching Party has failed
(other than pursuant to Section

4.05) to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement relating
to such Service, and such failure shall have continued without cure for a
period of fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written
notice of such failure from the Non- Breaching party seeking to terminate such
service. For the avoidance of doubt, non- payment by Buyer for a Service
provided by Provider in accordance with this Agreement and not the subject of
a good-faith dispute shall be deemed a breach for purposes of this Section
4.02.





Section 4.03 Insolvency. In the event that either party hereto shall (i) file
a petition in bankruptcy, (ii) become or be declared insolvent, or become the
subject of any proceedings (not dismissed within sixty (60) days) related to
its liquidation, insolvency or the appointment of a receiver, (iii) make an
assignment on behalf of all or substantially all of its creditors, or (iv)
take any corporate action for its winding up or dissolution, then the other
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written
notice in accordance with Section 7.04 below.





Section 4.04 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement in its
entirety pursuant to Section 4.01, all obligations of the parties hereto shall
terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.02 (in respect of Services
provided through the date of termination), Section 2.04, Section 3.02, Article
V, Article VI and Article VII, which shall survive any termination or
expiration of this Agreement.





Section 4.05 Force Majeure. The obligations of Provider under this Agreement
with respect to any Service shall be suspended during the period and to the
extent that Provider is prevented from providing such Service, or Buyer is
prevented from receiving such Service, due to any of the following causes
beyond such party\'s reasonable control (such causes, "Force Majeure Events"):
(i) acts of God, (ii) flood, fire or explosion, (iii) war, invasion,
terrorism, riot or other civil unrest, (iv) Governmental Order or Law, (v)
actions, embargoes or blockades in effect on or after the date of this
Agreement, (vi) action by any Governmental Authority, (vii) national or
regional emergency, (viii) strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, (ix) shortage of adequate power,
transportation facilities or telecommunications or the partial or complete

failure of the foregoing, or (x) any other event which is beyond the
reasonable control of such party. The party suffering a Force Majeure Event
shall give notice of suspension as soon as reasonably practicable to the other
party stating the date and extent of such suspension and the cause thereof,
and Provider shall resume the performance of its obligations as soon as
reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause. Neither Buyer nor
Provider shall be liable for the nonperformance or delay in performance of its
respective obligations under this Agreement when such failure is due to a
Force Majeure Event. The applicable End Date for any Service so suspended
shall be automatically extended for a period of time equal to the time lost by
reason of the suspension.





ARTICLE V



CONFIDENTIALITY



Section 5.01 Confidentiality.



(a) During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three years
thereafter, the parties hereto shall, and shall instruct their respective
Representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose the other party\'s
financial, technical, sales, marketing, development, personnel, and other
information, records, or data, including, without limitation, customer lists,
supplier lists, trade secrets, designs, product formulations, product
specifications or any other proprietary or confidential information, however
recorded or preserved, whether written or oral, including all Proprietary
Information (any such information, "Confidential Information"). Each party
hereto shall use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, to
protect the other party\'s Confidential Information as it uses to protect its
own Confidential Information of like nature. Unless otherwise authorized in
any other agreement between the parties, any party receiving any Confidential
Information of the other party (the "Receiving Party") may use Confidential
Information only for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement (the "Permitted Purpose"). Any Receiving Party may disclose such
Confidential Information only to its representatives who have a need to know
such information for the Permitted Purpose and who have been advised of the
terms of this Section 5.01 and the Receiving Party shall be liable for any
breach of these confidentiality provisions by such persons; provided, however,
that any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to the
extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by a
governmental order, in which case the Receiving Party shall promptly notify,
to the extent possible, the disclosing party (the "Disclosing Party"), and
take reasonable steps at the Disclosing Party's expense to assist in
contesting such governmental order or in protecting the Disclosing Party\'s
rights prior to disclosure, and in which case the Receiving Party shall only
disclose such Confidential Information that it is advised by its counsel in
writing that it is legally bound to disclose under such governmental order.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" shall not
include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (i) was
publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known through no
act of the Receiving Party or its Representatives in breach of this Section
5.01; (ii) to its knowledge



was rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality;
or (iii) was developed by it independently without any reliance on the
Confidential Information.



(c) Upon demand by the Disclosing Party upon expiration or termination of this
Agreement with respect to any Service, the Receiving Party agrees promptly to
return or destroy, at the Receiving Party\'s option, all Confidential
Information relevant solely to the provision or receipt of that Service and no
longer needed regarding the performance of other Services under this Agreement
or otherwise required to be retained by Provider pursuant to applicable Law.
If such Confidential Information is destroyed, an authorized officer of the
Receiving Party shall certify to such destruction in writing. If any
Confidential Information is retained to comply with applicable Law, such
information will be used for that and no other purpose.





ARTICLE VI

this Agreement by Provider or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Provider or its Affiliates or any third party that provides a Service to Buyer
pursuant to Section 1.03 in connection with the provision of, or failure to
provide, any Services to Buyer, except to the extent those Losses are due to
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
and (ii) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Provider and its
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Provider Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses of the Provider
Indemnified Parties relating to, arising out of or resulting from breach of
this Agreement by Buyer or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer

negligence or willful misconduct of the Provider Indemnified Parties.
