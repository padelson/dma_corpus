The Merger 

__2.01 _The Merger._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, United shall take any and all action
necessary (i) to cause Merger Sub to become a party to this Agreement, to be
evidenced by the execution by the Merger Sub of a supplement to this Agreement
in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ and delivery thereof to Georgetown;
and (ii) to cause Merger Sub to take all actions necessary or proper to
comply with the obligations of United and such Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, including the
Plan of Merger, at the Effective Time, Georgetown shall merge with and into
Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of Georgetown
shall cease and Merger Sub shall survive and continue to exist as a Virginia
corporation (Merger Sub, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes
being referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). United may at
any time prior to the Effective Time change the method of effecting the
combination with Georgetown (including, without limitation, the provisions of
this Article II) if and to the extent it deems such change to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable; provided, that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the
tax-free treatment of the Merger to Georgetowns stockholders as a result of
receiving the Merger Consideration, or (iii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and provided,
further, that United shall provide Georgetown prior written notice of such
change and the reasons therefor.

 

(c) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, the Merger shall become effective upon such date and time as may
be set forth in the articles of merger filed with (i) the VSCC in accordance
with Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA, and (ii) the DC Department in accordance
with Section 29-309.06 of the DC Business Code. The Merger shall have the
effects prescribed in the VSCA and the DC Business Code.

 



8 (d) The Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable law.

 

2.02 _Effective Date and Effective Time._

 

(a) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, the parties shall cause the effective date of the Merger (the "
_Effective Date_ ") to occur on either (i) the fifth business day to occur
after the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
closing of the Merger (or, at the election of United, on the last business day
of the month in which such period expires), or (ii) such other date to which
the parties may agree in writing. The time on the Effective Date when the
Merger shall become effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if
United shall exercise its right to delay the Effective Date pursuant to
Section 2.02(a)(i), and a record date for any dividend or other distribution
in respect of the United Common Stock is taken during the period of such delay
such that Georgetown stockholders will not be entitled to participate in such
dividend, each stockholder of Georgetown shall be entitled to receive, upon
surrender of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
other provisions of Article III, a payment equal to the amount and kind of
dividend or other distribution that such holder would have received had such
holder been a holder of record of the shares of United Common Stock issuable
to such holder in the Merger on the record date for such dividend or other
distribution.

 

2.03 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

ARTICLE III

 

Consideration; Exchange Procedures

 

3.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any Person:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each holder of a share of Georgetown Common Stock
(other than United and its Subsidiaries and Georgetown, in each case except
for shares held by them in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted and except for Dissenting Shares) shall receive
in respect thereof, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement,
0.9313 shares (" _Exchange Ratio"_ ) of United Common Stock (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 



9 (b) _Outstanding United Stock_. Each share of United Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.

(c) _Merger Sub Shares_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
and unaffected by the Merger, and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.

 

3.02 _Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers._ At the Effective Time, holders
of Georgetown Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of Georgetown, other than to receive the Merger Consideration (if
so provided in Section 3.01(a)) and any dividend or other distribution with
respect to such Georgetown Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to
the Effective Time, the payment, if any, in lieu of certain dividends on
United Common Stock provided for in Section 2.02(b), and the consideration
provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Georgetown or the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Georgetown Common Stock.

3.03  _Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of United Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefore, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger; instead, United shall pay to each holder of Georgetown Common Stock
who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of United Common Stock
(after taking into account all Old Certificates registered in the name of such
holder or Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) an amount in cash (without
interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by the average of the daily
closing prices for the shares of United Common Stock for the 20 consecutive
full trading days on which such shares are actually traded on the NASDAQ (as
reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, any other
authoritative source) ending at the close of trading on the tenth trading day
(the " _Determination Date_ ") immediately preceding the Effective Date) (the
" _Average Closing Price_ ").

3.04 _Exchange Procedures._

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, United shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
certificates formerly representing shares of Georgetown Common Stock (" _Old
Certificates_ ") and holders of non-certificated shares of Georgetown Common
Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article
III, (i) certificates representing shares of United Common Stock or non-
certificated shares of United Common Stock (collectively, " _New Certificates_
") and (ii) an amount of cash necessary for payments required by Section 3.03
(the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund will be distributed in accordance
with the Exchange Agents normal and customary procedures established in
connection with merger transactions. 

 



10 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later
than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of one or more Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for New Certificates, if any,
that the holders of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled to
receive pursuant to Article III, any cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which the shares of Georgetown Common Stock represented by the
Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
this Agreement and any payment required pursuant to Section 2.02(b) of this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
United Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Article III, if any, (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III, and (iii) any payment required by Section
2.02(b), and the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.

(c) Neither the Exchange Agent, if any, nor any party hereto shall be liable
to any former holder of Georgetown Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to United Common Stock
with a record date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing
shares of Georgetown Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to
receive shares of such United Common Stock until the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive New Certificates in exchange therefore in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 3.04. After becoming so entitled in
accordance with this Section 3.04, the record holder thereof also shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions by the Exchange
Agent, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of United Common Stock such holder had the right to receive
upon surrender of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Georgetown on the business day after the one-year anniversary
of the Effective Date shall be paid to United. Any stockholders of Georgetown
who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to United for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on United Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Georgetown Common Stock such
stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon.

 



11 3.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event United changes (or establishes
a record date for changing) the number of shares of United Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization
or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding United Common Stock
and the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, or shall
establish a record date prior to the Effective Date with respect to any
dividend or other distribution in respect of the United Common Stock other
than a cash dividend consistent with past practice, the Exchange Ratio shall
be proportionately adjusted to provide the holders of Georgetown Common Stock
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event.

3.06 _Options._ At the Effective Time, the holders of each outstanding option
(each, a " _Georgetown Stock Option_ ") to purchase shares of Georgetown
Common Stock, whether vested or unvested as of the date of this Agreement,
under any and all plans of Georgetown under which stock options (collectively,
the " _Georgetown Stock Plans_ ") shall vest pursuant to the terms thereof
and shall be converted into an option (each, a " _Replacement Option_ ") to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Georgetown Stock Option, the number of shares of United Common Stock equal to
(a) the number of shares of Georgetown Common Stock subject to the Georgetown
Stock Option multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio. Such product shall be
rounded to the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share (rounded up
to the next whole cent) of each Replacement Option shall equal (y) the
exercise price per share of shares of Georgetown Common Stock that were
purchasable pursuant to such Georgetown Stock Option divided by (z) the
Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Georgetown Stock Option
that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section
424 of the Code and all other options shall be adjusted in a manner that
maintains the options exemption from Section 409A of the Code. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Georgetown shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any necessary consents from optionees with respect to the Georgetown
Stock Plans to permit replacement of the outstanding Georgetown Stock Options
by United pursuant to this Section 3.06 and to permit United to assume
the Georgetown Stock Plans. Georgetown shall further take all action
necessary to amend the Georgetown Stock Plans to eliminate automatic grants or
awards thereunder following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, United
shall assume the Georgetown Stock Plans; provided that such assumption shall
only be with respect to the Replacement Options and shall have no obligation
to make any additional grants or awards under the Georgetown Stock Plans other
than those grants or awards that have been made or accrued prior to the
Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective Time, United shall file a
post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or an effective registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares
of United Common Stock subject to such Replacement Options, shall distribute a
prospectus relating to such Form S-8, if applicable, and shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as such Replacement Options remain outstanding.

3.07 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

 __(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Georgetown Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such Dissenting Shares (the "
_Dissenting Stockholders_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 29311 of the Business Code (" _Section_

 



12 _ 29-311_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive any of the consideration as specified in this Article III (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such stockholder shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 29311\. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each stockholder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 29311\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such stockholder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 29311, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 29311, then the right of such stockholder to be paid the fair value
of such stockholders Dissenting Shares under Section 29311 shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 3.01. __

 

(b) Georgetown shall give United prompt written notice (but in any event
within 48 hours) of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Georgetown
Common Stock and any withdrawals of such demands, and United shall have the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Georgetown shall not, except with the prior written
consent of United, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle,
or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.

3.08  _Withholding Rights_. United or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts, if any, as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority by or on behalf of United or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, such amounts withheld will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by United or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be.

5.01 _Disclosure Schedules._ On or prior to the date hereof, United has
delivered to Georgetown a schedule and Georgetown has delivered to United a
schedule (respectively, its " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") setting forth, among
other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either
in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision
hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained
in Article IV; _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth
in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if
its absence would not be reasonably likely to result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the
standard set forth in Section 5.02, and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in
a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall
not be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the party making the
representation. All of Georgetowns and Uniteds representations, warranties
and covenants contained in this Agreement are qualified by reference to its
respective Disclosure Schedule and none thereof shall be deemed to be untrue
or breached as a result of effects arising solely from actions taken in
compliance with a written request of the other party. To the extent any
representation, warranty or covenant applies to 901 Southern Avenue, LLC, a
Maryland limited liability company, the reference to Georgetown in the
Agreement will be deemed to include such subsidiary.

 

5.02 _Standard._ No representation or warranty of Georgetown or United
contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no
party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as
a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
warranty contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge"
shall mean (i) with respect to United, actual knowledge of Richard M. Adams,
Richard M. Adams, Jr., James J. Consagra, Jr., Craig L. Smith, W. Mark
Tatterson, Douglas Ernest and Darren Williams, and (ii) with respect to
Georgetown, actual knowledge of Michael P. Fitzgerald, Timothy Veith, Domingo
Rodriguez, Jeff Hedderly and Kent Carstater.

5.01 and 5.02 and except as Previously Disclosed, Georgetown hereby
represents and warrants to United that:

(a) _Organization and Standing_. Georgetown is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the District of

(b) _Capitalization_. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of
Georgetown consists of (i) 30,000,000 shares of Georgetown Common Stock, of
which as of the date hereof, 6,668,293 shares are outstanding, and

properties and assets; and Georgetown has the corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject
to receipt of required approvals by the stockholders of Georgetown, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) _Corporate Authority_. Subject to receipt of the requisite approval of
this Agreement (including the Merger and Plan of Merger) by the holders of at
least a majority of the voting interest in the outstanding voting stock
entitled to be cast at the Georgetown Meeting (which is the only vote of
Georgetown stockholders required thereon), the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby have been authorized by all
necessary corporate action of Georgetown and the Georgetown Board. Assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by United, this Agreement is a
valid and legally binding obligation of Georgetown, enforceable in accordance
with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights or by general equity principles).

(ii) Subject to receipt of the approvals or consents referred to in Section
5.03(f)(i), and expiration of related waiting periods, the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (A) constitute a breach or
violation of, or a default under, or give rise to any Lien, any acceleration

any judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or license, or any agreement,
indenture or instrument of Georgetown or to which Georgetown is subject or
bound, (B) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, the

Consultants_ ") or current or former director (the " _United Directors_ ")
of United or any of its Subsidiaries participates or to which any United
Employees, United Consultants or United Directors are a party (the " _United

regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and
notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,

401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter (including a
determination that the related trust under such United Compensation and
Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the IRS
or the Compensation

 



34  and Benefit Plan uses a prototype or volume submitter plan that is the
subject of an IRS opinion or advisory letter, and United is not aware of any
circumstances which could adversely affect such qualification or which are
likely to result in the revocation of any existing favorable determination
letter or in not receiving a favorable determination letter. There is no
material pending or, to the knowledge of United, threatened legal
action, suit or claim relating to the United Compensation and Benefit Plans

expected to subject United or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty

for purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such
transaction expired as of the date hereof.

(iii) No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC which have
been made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by United or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (a " _United ERISA
Affiliate_ ") which is considered one employer with United under Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (a " _United ERISA
Affiliate Plan_ "). None of United, any of its Subsidiaries or any United
ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA at any time since
September 26, 1980. No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived, has been required to be filed for any United Compensation and Benefit
Plan or by any United ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending
on the date hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Pension Plan or United ERISA Affiliate
Plan and, to Uniteds knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material
risk that such proceedings will be instituted. To the knowledge of United,
there is no pending investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL
or IRS or any other governmental agency with respect to any United
Compensation and Benefit Plan. Under each United Pension Plan and United
ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the most recent actuarial valuation
performed prior to the date of this Agreement, the actuarially determined
present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
contained in such actuarial valuation of such United Pension Plan or United
ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of
such United Pension Plan or United ERISA Affiliate Plan and since such date
there has been neither an adverse change in the financial condition of such
United Pension Plan or United ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other
change to such Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase the
amount of benefits thereunder which reasonably could be expected to change
such result.

 

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any United
Compensation and Benefit Plan or United ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which United
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party have been timely made or have been
reflected on Uniteds financial statements. Neither any United Pension Plan
nor any United ERISA Affiliate Plan has an

 



35  "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and all required payments
to the PBGC with respect to each United Pension Plan or United ERISA
Affiliate Plan have been made on or before their due dates. None of United,
any of its Subsidiaries or any United ERISA Affiliate (x) has provided, or
would reasonably be expected to be required to provide, security to any
United Pension Plan or to any United ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any
action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in the
imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA.

(v) Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to provide
retiree health and life insurance, retiree long-term care insurance, retiree
death or other benefits, other than a program to offer to remit premiums and
provide some administrative tasks with respect to retiree health and live
insurance paid by retirees under any United Compensation and Benefit Plan,
other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code, and each such
United Compensation and Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without
incurring liability thereunder and there has been no communication to
Employees by United or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to promise or guarantee such Employees retiree health or life
insurance or other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis.

(vi) United and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any United Compensation and
Benefit Plans covering foreign Employees.

(vii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result
of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time)
reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any United Employee, United Consultant
or United Director to any payment (including severance pay or similar
compensation) or any increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or
acceleration of any benefits under any United Compensation and Benefit Plan or
(C) result in any material increase in benefits payable under any United
Compensation and Benefit Plan.

(viii) Except for compensation paid to Richard M. Adams, neither United nor
any of its Subsidiaries maintains any compensation plans, programs or
arrangements the payments under which would not reasonably be expected to be
deductible as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and
the regulations issued thereunder.

(ix) As a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination
of employment prior to or following the Effective Time), neither United nor
Georgetown, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be obligated to make
a payment that would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" to an
individual who is a "disqualified individual" (as such terms are defined in
Section 280G of the Code), without regard to whether such payment is
reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in
the future.

 



36 (x) Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any agreement, taken
any action, or omitted to take any action, with respect to or as part of any
United Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an operational failure under
Section 409A of the Code or that would reasonably be expected to subject
United or any of its Subsidiaries to any obligation to report any amount or
withhold any amount as includable in income and subject to tax, interest or
any penalty by any service provider to United or any of its Subsidiaries under
Section 409A of the Code or to pay any reimbursement or other payment to any
service provider, as defined under Section 409A of the Code, respecting any
such tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(m) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by United that would give rise to
any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finders
fee or other like payment with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, excluding a Previously Disclosed fee to Sandler ONeill and
Partners, L.P.

 

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither United nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to

it or any such Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the
meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel United or
any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or
conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute
involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to Uniteds knowledge,
threatened, nor is United aware of any activity involving its or any of its
Subsidiaries employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or
engaging in other organizational activity. United and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance and at all times have complied in all respects with all applicable
laws governing the employment of labor and the withholding of taxes, including

operation of United or its Subsidiaries nor any condition of any property
presently or previously owned, leased or operated by any of them (including,
without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of
them holds a Lien, violates or violated Environmental Laws and to
Uniteds knowledge no condition has existed or event has occurred with
respect to any of them or any such property that, with notice or the passage

Environmental Laws. To Uniteds knowledge, neither United nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice from any person or entity that United or

withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation, if the Georgetown Board,

statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders
and at the time of the Georgetown Meeting, as the case may be, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or any statement which, in the light of the circumstances under

or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof
and to take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of United Stock for offering or sale in

United or its Subsidiaries nor Georgetown shall be required to provide access

the attorney-client privilege of United, Georgetown or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or contravene any applicable law or
regulation or binding contract, agreement or arrangement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement; and in any such event, the parties will
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

(b) Each of Georgetown and United shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to this Section 6.05 in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of that certain
confidentiality agreement dated August 12, 2015 between Georgetown and United
and that certain confidentiality agreement dated October 31, 2015 between
Georgetown and United (collectively, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ ").

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each party shall promptly furnish the other with copies of all monthly and
other interim financial statements produced in the ordinary course of business
as the same shall become available.

6.06  _Acquisition Proposals._ Georgetown agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to, solicit
or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential

 



41  information to, or have any discussions with any person relating to, any
Acquisition Proposal. It shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of
this Agreement with any parties other than United with respect to any of the
foregoing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. Georgetown will inform United promptly of all relevant details of
any inquiries or contacts by third parties relating to the possible
disposition of the business or the capital stock of Georgetown or any merger,
change or control or other business combination involving Georgetown.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time the Georgetown Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law, Georgetown, in response to a written Acquisition
Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this Agreement or that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.06, may furnish non-
public information with respect to Georgetown to the Person who made such
Acquisition Proposal and participate in negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

 

6.07 _Takeover Laws._ No party hereto shall take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any applicable Takeover Law,
as now or hereafter in effect.

6.08 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)._ United and Georgetown
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain certain
directors and officers of Georgetown in connection with the Merger, both prior
to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the directors
and officers of Georgetown not be subject to a risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and for that compensatory and retentive
purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 6.08. The United Board, or a
committee of "Non-Employee Directors" (as such term is defined for purposes
of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall promptly, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause any dispositions of Georgetown Common Stock, Georgetown
Stock Options or acquisitions (and any subsequent dispositions) of United
Common Stock or Replacement Options by the directors and officers of
Georgetown, who, immediately following the Merger, will be directors and
officers of United subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

6.09 _Regulatory Applications. _

(a) United and Georgetown and their respective Subsidiaries and affiliates, as
applicable, (a) shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) covenant and agree that
none of the information supplied or to be supplied by such party and any of
its Subsidiaries and affiliates, as

 



42  applicable, for inclusion in any filings with Governmental Authorities will,
at the respective time such filing is made be false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made not misleading. Each party shall use its reasonable efforts to resolve
objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to the Merger under
any applicable law, regulation or decree, including agreeing to divest any
assets, deposits, lines of business or branches; _provided_ , that United
shall not be required to agree to any condition or take any action if
such agreements or the taking of such action is reasonably likely to result
in a condition or restriction having an effect of the type referred to in
Section 7.01(b). Each of United and Georgetown shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other,
in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to
any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable, in any event, United shall make all necessary filings and
notices within 90 days of the date of this Agreement. Each party hereto
agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the
obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will
keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the
other party upon receiving any communication from a Governmental Authority the
consent or approval of which is required for the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Regulatory
Communication_ "). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication, without
limiting the scope of the foregoing paragraphs, United shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law (i) promptly advise Georgetown of the receipt of
any substantive communication from a Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide Georgetown with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of any response
thereto and the preparation of any other substantive submission or
communication to any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to review any such response, submission or
communication prior to the filing or submission thereof, and (iii) promptly
provide Georgetown with a report with respect to any meetings or substantive
telephone conversations that United or its Subsidiaries or their respective
representatives may have from time to time with any Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or
on behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party
or Governmental Authority.

6.10 _Indemnification. _

(a) Following the Effective Date and for a period of six years thereafter,
United shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present directors,
officers and employees of Georgetown (each, an " _Indemnified Party"_ )
against all costs or expenses (including reasonable

 



43  attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs"_ ) incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time to the fullest extent that Georgetown is permitted or required to
indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors and officers under the laws
of the District of Columbia, the Georgetown Certificate, the Georgetown
Bylaws and any agreement as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers,
directors or employees conduct complies with the standards set forth under
District of Columbia law, the Georgetown Certificate, the Georgetown Bylaws
and any agreement shall be made by independent counsel (which shall not be
counsel that provides material services to United) selected by United and
reasonably acceptable to such officer or director. United shall comply with
any agreements that contain any indemnification provisions between Georgetown,
on the one hand, and its respective directors and officers on the other hand;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that Georgetown agrees to exercise its reasonable
best efforts to obtain amendments to such agreements prior to the Effective
Date so that terms of any such agreement aligns with the time periods set
forth in this Section 6.10. 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, United shall
(i) maintain in effect (A) the current provisions regarding indemnification
of and the advancement of expenses to Indemnified Parties contained in the
Georgetown Certificate and the Georgetown Bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) and (B) any indemnification agreements of Georgetown with or for
the benefit of any Indemnified Parties existing on the date hereof, and (ii)
indemnify the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law. For purposes of the foregoing: (i) in the event any claim
is asserted within the six year period during which Georgetown, (A) all such
rights in respect of any such claim shall continue until disposition thereof
and (B) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses
within five business days following receipt of any such claim involving such
Indemnified Party; and (ii) any determination required to be made with respect
to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set
forth under DC Business Code, the Georgetown Certificate or Georgetown Bylaws
or any such agreement, as the case may be, for purposes of the allowance of
indemnification or advancement of expenses, shall be made by independent legal
counsel selected by such Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to
United. The fees and expenses of such independent legal counsel shall be paid
for by United.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, United shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain directors and officers liability
insurance (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against
present and former directors, officers and employees of Georgetown arising
from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time,
which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently
provided by Georgetown; _provided_ , that in no event shall United be required
to expend, on an annual basis, more than 200% of the current amount expended
by Georgetown (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or procure such
directors and officers insurance coverage; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
United is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 6.10(c), United shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as
much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; 

 



44   _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of Georgetown may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to Uniteds insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance.

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.10(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify United thereof; _provided_ that the
failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of United under Section
6.10(a) unless and to the extent that United is actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

(e) If United or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of United shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.10, (i) shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by agreement or otherwise.

(a) At and following the Effective Time (i) United shall provide employees of
Georgetown with employee benefit plans substantially similar to those
provided to similarly situated employees of United, except with respect to the
United Pension Plan, (ii) United shall cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-
existing condition under the Compensation and Benefit Plans) and eligibility
waiting periods under group health plans to be waived with respect to such
employees and their eligible dependents, and (iii) all employees of Georgetown
shall receive credit for years of service with Georgetown and its
predecessors prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual other than accrual for
severance, vacation and paid time off; _provided_ , that, in accordance with
Uniteds policies, no vacation or paid time off shall be thereafter carried
over into a subsequent calendar year) under Uniteds benefit plans, except
with respect to the United Pension Plan. All employees of Georgetown and
their eligible dependents will receive credit for co-payments, deductibles and
out-of-pocket maximums satisfied by such employees and dependents under the

United shall maintain Georgetowns existing employee benefit plans until such
time as United has provided similar plans to employees of Georgetown as
contemplated in the preceding sentence. Employees of Georgetown shall not be
entitled to accrual of benefits or allocation of contributions under Uniteds

prior to the Effective Date, except with respect to any severance, vacation or
paid time off accrual.

 



45 (b) Except for employees of Georgetown with individual agreements that provide
for payment of severance under certain circumstances (who will be paid
severance only in accordance with such agreements and shall not have a right
to employer-paid outplacement services), United agrees that each employee of
Georgetown who is involuntarily terminated by United or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than for cause) on or within the time period set forth in
Section 6.11(b) of Georgetowns Disclosure Schedule, shall receive (i) a
severance payment equal to the amounts set forth in Section 6.11(b)(i) of
Georgetowns Disclosure Schedule, but only if such employee does not have
rights to a severance payment under an employment agreement, in which case no
severance payment shall be made to such employee pursuant to this Section
6.11(b), and (ii) reimbursement of costs associated with reasonable
outplacement services actually incurred no later than the date that is set
forth in Section 6.11(b)(ii) of Georgetowns Disclosure Schedule, so
that after reimbursement, such services will be at no cost to the employee;
provided that (A) documentation of such expenses is provided to United by the
terminated employee and (B) such services are provided by an outplacement
agency selected by United.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Georgetown shall one hundred percent vest all
accrued benefits provided under Georgetowns 401(k) plan, subject to
consummation of the Merger. United and Georgetown shall use reasonable efforts

plan, including, in Uniteds sole discretion, the receipt of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS relating to such termination and (ii)
terminate and liquidate, within 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the
Deferred Compensation Plans.

in Attachment A to Georgetowns Disclosure Schedule.

 

6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of Georgetown and United shall
promptly notify the other of (i) any material change in the normal course of
its business or in the operation of its properties, and to the extent
permitted by applicable law, of any material governmental complaints,
investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be
contemplated), or the institution or the threat of a material claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation involving such party, and (ii) any fact,
event or circumstance known to it that would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.

6.13 _Directors and Officers. _

(a) United shall take all appropriate action so that as of the Effective Time
the number of directors constituting the United Board shall be increased by
one and Michael P. Fitzgerald shall be appointed as a director of United.
United will nominate Michael P. Fitzgerald

 



46  for election as a director at the annual meeting of United immediately
following the Effective Time and solicit proxies for Michael P. Fitzgerald in
the same manner as it does for all other members of Uniteds slate of
directors in connection with such meeting.

the number of directors constituting the Merger Sub shall be increased by two
and two individuals from Georgetown shall be appointed to the board of
directors of Merger Sub one of which shall be Michael P. Fitzgerald who will

Merger Sub shall be subject to the consent of the United Board, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld. United also shall take all appropriate action
so that as of the Effective Time Timothy Veith shall be appointed as the
Market President of Merger Subs Washington, D.C. market.

 

6.14 _Compliance with Laws_. Each of United and Georgetown shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign

the parties and the operation of United and Merger Sub (including the former
operations of Georgetown) after the Merger, and in preparing for the

Effective Time or such later date as United may decide. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) neither United nor Merger Sub shall under any circumstance be
permitted to exercise control of Georgetown prior to the Effective Time, (b)
Georgetown shall not be under any obligation to act in a manner that could
reasonably be deemed to constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or

conditions precedent to the obligations of United to consummate the Merger
contained in Sections 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) cannot be satisfied or fulfilled by

any time prior to the Georgetown Meeting, in order to concurrently enter into
an agreement with respect to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that was
received and considered by Georgetown in compliance with Section 6.06
and that would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable to Georgetowns stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger (a " _Superior_

 



50   _Proposal_ " _)_ ; _provided_ , that (i) this Agreement may be terminated
by Georgetown pursuant to this Section 8.01(h) only after the fifth business
day following Uniteds receipt of written notice from Georgetown advising
United that Georgetown is prepared to enter into an agreement with respect to

(i) The number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Starting
Price (as defined below) (the " _United Ratio_ ") shall be less than 0.80;
and

(ii) (x) the United Ratio shall be less than (y) the number obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each
as defined below) and subtracting 0.20 from the quotient in this clause (ii)
(y) (such number in this clause (ii) (y) being referred to herein as the "
_Index Ratio_ ");

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If Georgetown elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 8.01(i), it shall
give written notice to United (provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such
notice, United shall have the option to increase the consideration to be
received by the holders of Georgetown Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the
Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the
lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained
by dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio
(as then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded
to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of
the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the United
Ratio. If United so elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt
written notice to Georgetown of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.01(i)

51 " _Index Price_ " shall mean the closing price on such date of the Index
Group.

date of the first public announcement of entry into this Agreement.

" _Starting Price_ " shall mean the closing price of a share of United Common
Stock on the NASDAQ (as reported in _The Wall Street Journal,_ or if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source) on the Starting Date.

8.02  _Effect of Termination and Abandonment._ In the event of termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article IX,
no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to
any other party hereunder except (i) as set forth in Section 8.03, (ii) that
termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful
breach of this Agreement giving rise to such termination, and (iii)
Sections 6.03(b), 6.05(b), 8.02, 8.03, 9.05, 9.06, 9.07, 9.08, 9.09 and 9.10

shall be payable in immediately available funds or (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by United pursuant to Section 8.01(g), and prior to that date that
is 12 months after such termination, Georgetown enters into any Acquisition
Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated (regardless of whether

connection with the collection of the Fee under the enforcement of this
Section 8.03, together with interest on such unpaid Fee and costs and

c. At the Effective Time, the Bank Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA and Section 29-309.07 of the DC Business Code.
At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Georgetown shall cease and
the corporate existence of United Bank, as _ _ the Successor Institution, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by

deed, conveyance or other transfer, all of the property, rights, powers and
franchises of Georgetown and United Bank shall vest in United Bank as the
Successor Institution, and the Successor Institution shall be subject to and
be deemed to have assumed all of the debts, liabilities, obligations and
duties of Georgetown and United Bank, and to have succeeded to all of
the relationships, fiduciary or otherwise, of Georgetown and United Bank as
fully and to the same extent as if such property, rights, powers, franchises,
debts, liabilities, obligations, duties and relationships had been originally
acquired, incurred or entered into by the Successor Institution; _provided_ ,

acquire power to engage in any business or to exercise any right, privilege or
franchise which is not conferred on the Successor Institution by the Code of
Virginia, the DC Business Code or applicable regulations. __

Bank."

hold office until his or her successor has been duly appointed by the Board of
Directors of the Successor Institution.

consummation of the Bank Merger and the parties obligations to consummate
the Bank Merger that, (i) the stockholders of Georgetown shall have approved
