Merger, except that (i) upon the exercise or issuance of options, shares of
Brookfield Residential Common Stock shall be issuable in lieu of shares of
Brookfield Homes Common Stock, and (ii) upon the redemption of the deferred
share units, the value of the units will be based on the value of Brookfield
Residential Common Stock. Appropriate adjustments will be made in both the
number of shares of Brookfield Residential Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of such option after the Effective Date and the exercise price of
each such option to preserve the economic value immediately prior to the
Transactions and to reflect the impact of the Transactions. Appropriate
adjustments will also be made in the number of units allocated to a
participant under the Brookfield Residential Deferred Share Unit Plan to
reflect the impact of the Transactions. It is intended that new at-the-money
options of Brookfield Residential will be granted with a value approximately
equivalent to the Black-Scholes value of any out-of-the-money options of
Brookfield Homes being replaced. In accordance with the terms of the
Brookfield Homes Deferred Share Unit Plan, Brookfield Homes director deferred
share unit holders may elect, as a result of their separation from service, to
receive either cash or to replace their Brookfield Homes deferred share units
with Brookfield Residential deferred share units pursuant to the foregoing.

3.06 _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Brookfield Residential
Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder
of record of shares of Brookfield Homes Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to a fraction of a share of Brookfield Residential Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Brookfield Residential Stock that otherwise would be
received by such holder of record) shall, upon the surrender of the
certificate, if any, representing such share of Brookfield Homes Stock in the
manner provided in Section 3.08(b) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in the manner provided in Section 3.08(e), receive from Brookfield Residential
an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying such fraction by the last
reported sales price of the Brookfield Residential Common Stock, as reported
on the NYSE composite transactions reporting system (as reported in the Wall
Street Journal (Northeast edition), or if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source mutually selected by Brookfield Office Properties and
Brookfield Homes) on the first trading day immediately following the
Effective Date.



 

10 3.07 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Section 262
of the DGCL is applicable to the Merger, shares of Brookfield Homes Preferred
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and which are held by shareholders who have not voted such shares in favor of
the Merger, who will have delivered, prior to any vote on the Merger, a
written demand for the appraisal of such shares in the manner provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, will not have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissenters rights (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") will not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Preferred Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.02 but the holders
thereof will be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of
the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for
such shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will receive payment therefor
from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder of Dissenting Shares will have effectively
withdrawn such holders demand for appraisal of such shares or lost such
holders right to appraisal and payment of such shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL, such holder will forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and
each such share will thereupon be deemed to have been canceled, extinguished
and converted, as of the Effective Date, into and represent the right
to receive distribution from the Surviving Corporation of the Preferred
Merger Consideration, as provided in Section 3.02.

 

(b) Brookfield Homes will give Brookfield Residential (i) prompt notice of any
written demand for appraisal, any withdrawal of a demand for appraisal and
any other instrument served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by
Brookfield Homes and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under such Section 262 of
the DGCL. Brookfield Homes will not, except with the prior written consent of
Brookfield Residential, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demand for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demand.

 

3.08 _Exchange Agent; Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Brookfield Residential
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Brookfield
Homes to act as the exchange agent for the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). As
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Brookfield Residential
will make available to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Brookfield Homes Common Stock and Brookfield Homes Preferred Stock,
the shares of Brookfield Residential Common Stock and Brookfield Residential
Preferred Stock to be provided in exchange for Brookfield Homes Common
Stock and Brookfield Homes Preferred Stock, respectively, and cash in an
amount sufficient to pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 3.06, upon consummation of the Merger as set forth in
Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, respectively (the "Exchange Fund").

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, and in any event no later than five Business Days thereafter, the
Exchange Agent shall, and Brookfield Residential shall cause the Exchange
Agent to, mail to each holder of record of a certificate (the " _Brookfield
Homes Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Brookfield Homes Stock or non-certificated
shares of Brookfield Homes Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book Entry
Shares_ ") whose shares were converted into and became the right to receive
shares of Brookfield Residential Stock pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section
3.02, respectively, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Brookfield Homes
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Brookfield Homes
Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Brookfield Residential may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Brookfield Homes Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for
certificates representing whole shares of Brookfield Residential Stock (the "
_Brookfield Residential Certificates_ ") and cash payable in respect thereof
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.06. With respect to
uncertificated shares of Brookfield Homes Stock held through "direct
registration," Brookfield Residential shall implement procedures with the
Exchange Agent for effecting the exchange of such directly registered
uncertificated shares 



 

11  of Brookfield Home Stock and payment of cash in lieu of any fractional
shares pursuant to Section 3.06 as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time. Upon surrender of a Brookfield Homes Certificate or Book Entry Shares
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as
may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Brookfield Homes Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the number and class of shares of Brookfield Residential
Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article III (which, at the election of Brookfield Residential, may be in
uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested by
the holder of record or is otherwise required by applicable laws) and payment
in lieu of fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.06, and the Brookfield Homes Certificate so surrendered shall be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Brookfield Homes
Certificate after the Effective Time, exchange may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Brookfield Homes Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Brookfield Homes Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer and shall be accompanied by evidence
satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of such exchange in the name other than that of the registered
holder of such Brookfield Homes Certificate or instrument either has
been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.08, each Brookfield Homes Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender a Brookfield Residential Certificate or
Certificates evidencing the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled in accordance with Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, as the case may
be, and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of any fractional
shares in accordance with Section 3.06 and any dividends and other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.08(f).

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Brookfield Homes Stock_. All shares of
Brookfield Residential Stock issued pursuant to the Merger, including any
Brookfield Residential Certificates issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Brookfield Homes Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Article III, shall be deemed to have been issued and paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Brookfield
Homes Stock theretofore represented by such certificates or Book Entry Shares;
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Date which may have been declared or made by Brookfield Homes on
such shares of Brookfield Homes Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Date. From and after the
Effective Date, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Brookfield
Homes Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Date, Brookfield Homes Certificates are presented to
Brookfield Residential, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III, except as otherwise provided by Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Brookfield Homes
Certificates or Book Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Brookfield Residential, upon demand, and
any holder of Brookfield Homes Certificates or Book Entry Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Brookfield Residential (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) with respect to the Brookfield Residential Stock, cash in lieu
of fractional shares and any dividends or other distributions with respect
thereto payable upon due surrender of their Brookfield Homes Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Brookfield Residential, Brookfield Homes or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Brookfield Homes Certificate for
Brookfield Residential Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Brookfield
Homes Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Brookfield Homes
Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Brookfield
Residential, the posting by 



 

12  such Person of a bond in such sum as Brookfield Residential may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
Brookfield Homes with respect to such Brookfield Homes Certificate(s), the
Exchange Agent will issue the Brookfield Residential Certificates pursuant to
Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, as the case may be, deliverable in respect of
the shares of Brookfield Residential Stock represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Brookfield Homes Certificates.

(f) _Dividends; Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to Brookfield Residential Stock with a record date after the Effective
Date shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Brookfield Homes
Certificate or Book Entry Shares with respect to the shares of
Brookfield Residential Stock represented thereby, and all such dividends or
other distributions, if any, shall be paid by Brookfield Residential to the
Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until
the surrender of such Brookfield Homes Certificate or Book Entry Shares in
accordance with this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such
Brookfield Homes Certificate or Book Entry Shares there shall be paid to the
holder of a Brookfield Homes Certificate or Book Entry Shares representing the
right to receive shares of Brookfield Residential Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Date
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Brookfield Residential Stock
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Date but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Brookfield Residential Stock. Brookfield
Residential shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these
purposes, if necessary.

3.09 _Withholding Taxes_. Brookfield Residential shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article III any
such amounts as are required under the Code, or any applicable provision of
federal, state, provincial, local or foreign tax Law; provided, however, that
if such withholding may be eliminated or reduced through the delivery of any
certificate or other documentation, Brookfield Residential shall provide
each holder of Brookfield Homes Stock with a reasonable opportunity to
deliver such certificate or other documentation. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Brookfield Residential, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of shares of Brookfield Homes Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Brookfield Residential.

Effect. Brookfield Homes has made available to Brookfield Office Properties
complete and correct copies of its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended
(the " _Brookfield Homes Certificate_ "), and Bylaws, as amended (the "

such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure
to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have an Brookfield Homes Material Adverse Effect. No Subsidiary of

requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of

be expected to have an Brookfield Homes Material Adverse Effect.

 

(i) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will, in and of itself, (i) result in any payment becoming
due to any Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any

all such Brookfield Office

 



 

30  Properties Material Contracts have been delivered or have been made
available by Brookfield Office Properties to Brookfield Homes. Each of the
Brookfield Office Properties Material Contracts is in full force and effect
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Brookfield Office
Properties or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and is enforceable in
accordance with its respective terms. Neither Brookfield Office Properties
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Brookfield Office
Properties, any other party is in breach of or in default under any Brookfield
Office Properties Material Contract, except for such breaches and defaults as
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Neither Brookfield Office Properties nor any of its Subsidiaries is party

its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Laws as they relate to
the BPO Residential Businesses or the Contributed Subsidiaries, except for
instances of noncompliance or possible noncompliance that individually or in
the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect. None of Brookfield
Office Properties or any of its Subsidiaries has received, since December 31,
2007, a written notice alleging or relating to a possible violation of any
Laws applicable to the BPO Residential Businesses which violations would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Brookfield Office Properties Material
Adverse Effect. Brookfield Office Properties and its Subsidiaries have in
effect all material Permits (including Environmental Permits) necessary to
carry on the BPO Residential Businesses as now conducted, and there has
occurred no violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) under any such Permit, except for violations or defaults that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect. There
is no event which has occurred that, to the knowledge of Brookfield
Office Properties, would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation,
cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification of any such Permit, other
than such revocations, cancellations, non-renewals or modifications that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect. The Transactions, in and
of themselves, would not cause the revocation, cancellation, non-renewal or
adverse modification of any such Permits that individually or in the
aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Brookfield Office Properties
Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.13 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 6.13(a) of the Brookfield Office Properties Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a correct and complete list of all BPO Residential Businesses
Plans.

(b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents, with respect to
each of BPO Residential Businesses Plans (other than a "multiemployer plan"
as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or under applicable pension
legislation), have been delivered to Brookfield Homes by Brookfield Office
Properties, to the extent applicable: (i) any plans, all amendments and
attachments thereto and related trust documents, insurance contracts or other
funding arrangements, and amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Forms 5500
and all schedules thereto and the most recent actuarial report, if any; (iii)
the most recent IRS determination letter; and (iv) summary plan descriptions.

 

(c) The BPO Residential Businesses Plans have been maintained in accordance
with their terms and with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws, and none of the BPO Residential Businesses (or any of their
Subsidiaries) or any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect
to the BPO Residential Businesses Plans has engaged in a non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 406 of ERISA as applicable, except as individually or in the aggregate
have not had and 



 

31  would not reasonably be expected to have a Brookfield Office Properties
Material Adverse Effect. No fiduciary has any liability for breach of
fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any BPO Residential Businesses
Plan, except as individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Brookfield Office Properties
Material Adverse Effect.

(d) The BPO Residential Businesses Plans intended to qualify under Section 401
of the Code or under any favoring provisions of applicable tax Laws are so
qualified and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation
under Section 501 of the Code are so exempt, except as individually or in the
aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an
Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect.

(e) None of the BPO Residential Businesses or any trade or business (whether
or not incorporated) that is treated as a single employer, with any of them
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code has any current or
contingent liability with respect to (i) a plan subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code or (ii) any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or under
applicable pension Laws. Each BPO Residential Businesses Plan that is
intended to meet the requirements for tax favored treatment under Subchapter B
of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code meets such requirements, with such
exceptions that individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have an Brookfield Office Properties Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(f) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any BPO
Residential Businesses Plans (including workers compensation) or by Law
(without regard to any waivers granted under Section 412 of the Code), to any
funds or trusts established thereunder or in connection therewith have been
made by the due date thereof (including any valid extension).

(g) There are no pending actions, claims or lawsuits that have been asserted
or instituted against the BPO Residential Businesses Plans, the assets of any
of the trusts under the BPO Residential Businesses Plans or the sponsor or
administrator of any of the BPO Residential Businesses Plans, or against any
fiduciary of the BPO Residential Businesses Plans with respect to the
operation of any of the BPO Residential Businesses Plans (other than routine
individual benefit claims), nor do the BPO Residential Businesses have any
knowledge of facts that could form the basis for any such action, claim or
lawsuit, other than such actions, claims or lawsuits that individually or in
the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect. 

(h) None of the BPO Residential Businesses Plans provide for post-employment
life or health insurance, benefits or coverage for any participant or any
beneficiary of a participant, except as may be required under COBRA, and at
the expense of the participant or the participants beneficiary. Each of the
BPO Residential Businesses and any ERISA Affiliate which maintains a "group
health plan" within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code has complied
with the notice and continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code,
COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations
thereunder, except where the failure to comply individually or in the
aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect.

 

(i) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, neither the execution
and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will, in and of itself, (i) result in any payment becoming
due to any Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
BPO Residential Businesses Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any BPO Residential
Businesses Plan or (iv) result in any obligation to fund any trust or other
arrangement with respect to compensation or benefits under a BPO Residential
Businesses Plan.

(j) The BPO Residential Businesses do not have a contract, plan or commitment,
whether legally binding or not, to create any additional BPO Residential
Businesses Plan or to modify any existing BPO Residential Businesses Plan,
except as required by applicable Law or tax qualification requirement.

 



 

32 (k) Any individual who performs services for the BPO Residential Businesses or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization
other than such individual) and who is not treated as an employee of the BPO
Residential Businesses for federal income tax purposes by the BPO Residential
Businesses is not an employee for such purposes, except as individually or in
the aggregate, together with any breach or breaches of Section 6.13(c) hereof
(without regard to any materiality or Brookfield Office Properties Material
Adverse Effect qualifiers therein), has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect.

(l) The BPO Residential Businesses are not a party to any Contract or other
arrangement which provides for the payment of any amount which would not be
deductible by reason of Section 162(m) (to the extent not properly reflected
on the BPO Residential Businesses applicable tax returns) or Section 280G of
the Code.

6.14 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Brookfield Office Properties and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf (taking into account
any extension of time within which to file), all material tax returns required
to be filed by it with respect to the BPO Residential Businesses, and all such
filed tax returns are, with respect to the BPO Residential Businesses,
correct and complete in all material respects. All taxes shown to be due on
such tax returns with respect to the BPO Residential Businesses have been
timely paid.

 

(b) The most recent Brookfield Office Properties Financial Statements reflect
an adequate reserve for all material taxes payable by Brookfield Office
Properties and its Subsidiaries with respect to the BPO Residential Businesses
for all taxable periods and portion thereof through the date covered by such
financial statements. No material deficiency with respect to taxes has
been proposed, asserted or assessed against Brookfield Office Properties or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the BPO Residential Businesses that
has not been paid in full or fully resolved in favor of the taxpayer.

 

(c) The U.S. federal income tax returns filed by each of Brookfield Office
Properties Subsidiaries involved in the BPO Residential Businesses have been
examined by and settled with the IRS (or, to the knowledge of Brookfield
Office Properties, the applicable statute of limitations has expired) for all
years through December 31, 2006. The Canadian federal income tax returns with
respect to the BPO Residential Businesses and those filed by each of
Brookfield Office Properties Subsidiaries involved in the BPO Residential
Businesses have been examined by and settled with the Canadian tax authorities
(or, to the knowledge of Brookfield Office Properties, the applicable statute
of limitations has expired), for all years through December 31, 2005. All
material assessments for taxes due with respect to such completed and settled
examinations or any concluded litigation have been fully paid.

(d) Neither Brookfield Office Properties nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any obligation under any tax sharing or tax indemnification agreement (either
with any Person or any tax authority) with respect to material taxes relating
to the BPO Residential Businesses.

 

(e) No audit or other administrative or court proceedings are pending with any
taxing authority with respect to any federal, state, provincial or local
income or other material taxes of Brookfield Office Properties or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to the BPO Residential Businesses, and no written notice
thereof has been received by Brookfield Office Properties or any of
its Subsidiaries. No issue has been raised in writing by any taxing authority

to waive or cause to be waived any right of appraisal with respect to such
shares; _provided, however_ , that if the Board of Directors of Brookfield
Homes shall have withdrawn its recommendation with respect to the approval of

or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or legal proceedings or
government investigations. Nothing in this Section 9.03 shall require any
party hereto to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of such party would result in (i) the disclosure of

challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of

respective Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the Transactions,
Brookfield Residential or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) not compete in any
geographic area or line of business or (C) restrict the manner in which, or
whether, Brookfield Office Properties, Brookfield Homes, Brookfield
Residential or any of their respective Affiliates may carry on business in any
part of the world, which, in the case of any of clauses (A) through 



 

49  (C) above, would reasonably be likely to have a Brookfield Office Properties
Material Adverse Effect, an Brookfield Homes Material Adverse Effect or
materially impair the long-term benefits sought to be derived from the
Transactions.

9.06 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Date now existing in favor
of the Brookfield Homes Covered Persons (as defined below) as provided in the
Brookfield Homes Certificate or Brookfield Homes Bylaws (in each case, as in
effect on the date hereof) or any indemnification agreement existing on
the date of this Agreement including, but not limited to, rights relating to
advancement of expenses and indemnification rights to which such persons are
entitled because they are serving as a director, officer, agent or employee of
another entity at the request of Brookfield Homes or any of its Subsidiaries,
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further
action, as of the Effective Date and shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Brookfield

expenses to, the Brookfield Homes Covered Persons to the same extent such
persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of
the date hereof by Brookfield Homes pursuant to the Brookfield Homes
Certificate and Brookfield Homes Bylaws or any applicable indemnification
agreement and to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL and not expressly
prohibited by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other applicable Law; _provided,
however_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether
an Brookfield Homes Covered Persons conduct complies with the standards set
forth under the DGCL, the Brookfield Homes Certificate or Brookfield Homes
Bylaws or any such agreement, as the case may be, shall be made by independent
legal counsel jointly selected by such Brookfield Homes Covered Person and
Brookfield Residential; and _provided, further_ , that nothing in this
Section 9.06(a) shall impair any rights of any Brookfield Homes Covered
Person.

(b) For six years after the Effective Date, Brookfield Residential shall
maintain, at its own expense, tail insurance coverage, also known as sunset
coverage, extending the reporting period for directors and officers
liability and fiduciary claims against any of the Brookfield Homes Covered
Persons in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Date, (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided,
however, that Brookfield Residential may substitute therefor policies
of Brookfield Residential containing terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable to such Brookfield Homes Covered Persons and subject
to review and approval by an insurance designate appointed by the Brookfield
Homes Covered Persons. 

(c) The term " _Brookfield Homes Covered Persons_ " means the current or
former directors and officers, and other persons covered by the existing
directors and officers insurance policy, of Brookfield Homes and its
Subsidiaries and including fiduciaries under employee benefit plans of
Brookfield Homes. The covenants contained in this Section 9.06 are intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Brookfield
Homes Covered Persons and their respective heirs and legal representatives,
and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Brookfield
Homes Covered Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise.

(d) If Brookfield Residential or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Brookfield Residential shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 9.06.

the Transactions are not consummated, Brookfield Office Properties and
Brookfield Homes shall each bear and pay (or, if already paid by Brookfield
Residential, shall each reimburse Brookfield Residential in respect of) 50% of
the reasonable and customary expenses incurred by Brookfield Residential to
Third Parties in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that Brookfield Homes and Brookfield Office
Properties shall have first received from Brookfield Residential

fees and expenses.

(a) Brookfield Office Properties and Brookfield Homes shall develop a joint

52 9.14 _Indemnity_.

 

(a) _Indemnification by Brookfield Office Properties_. From and after the
Effective Date, Brookfield Office Properties agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless (i) Brookfield Residential and each of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the
respective directors, managers, officers and employees of each of Brookfield
Residential and its Subsidiaries and (iii) the respective successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing (each, a " _Brookfield Residential
Indemnitee_ "), on an After-Tax Basis, from and against any and all Losses
incurred by such Brookfield Residential Indemnitees in connection with
or arising from the failure to pay, perform or discharge any liabilities or
obligations of Brookfield Office Properties that are not BPO Residential
Liabilities; _provided_ , _however_ , that Brookfield Office Properties shall
not be required to indemnify and hold harmless under this Section 9.14(a)
with respect to Losses incurred by Brookfield Residential Indemnitees unless
the aggregate amount of such Losses subject to indemnification by Brookfield
Office Properties exceeds $5 million (other than any Losses in connection
with or arising from the failure to pay, perform or discharge any indebtedness
for borrowed money other than the Existing Debt, which shall not be subject to
such $5 million Loss threshold and which shall be immediately indemnifiable);
and _provided, further_ , that Brookfield Office Properties shall not be
required to indemnify and hold harmless with respect to Losses incurred by
Brookfield Residential Indemnitees unless Brookfield Office Properties shall
have received one or more written notices of Losses prior to the third
anniversary of the Effective Date.

 

(b) _Indemnification by Brookfield Residential_. From and after the Effective
Date, Brookfield Residential agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i)
Brookfield Office Properties and each of its Subsidiaries (other than
Brookfield Residential and its Subsidiaries), (ii) the respective directors,
managers, officers and employees of each of Brookfield Office Properties and
its Subsidiaries (other than Brookfield Residential and its Subsidiaries) and
(iii) the respective successors and assigns of each of the foregoing (each, a
" _Brookfield Office Properties Indemnitee_ "), on an After-Tax Basis, from
and against any and all Losses incurred by such Brookfield Office Properties
Indemnitees in connection with or arising from the failure to pay, perform or
discharge any BPO Residential Liabilities; _provided, however_ , that
Brookfield Residential will not be required to indemnify and hold harmless
under this Section 9.14(b) with respect to Losses incurred by Brookfield
Office Properties Indemnitees unless the aggregate amount of such Losses
subject to indemnification by Brookfield Residential exceed $5 million (other
than any Losses in connection with or arising from the failure to pay, perform
or discharge any Existing Debt, which shall not be subject to such $5 million
Loss threshold and which shall be immediately indemnifiable); and _provided,
further_ , that Brookfield Residential shall not be required to indemnify and
hold harmless with respect to Losses incurred by Brookfield Office Properties
Indemnitees unless Brookfield Residential shall have received one or more
written notices of Losses prior to the third anniversary of the Effective
Date.

(c)  _Procedure for Indemnification_. The procedure for indemnification will
be as follows:

(i) The party claiming indemnification (the " _Claimant_ ") will promptly
give notice to the party from which indemnification is claimed (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of any claim, whether between the parties or brought
by a Third Party, specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis for the
claim. If the claim relates to an action, suit, or proceeding filed by a Third
Party against Claimant, such notice will be given by Claimant within fifteen
(15) Business Days after written notice of such action, suit, or proceeding
was given to Claimant. The Claimants failure to give such notice timely will
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it otherwise may
have to the Claimant except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure.

(ii) With respect to claims solely between the parties hereto, following
receipt of notice from the Claimant of a claim, the Indemnifying Party will
have thirty (30) days to make such investigation of the claim as the
Indemnifying Party deems necessary or desirable. For the purposes of
such investigation, the Claimant agrees to make available to the Indemnifying
Party and its authorized representatives the information relied upon by the
Claimant to substantiate the claim. If the Claimant and the Indemnifying Party
agree at or prior to the expiration



 

53  of such thirty (30) day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension
thereof) to the validity and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying Party will
immediately pay to the Claimant the full amount of the claim. If the Claimant
and the Indemnifying Party do not agree within the thirty (30) day period (or
any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), the Claimant may seek appropriate
remedy at law or equity.

 

(iii) With respect to any claim by a Third Party as to which the Claimant is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party will
have the right at its own expense, to participate in or assume control of the
defense of such claim (subject to subsection (iv) below), and the Claimant
will cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party, subject to reimbursement
for actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Claimant as the result of a
request by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
control of the defense of any Third-Party claim, the Claimant will have
the right to participate in the defense of such claim at its own expense
(except that the Claimant will have the right to participate in the defense of
such claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense if (A) the Claimant has been
advised by its counsel that use of the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnifying Party and the Claimant would present a conflict of interest,
which will be deemed to include any case where there may be a legal defense or
claim available to the Claimant that is inconsistent with those available to
the Indemnifying Party, or (B) the Indemnifying Party fails to defend or
prosecute such claim within a reasonable time). If the Indemnifying Party does
not elect to assume control or otherwise participate in the defense of any
Third-Party claim, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by the results
obtained by the Claimant with respect to such claim.

 

(iv) The Indemnifying Party may not control the defense of any claim, without
the written consent of the Claimant, if (A) the Claimant has been advised by
its counsel that use of the same counsel to represent both the Indemnifying
Party and the Claimant would present a conflict of interest, or (B) the claim
involves any material risk of the sale, forfeiture, or loss of, or the
creation of any Lien (other than a judgment lien) on, any material property of
the Claimant or could entail a risk of criminal liability to the Claimant.

 

(v) Indemnification of Losses under this Agreement will be net of any
insurance proceeds actually paid to the Claimant with respect to the event
giving rise to such Loss, but no Claimant will have, as of the Effective Time,
any obligation under this Agreement to make any claim under any insurance
policy that may be applicable to such event.

 

(vi) After the Effective Time, the rights set forth in this Section 9.14 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto against the other
parties hereto for misrepresentations or breaches of covenants contained in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will prevent the
parties hereto from bringing an action based upon allegations of fraud in
connection with this Agreement. In the event such action is brought, the
prevailing partys attorneys fees and costs will be paid by the nonprevailing
party.

 

(vii) If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of this Section
9.14(c) and Section 9.15(c) (relating to tax contests), the provisions of
Section 9.15(c) shall control with respect to tax contests.

(d) _Indemnification Payments on After Tax Basis_. The indemnity payments
hereunder with respect to any Losses shall be calculated on an " _After-Tax
Basis_ ", which shall mean an amount which is sufficient to compensate the
indemnified party for the event giving rise to such Losses (the "
_Indemnified Event_ "), determined after taking into account (1) all increases
in federal, state, local or other taxes (including estimated taxes) payable by
the indemnified party as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment (as
a result of the indemnity payment being included in income, resulting in a
reduction of tax basis, or otherwise), _provided, however_ , that the
Brookfield Office Properties Indemnitees and Brookfield Residential
Indemnitees agree to report each indemnification payment made in respect of
any Losses as an adjustment to the amount of the Contribution for federal
income tax purposes unless the indemnified party determines in good faith that
such reporting position is incorrect (it being understood that if any
reporting position is later disallowed in any administrative or court
proceedings, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party for
the effects of such disallowance), (2) to the extent not previously taken
into account in computing the amount of such Losses, all increases in



 

54  federal, state, local or other taxes (including estimated taxes) payable by
the indemnified party for all affected taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Effective Date as a result of the Indemnified Event and (3) to the
extent not previously taken into account in computing the amount of such
Losses, all reductions in federal, state, local or other taxes (including
estimated taxes) realized by the indemnified party for all affected taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Effective Date as a result of the
Indemnified Event. All calculations shall be made at the time of the relevant
indemnification payment using reasonable assumptions (as agreed to by
the indemnifying and indemnified party) and present value concepts (using a
discount rate equal to the applicable federal rate in effect at the time of
the Indemnified Event (based on the Federal mid-term rate) using semi-annual
compounding.

 

9.15 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 

(i) Brookfield Office Properties shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to
Section 9.14 shall indemnify and hold harmless each Brookfield Residential
Indemnitee, on an After-Tax Basis, from and against any and all Losses
incurred by any such Brookfield Residential Indemnitee in connection with or
arising from (A) all taxes imposed on any Contributed Subsidiary or
any Subsidiary thereof, or for which the Contributed Subsidiary or any such
Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of a
Group (including, without limitation, taxes for which the Contributed
Subsidiary or any such Subsidiary may be liable pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or similar provision of state, local or foreign
law as a result of having been a member of a Group and any taxes resulting
from the Contributed Subsidiary or any such Subsidiary ceasing to be a member
of any Group) for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Effective Date,
(B) all income taxes payable with respect to any United States federal, state,
or foreign, consolidated, combined or unitary income tax return of a
Brookfield Office Properties Group (" _Brookfield Office Properties Retained
Taxes_ "), and (C) all income or transfer taxes (excluding any value added or
similar tax) imposed as a direct result of the restructuring of the BPO
Residential Businesses contemplated by Section 8.04, except to the extent such
income or transfer tax liability is reflected in the consolidated Net
Operating Working Capital of the Contributed Subsidiaries. As used herein,
a " _Group_ " is any "affiliated group" (as defined in Section 1504(a) of the
Code without regard to the limitations contained in Section 1504(b) of the
Code) that, at any time on or before the Effective Date, includes or has
included the Contributed Subsidiary or any Subsidiary thereof or any
predecessor of or successor to the Contributed Subsidiary or any such
Subsidiary (or another such predecessor or successor), or any other group of
corporations that, at any time on or before the Effective Date, files or has
filed tax returns on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with the
Contributed Subsidiary or any such Subsidiary or any predecessor of or
successor to the Contributed Subsidiary or any such Subsidiary (or another
such predecessor or successor); and a " _Brookfield Office Properties Group_ "
is a Group that includes Brookfield Office Properties or any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Brookfield Office Properties, but does not include a
Group consisting only of Contributed Subsidiaries.

(ii) Brookfield Residential shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to
Section 9.14 shall indemnify and hold harmless each Brookfield Office
Properties Indemnitee, on an After-Tax Basis, from and against any and all
Losses incurred by any such Brookfield Office Properties Indemnitee in
connection with or arising from all taxes imposed on any Contributed
Subsidiary or any Subsidiary thereof other than taxes for which Brookfield
Office Properties is responsible pursuant to paragraph (a)(i).

 

(iii) (A) The decision to file any amended tax return or claim for a tax
refund attributable to any Contributed Subsidiary or any Subsidiary thereof
with respect to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Effective Date
shall be made in the sole and absolute discretion of Brookfield Office
Properties; _provided, however_ , that no amended tax return or claim for a
tax refund attributable to the carryback of losses, credits or similar items
of any Contributed Subsidiary or any Subsidiary thereof from a taxable year or
period that begins after the Effective Date shall be filed without the prior
written consent of Brookfield Residential.



 

55 (B) If Brookfield Office Properties becomes entitled to a credit with respect
to, or refund of, taxes for which it is liable under this Agreement,
Brookfield Office Properties shall retain the amount of such refund or credit
including, without limitation, refunds or credits attributable to the
carryback of losses, credits or similar items of any Contributed Subsidiary
or any Subsidiary thereof from a taxable year or period that begins after the
Effective Date.

 

(C) If Brookfield Residential, any Contributed Subsidiary or any Subsidiary
thereof receives a credit with respect to, or refund of, any tax for which
Brookfield Office Properties is liable under this Agreement, such recipient
shall pay over to Brookfield Office Properties the amount of such refund or
credit within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto including,
without limitation, refunds or credits attributable to the carryback of
losses, credits or similar items of any Contributed Subsidiary or any
Subsidiary thereof from a taxable year or period that begins after the
Effective Date. In the event that any refund or credit of taxes for which a
payment has been made to Brookfield Office Properties by such recipient is
subsequently reduced or disallowed, Brookfield Office Properties shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Brookfield Residential Indemnitees by reason
of the reduction or disallowance.

(D) For purposes of the foregoing, tax refunds shall include any interest that
is paid as part of the payment of such refunds, reduced by the increase in
the original payees federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes payable
attributable to such interest after taking into account any offsetting
deductions or credits. 

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Brookfield Office Properties shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (x) all tax
returns that are required to be filed with respect to Brookfield Office
Properties Retained Taxes and (y) all tax returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to each Contributed Subsidiary and each Subsidiary
thereof, as the case may be, that are due on or before the Effective Date; in
each case Brookfield Office Properties shall remit or cause to be remitted any
taxes due in respect of such tax returns.

 

(ii) Brookfield Residential shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when
due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other tax
returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to each Contributed
Subsidiary and each Subsidiary thereof and Brookfield Residential shall remit
or cause to be remitted any taxes due in respect of such tax returns. 

(iii) Brookfield Office Properties or Brookfield Residential shall reimburse
the other party the taxes for which Brookfield Office Properties or
Brookfield Residential is liable pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section
9.15 but which are remitted in respect of any tax return to be filed by the
other party pursuant to this paragraph (b) upon the written request of the
party entitled to reimbursement setting forth in detail the computation of the
amount owed by Brookfield Office Properties or Brookfield Residential, as the
case may be, but in no event earlier than 10 days prior to the due date
for paying such taxes. Except as may be required by Law and except for
Brookfield Office Properties Retained Taxes, all tax returns which Brookfield
Office Properties files or causes to be filed in accordance with this
paragraph (b) shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past
practice and, on such tax returns, no position shall be taken, election made
or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
methods used in preparing and filing similar tax returns in prior periods
(including, but not limited to, positions, elections or methods which would
have the effect of deferring income to periods for which Brookfield
Residential is liable under paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 9.15 or
accelerating deductions to periods for which Brookfield Office Properties is
liable under paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 9.15).

 

(c) _Contest Provisions_.

 

(i) Brookfield Residential shall promptly notify Brookfield Office Properties
in writing upon receipt by Brookfield Residential, any of its Affiliates or,
after the Effective Date, any Contributed Subsidiary or any



 

56  Subsidiary thereof of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign tax audits or assessments which may materially affect the tax
liabilities of any Contributed Subsidiary or any Subsidiary thereof for any
period beginning prior to the Effective Date.

(ii) Brookfield Office Properties shall have the sole right to represent the
interests of each Contributed Subsidiary and each Subsidiary thereof in any
tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating solely to tax
liabilities for which Brookfield Office Properties would be required to
indemnify the Brookfield Residential Indemnitees pursuant to paragraph (a) of
this Section 9.15 and to employ counsel of Brookfield Office Properties
choice at Brookfield Office Properties expense. Except for an audit
or proceeding relating to Brookfield Office Properties Retained Taxes,
Brookfield Residential and its representatives shall be permitted, at
Brookfield Residentials expense, to be present at, and participate in, any
such audit or proceeding to the extent related to a Contributed Subsidiary or
any Subsidiary thereof. Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on
Brookfield Residential or any officer, employee or agent thereof any
obligation to defend any Contributed Subsidiary or any Subsidiary thereof in
any such tax audit or administrative or court proceeding. Except for an audit
or proceeding relating to Brookfield Office Properties Retained Taxes,
Brookfield Office Properties shall not settle, either administratively
or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for taxes which would
adversely affect the liability for taxes of any Contributed Subsidiary or any
Subsidiary thereof for any period after the Effective Date without the prior
written consent of Brookfield Residential, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(iii) Brookfield Residential shall have the sole right to represent the
interests of each Contributed Subsidiary and each Subsidiary thereof in any
tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating solely to tax
liabilities for which Brookfield Office Properties would not be required
to indemnify the Brookfield Residential Indemnitees pursuant to paragraph (a)
of this Section 9.15 and to employ counsel of Brookfield Residentials choice
at Brookfield Residentials expense. Brookfield Office Properties and
its representatives shall be permitted, at Brookfield Office Properties
expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or proceeding.

 

(iv) Except for an audit or proceeding relating to Brookfield Office
Properties Retained Taxes, with respect to any tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding which jointly relates to Brookfield Office Properties and a
Contributed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof for periods beginning prior to
the Effective Time, Brookfield Office Properties and Brookfield
Residential shall try to separate the proceedings into two proceedings, one
solely regarding Brookfield Office Properties and one solely regarding the
Contributed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof. To the extent Brookfield Office
Properties and Brookfield Residential are able to separate such proceedings,
the proceeding solely regarding Brookfield Office Properties shall be governed
by the provisions of paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 9.15, and the
proceeding solely regarding the Contributed Subsidiary or Subsidiary thereof
shall be governed by paragraph (c)(iii) of this Section 9.15. To the extent
that Brookfield Office Properties and Brookfield Residential are not able to
separate such proceedings, Brookfield Office Properties and Brookfield
Residential shall cooperate with each other so that the contest of tax
liabilities for which Brookfield Office Properties is responsible under
paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 9.15 is governed to the greatest extent
possible by paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 9.15 and the contest of tax
liabilities for which Brookfield Residential is responsible under paragraph
(a)(ii) of this Section 9.15 is governed to the greatest extent possible by
paragraph (c)(iii) of this Section 9.15.

9.16 _Covenant Not to Compete or Solicit Business_.

 

(a) In furtherance of the Transactions contemplated hereby and more
effectively to protect the value and goodwill of the BPO
Residential Businesses, Brookfield Office Properties covenants and agrees
that, for a period ending on the third anniversary of the Effective Date,
Brookfield Office Properties will not, nor will it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, other than by virtue of or through its ownership of shares

correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Date as
though made on the Effective Date, except to the extent such representations
and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of
such earlier date, except in any case where the failure of the
representations and warranties to be true and correct individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Brookfield Office Properties Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , that if a



 

59  representation and warranty is true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement but, due to an intervening event not involving a breach by
Brookfield Office Properties of its obligations under Section 8.02, is not
true and correct as of the Effective Date as though made on the Effective
Date, such failure of the representation and warranty to be true and correct
will not be deemed to cause the condition in this Section 10.02(a) to be not
satisfied unless such failure is also reasonably likely to materially
adversely affect or materially impair, after the Effective Date, the business,
properties, financial condition or results of operations of Brookfield
Residential. Brookfield Homes shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Brookfield Office Properties by the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer and a senior vice president of Brookfield Office

that it will or is reasonably likely to materially adversely effect or
materially impair, after the Effective Date, the business, properties,
financial condition or operations of Brookfield Residential.

date, except in any case where the failure of the representations and
warranties to be true and correct individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have an Brookfield Homes Material
Adverse Effect;  _provided_ , that if a representation and warranty is true
and correct as of the date of this Agreement but, due to an intervening event
not involving a breach by Brookfield Homes of its obligations under Section
8.01, is not true and correct as of the Effective Date as though made on the
Effective Date, such failure of such representation and warranty to be true
and correct will not be deemed to cause the condition in this Section 10.03(a)
to be not satisfied unless such failure is also reasonably



 

60  likely to materially adversely affect or materially impair, after the
Effective Date, the business, properties, financial condition or results of
operations of Brookfield Residential. Brookfield Office Properties shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Brookfield Homes by the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of Brookfield Homes to such
effect.

 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Brookfield Homes_. Brookfield Homes shall
have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Date, and

after the Effective Date, the business, properties, financial condition or
operations of Brookfield Residential.

Properties, Brookfield Homes or Brookfield Residential may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in Section 10.01, 10.02 or 10.03, as the

failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger,
the Contribution and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
as required by and subject to Section 9.05.

(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Brookfield
Office Properties within 30 calendar days following receipt of written notice
from Brookfield Homes of such breach or failure to perform; or

Brookfield Residential or Brookfield Office Properties (or any of

Agreement pursuant to Section 11.01 or an amendment of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

12.11 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Date until the third anniversary of the
Effective Date, in addition to the actions specifically provided for
elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements and documents contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party hereto shall cooperate with the other parties hereto, and execute
and deliver, or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be executed
and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance,
assignment and transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all
consents, approvals or authorizations of, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person under any Permit or Contract, and to take all such other actions
as such party may reasonably be requested to take by the other party from time
to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to vest
in Brookfield Residential or the Contributed Subsidiaries all of the title
and ownership interest of Brookfield Office Properties and its Subsidiaries to
all of the BPO Residential Assets, to put Brookfield Residential or the
Contributed Subsidiaries in actual possession and operating control thereof
and to permit Brookfield Residential or the Contributed Subsidiaries to
exercise all rights with respect thereto held by the transferor (including,
without limitation, rights with respect to assets as to which the consent of
any Third Party to the transfer thereof shall not have previously been
obtained) and to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and
the other agreements and documents contemplated hereby. In addition,
each party hereto shall execute and deliver, or use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, undertakings
or other documents and take such other actions as such party may reasonably be
requested to be taken by any other party from time to time, consistent with
the terms of this Agreement, in order to have Brookfield Residential or one of
the Contributed Subsidiaries fully assume and discharge the BPO Residential
Liabilities and to release Brookfield Office Properties and its Subsidiaries
from any liability with respect thereto.

(b) For three years following the Effective Date, if Brookfield Office
Properties or Brookfield Residential, as the case may be, identifies any asset
then owned or any liability then assumed by either Brookfield Office
Properties or any of the its Subsidiaries (as constituted after the Effective
Date), on the one hand, or Brookfield Residential or any of the Contributed
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, that both Brookfield Office Properties and
Brookfield Residential each agree in their good faith judgment more properly
belongs to, or should be assumed by, the other party, or a Subsidiary of the
other party, then the Brookfield Office Properties Contributing Corporations
or Brookfield Residential, as the case may be, shall (i) convey, assign,
transfer, contribute and set over any such asset or shall cause any such
asset to be conveyed, assigned, transferred, contributed and set over in
accordance with this Section 12.11 to the entity identified by Brookfield
Office Properties or Brookfield Residential as the appropriate transferee or
(ii) convey, assign, transfer and set over any such liability or shall cause
any such liability to be conveyed, assigned, transferred and set over, and any
such liability shall be assumed in accordance with this Section 12.11 by the
entity identified by Brookfield Office Properties and Brookfield Residential
as the appropriate obligor. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
transfer of assets and liabilities provided for in this Section 12.11(b) are
to be made without any additional consideration other than the assumption of
liabilities of such transferred assets by the transferee.



  

65 (c) All conveyances, assignments, transfers and contributions of assets and
liabilities occurring after the Effective Date pursuant to this Section 12.11
are intended by the parties to relate back to the Effective Time and shall be
governed by the terms of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, any
such conveyances, assignments, transfers and contributions of assets and
liabilities shall be deemed to relate back to the Effective Time and, unless
the parties hereto otherwise agree, shall be made without additional
consideration other than the assumption of liabilities by the transferee.

(d) Whether or not all of the assets or the liabilities described in Section
4.01 shall have been legally transferred to, or assumed by, Brookfield
Residential or one of the Contributed Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date,
the parties hereto agree that as between Brookfield Office Properties and
Brookfield Residential and their respective Subsidiaries, as of the Effective
Date, Brookfield Residential or one of the Contributed Subsidiaries shall
have, and shall be deemed to have acquired, complete and sole beneficial
ownership over all of the BPO Residential Assets, together with all of
Brookfield Office Properties and its Subsidiaries rights, powers and
privileges incident thereto, and shall be deemed to have assumed in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement all of the BPO Residential Liabilities and
all of Brookfield Office Properties and its Subsidiaries duties, obligations
and responsibilities incident thereto. In the event that an asset or liability
of Brookfield Office Properties or its Affiliates that is not a BPO
Residential Asset or BPO Residential Liability is inadvertently transferred to
or assumed by Brookfield Residential or one of the Contributed Subsidiaries,
the parties hereto agree that as between Brookfield Office Properties and
Brookfield Residential and their respective Subsidiaries, as of the Effective
Date, Brookfield Office Properties shall be deemed to have retained complete
and sole beneficial ownership over such non-BPO Residential Asset or non-BPO
Residential Liability, together with all of Brookfield Office Properties and
its Subsidiaries rights, powers and privileges incident thereto, and shall
remain liable for all of Brookfield Office Properties and its Subsidiaries
duties, obligations and responsibilities incident thereto.

(e) With respect to claims, litigation or other proceedings involving one or
more Third Parties, Brookfield Office Properties and Brookfield Residential
shall reasonably cooperate with each other and any applicable insurers at
Brookfield Residentials expense in the prosecution or defense of any such
claim, litigation or other proceeding to the extent arising from the
ownership or conduct of the BPO Residential Businesses prior to the Effective
Time. Brookfield Residential shall bear any insurance retention, deductible
and related expenses. To the extent that any liability or obligation of the
BPO Residential Businesses assumed by Brookfield Residential pursuant to
Section 4.01 exceeding the applicable deductible or self-insured retention
amount may be covered by or reimbursable under any liability or casualty
insurance policy of Brookfield Office Properties or its Subsidiaries
maintained prior to the Effective Time, Brookfield Office Properties will,
upon reasonable request from Brookfield Residential, cooperate with Brookfield
Residential in evaluating the availability of coverage under any such policy

has set forth certain information in its respective disclosure schedule in a
section thereof that corresponds to the Section or portion of a Section of
this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of a
disclosure schedule need not be set forth in any other section of
the disclosure schedule so long as its relevance to such other section of the
disclosure schedule or Section of this Agreement is readily apparent on the
face of the information disclosed in such disclosure schedule. The fact that
any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure schedule shall not be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Any information or the dollar thresholds set forth in a disclosure
schedule shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material,"
"Brookfield Homes Material Adverse Effect" or "Brookfield Office Properties
Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement, except as
