Working Capital Example. If there is an inconsistency between Seller
Accounting Principles and the definitions of Adjusted Aggregate 

      ##### 

  

    

Net Indebtedness, Adjusted Net Working Capital, Seller Outstanding Checks, and
Adjustment Liabilities the terms set forth in such definitions shall control.
If there is an inconsistency between Seller Accounting Principles and the

In the event that Seller disputes the amount of any of the Closing Adjustment Items as set forth in the Closing Date Financial Statements, Seller shall, on or prior to the date that is thirty (30) days following the date on which Purchaser delivers the Closing Date Financial Statements to Seller (the " _Objection Deadline_ "), prepare and deliver to Purchaser a written notice of dispute (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), which Dispute Notice shall (i) identify with reasonable specificity, and provide a reasonably detailed explanation of, the basis upon which Seller has delivered such Dispute Notice, including the applicable provisions of this Agreement on which the dispute set forth in such Dispute Notice is based, and (ii) set forth the amount of each of the Closing Adjustment Items that Seller believes existed as of the Measurement Time, together with supporting documents and information that Seller has utilized in connection with making such determinations and calculations. 

  

 (e) In the event Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof, Purchaser and Seller shall in good faith attempt to reconcile their differences and specify any resolution in writing. Any definitive written resolution by Purchaser and Seller as to any such disputes shall be final, binding and conclusive on all of the Parties. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days after Purchasers receipt of the Dispute Notice from Seller, either Purchaser or Seller may submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to Ernst and Young Global Limited or another independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). Upon the selection of the Independent Accounting Firm, and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days following such selection, Purchaser and Seller shall submit to such Independent Accounting Firm (and the other Party) documentary materials and analyses that Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, believes support its respective position relating to the disputed matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, but excluding any work papers of independent certified public accountants.

In resolving any matter specified in a Dispute Notice, the Independent Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The determinations of the Independent Accounting Firm that are contained in the Final Report shall be final, binding and conclusive on all of the Parties. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by Seller in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by Seller (as 

   ##### 

  

 

finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted, and the balance shall
be paid by Purchaser.

The information contained herein, in the Schedules or delivered to Purchaser or its authorized representatives pursuant hereto and the terms and existence of this Agreement and the status of the Transaction shall be deemed to be Evaluation Material (as defined and subject to the exceptions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement) until the Closing. If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, notwithstanding such termination. 

  

 (c) With respect to any of the representations made by Seller in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ as of the date hereof, in the event that Seller obtains Knowledge of facts and circumstances that arise after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, which would cause one or more of Sellers representations to be materially inaccurate if made as of the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser with information regarding such change in facts and

circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the breach of, or noncompliance
with, the covenants and obligations set forth in this _Section 6.2(c)_ shall
not be considered (i) for purposes of determining whether the condition set
forth in _Section 9.2(a)_ ( _Additional Conditions to Obligations of
Purchaser to Effect the Closing_ ) shall have been satisfied or (ii)
for purposes of _Section 11.2(a)_ ( _Indemnification by Seller_ ). 

   

 Section 6.3 _Efforts and Actions to Cause Closing to Occur_. 

  

 (a) Purchaser, Ralcorp and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities and officials that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully with each other in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals and (iii) provide such other information to any Governmental Entity as such Governmental Entity may reasonably request in connection herewith. Each Party agrees to make as soon as practicable, but no later than twenty (20) days following the date hereof, its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party agrees to make as soon as practicable its respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law. Purchaser shall pay all fees or make other payments to any Governmental Entity in order to obtain any such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of Purchasers undertaking pursuant to  _Section 6.3(a)_, Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to enable the Parties to close the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable (it being understood that the reference to "as promptly as practicable" shall not prejudice Purchaser in negotiating or completing any potential required divestiture or other remedy so long as the Parties are able to complete the Transaction by the Termination Date). For purposes of this _Section 6.3_ , the "reasonable best efforts" of Purchaser shall include Ralcorps and Purchasers agreement to hold separate, divest or license and enter into any arrangements with respect to, such businesses, products and assets of Purchaser or its Affiliates and/or after the Closing, the Company, as may be necessary to obtain the agreement of any Governmental Entity not to seek an injunction against or otherwise oppose the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, on such terms as may be required by such Governmental Entity. The "reasonable best efforts" of Seller and/or the Company shall not require Seller, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to expend any money to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder, to commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding, to offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party or to provide seller financing for the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (c) Neither Purchaser nor Ralcorp shall (and shall not permit any of their Affiliates to) enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction involving any merger or acquisition of shares or assets of any entity engaged in a business which is directly competitive with the Business in the Territory that might reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time required, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, or any other applicable antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law, applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Entities necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) In addition, with respect to matters not otherwise covered by _Section 6.3(b)_ , each of Purchaser and Seller shall, subject to the conditions and upon the terms of this Agreement, use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (e) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Seller shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after becoming aware thereof notify Purchaser in writing of: (i) any notice from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) any Proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Seller or the Company that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to _Section 4.12_ ( _Litigation_ ) or that relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Purchasers receipt of information pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any right of Purchaser under this Agreement, including pursuant to _Article IX_ ( _Conditions_ ), _Article X_ ( _Termination_ ) and _Article XI_ ( _Indemnification_ ), or any representation, warranty or agreement of Seller in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Schedules. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Publicity_. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release, announcement or disclosure concerning the Transaction shall be issued by any Party without the prior consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall prevent (i) any release, announcement or disclosure required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release, announcement or disclosure shall, to the extent practicable, allow the other Parties reasonable time to comment on such release, announcement or disclosure in advance of such issuance, or (ii) any enforcement of rights hereunder. This _Section 6.4_ shall not limit the applicability of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Third Party Consents_. 

  

 (a) The Parties acknowledge that the consent, approval or permission of certain Governmental Entities and other Persons listed in _Schedule 3.4_ may be required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Parties acknowledge that the receipt of such consents, approvals or permissions is not a condition to Closing. To the extent that any of the Contracts or other assets are not saleable, transferable or assignable without the consent of a third party, neither this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements nor any of the instruments or documents executed and delivered in connection herewith or therewith, shall constitute a sale, transfer or assignment thereof if such sale, transfer or assignment or attempted sale, transfer or assignment could constitute a breach, violation or default thereof or could result in the termination of or accelerate the performance required by or result in the right of termination or acceleration thereunder or could result in the creation of an Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on any such Contract. The Parties also agree that, although each of the Parties hereby agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents prior to Closing and the Parties hereby agree to cooperate with each other in attempting to obtain all such consents, any failure to obtain any consent by Seller for any reason in and of itself whatsoever shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement and except as provided in _Section 6.3_ or any Ancillary Agreement, no Party shall be required to pay money to any third party, commence or participate in any litigation, offer or grant any accommodation or undertake any obligation or liability (in each case, financial or otherwise) to any third party (including any Governmental Entity) to obtain such consents, approvals or permissions. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) If one or more consents are not obtained prior to or on the Closing Date and the Closing is consummated, unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, during the six (6) month period after the Closing, Seller agrees to use reasonable best efforts after Closing to assist Purchaser in obtaining any such consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to pay money to any third party (including any Governmental Entity), commence or participate in any litigation, offer or grant any accommodation or undertake any obligation or liability (in each case, financial or otherwise) to any third party (including any Governmental Entity). The Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to allow Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and to the extent reasonably within the contractual or other ability or control of the Parties, to enjoy the economic and other benefits, and to have the economic and other burdens, of the subject matter of the Contract as if such consent had been obtained;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with any such arrangement and (ii) Seller has no obligation to engage in the Business after the Closing. Once a consent for the sale, transfer or assignment of a Contract retained at the Closing is obtained, Seller shall promptly convey, transfer and assign such Contract to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall assume such Contract in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.6 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, during the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to manage all Intercompany Accounts between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company), on the other hand, in the sole discretion of Seller, _provided_ that Seller causes, in a manner in its sole discretion, for all such accounts to be entirely satisfied, retired, repaid, or cancelled effective prior to or as of the Closing. In addition, except as otherwise expressly contemplated in the previous sentence, elsewhere in this Agreement or as set forth on _Schedule 6.6_, Seller shall cause all agreements and commitments, whether written, oral or otherwise, which are solely between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the Company), on the other hand, to be terminated and of no further effect, prior to or as of the Closing. 

  

 Section 6.7 _Bank Accounts_. Seller shall provide Purchaser with a complete list of each of the bank accounts of the Company and the authorized signatories for each such account as soon as reasonably practicable before the Closing Date. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate in connection with the replacement or supplementation of such signatories effective as of the Closing. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate to separate the bank accounts, lock boxes and other cash management arrangements of the Company from the bank accounts, lock boxes and other cash management arrangements of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.8 _Real Estate Matters_. Purchaser, at its own discretion and sole expense, may order preliminary title reports from a nationally recognized title company (the " _Title Companies_ ") with respect to any of the Owned Property. Seller and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts in cooperating with Purchaser and the Title Companies in connection with the compilation, review and examination of title to the Owned Property and in connection with Purchasers efforts to obtain title insurance policies pursuant thereto on behalf of itself and/or its lender, including without limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts (i) to provide customary affidavits, title endorsements and indemnities as are reasonably required by the Title Companies for the deletion of any standard, printed or other exceptions, in any title insurance policies issued pursuant thereto, that are customarily deleted by virtue of a seller delivering such instruments in commercial real estate transactions in the state or province in which the Owned Property, which is the subject of such a title insurance policy, is located ( _provided_ that such affidavits shall be based on the actual knowledge of the signatory and delivered on the Closing Date); (ii) to cause the removal of, including by paying amounts due thereunder, mechanics liens, materialmens liens, judgment liens or similar liens encumbering the Owned Property; (iii) to assist Purchaser in obtaining corrections of record of any defects or errors in the legal descriptions of the Owned Property or the exceptions pertaining thereto; (iv) to deliver to Purchaser copies of any material unrecorded documents referenced in recorded documents affecting the title to the Owned Property; and (v) to obtain from third parties estoppel certificates with respect to title matters reasonably requested by Purchaser. 

  

 Section 6.9 _Shared Contracts_. The Parties acknowledge that certain Sara Lee Entities are parties to certain Contracts that relate to the operations or conduct of the business of one or more of the Sara Lee Entities and the Business, but will remain with the applicable Sara Lee Entities after the Closing. In the case of those Contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.9_ (the " _Shared Contracts_ "), the Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain the agreement of the third party that is the counterparty to each Shared Contract to enter into a new contract effective as of the Closing Date pursuant to which the Company will receive substantially the same goods and services provided by the Shared Contract to the Company, as applicable, prior to the Closing on terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in the Shared Contract as of the Closing Date (each, a " _Replacement Contract_ ") and, where applicable, to cause the applicable counterparty to release Seller and its applicable Affiliates (other than the Company) from any applicable minimum quantity or other commitments to the extent such commitments become the obligation of the Company under the Replacement Contract and (ii) to the extent the Company is a party to a Shared Contract, obtain the release from the counterparty of the Company from obligations arising after the Closing Date under the Shared Contract effective as of the Closing Date. If one or more Replacement Contracts are not obtained prior to or on the Closing Date, unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing, during the remaining term of the applicable Shared Contract, the Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to allow the Company to the extent permitted by applicable Law and to the extent reasonably within the contractual or other ability or control of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, to receive substantially the same goods and services of the subject matter of the Shared Contract received prior to the Closing and the economic and other burdens of such Shared Contract;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any reasonable and documented out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with any such arrangement and (ii) Seller has no obligation to engage in the Business after the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Replacement Contract impose any obligations or liability on Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing. 

  

 Section 6.10 _Insurance Matters_. During the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date, none of Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall make any changes or amendments to the Insurance Policies, other than any changes or amendments made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Seller shall take all necessary actions to (i) maintain coverage for the Company under each of the Insurance Policies in amounts in all material respects 

   ##### 

  

 

consistent with the amounts held as of the date hereof and (ii) renew or
replace such Insurance Policies in the event of their expiration prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_  that any renewals, replacements or amendments shall
be made on terms in all material respects consistent with the terms of the
Insurance Policies. 

   

 Section 6.11 _Substitution of Guarantees_. Purchaser and Seller shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) cause Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof to be substituted for Seller and its Affiliates in those guarantees, letters of comfort, indemnities or similar arrangements entered into by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) in respect of the Business (collectively, the " _Business Guaranties_ ") and (ii) cause Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company) to be fully released, in each case, effective as promptly as practicable, in respect of all obligations of Seller and any Affiliate thereof under all Business Guaranties. If Purchaser is unable to effect such a substitution and release with respect to any Business Guaranty after using reasonable efforts to do so, Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties from any Losses arising from such Business Guaranty. 

  

ARTICLE VII 
 POST-CLOSING COVENANTS 

   

 Section 7.1 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall comply with, or shall cause the Company to comply with, the portion of the Affected Benefit Plans transferred pursuant to this  _Section 7.1_ and assume, or shall cause the Company to assume, all of Sellers and the Companys Liabilities that are attributable to the contributions or contribution histories assumed by Purchaser with respect to Affected Employees and Former Affected Employees relating to the Company Multiemployer Plans and Company Multiemployer Welfare Benefit Plans, regardless of when any such Liability arises or is incurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of employment, including compensation and benefits, applicable to any Affected Employee who is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be governed by the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement and/or the federal labor Law. Purchaser shall be responsible for causing the Company to satisfy all Liabilities related to Affected Employees, Former Affected Employees (but only with respect to the Liabilities specifically assumed by Purchaser under this Section 7.1), Affected Benefit Plans (with respect to the portion thereof transferred pursuant to this _Section 7.1_), and Company Multiemployer Welfare Benefit Plans, whether such Liabilities relate to periods prior to, on or after the Closing Date. With respect to each Company Multiemployer Plan to which contributions are required to be made under a Collective Bargaining Agreement identified on _Schedule 4.18(a)_, or predecessor collective bargaining agreement attributable to the Business: (1) Purchaser agrees that it shall be allocated the contribution histories with respect to (A) Affected Employees and Former Affected Employees of the Company and Seller relating to the Business, and (B) any other individual who performed services for the Company or Seller relating to the Business if for the period during which such individual performed services for the Company or Seller relating to the Business, contributions are or were required to be made with respect to a Company Multiemployer Plan under a Collective Bargaining Agreement identified on _Schedule 4.18(a)_, or predecessor collective bargaining agreement attributable to the Business; and (2) Purchaser covenants that the obligation to contribute the contributions required to be made to any such Multiemployer Plan shall be continued without interruption in the manner required under Section 4218 of ERISA to prevent the occurrence of a "withdrawal" by reason of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to the terms of a Collective Bargaining Agreement, immediately following the Closing Date, and for at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Affiliates to, 

   ##### 

  

 

provide each Affected Employee with at least the same salary and wages, as
were provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that any Affected Employee is entitled to any severance, termination or similar payment, benefit or other obligation under any Benefit Plan or otherwise as a result of the Transaction, Seller shall be responsible for all such payments and benefits and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and the Company from any Liability in respect thereof. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, Purchaser, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall be responsible, if applicable, for severance pay and obligations payable to any Affected Employee whose employment is terminated by Purchaser, or the Company on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ that for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is six (6)-months following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Affiliates to, provide to each such Affected Employee severance benefits that are no less favorable than those for which they are eligible under the applicable Seller severance plan (pursuant to the terms of such severance plan as in effect on the date hereof and disclosed to Purchaser on or prior to the date hereof) in which they are eligible to participate as of the date hereof. Purchaser shall be responsible for all such payments and benefits and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any Liability in respect thereof. 

  

 (d) Seller will have taken all such action prior to the Closing Date as may be required to cause the Affected Employees to cease their participation in, and accrual of benefits under, all Benefit Plans (each such plan, a " _Seller Plan_ ") as of the Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Affiliates to, give each Affected Employee full credit for service with Seller and the Company prior to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, retirement eligibility, seniority, level of benefits, and benefit accrual (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan) under any employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which Affected Employees are eligible to participate (the " _Purchaser Plans_ ") on or after the Closing Date to the same extent recognized by Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_  that in no event shall such service recognition result in any duplication of benefits. 

  

 (e) _Welfare Plans_. 

   

 (i) Seller shall retain the responsibility for payment of all covered medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability claims or expenses incurred by any Affected Employee under any Seller Plan prior to the Closing Date. To the extent an Affected Employee is receiving short-term disability benefits as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume responsibility for such continuing short-term disability benefits; provided, however, that should such Affected Employee become eligible for and entitled to long-term disability benefits pursuant to the long-term disability plan maintained by Seller (assuming, for these purposes, that such Affected Employee had been employed by Seller at the time that the event giving rise to the disability occurred), then Seller shall retain responsibility for providing such Affected Employee with long-term disability benefits. The Seller shall coordinate collection and payment of premiums on behalf of Affected Employees who are on short-term disability and eligible for and paying premiums under the long-term disability plan maintained by Seller for such period as such Affected Employees continue to receive short-term disability benefits following the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a list that sets forth the Affected Employees who are out on short-term disability leave or other leave of absence as of the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) To the extent applicable and permitted under applicable Law, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and its Affiliates to, waive all limitations, as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees (and their eligible dependents) under any Purchaser Plan that is a welfare plan (within the meaning of section 3(1) of ERISA) to the extent such conditions were satisfied under a corresponding Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall provide each Affected Employee (and their eligible dependents) with credit under any Purchaser Plan that is a welfare plan for any co-payments and deductibles paid under a corresponding Benefit Plan in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if later, in the calendar year in which Affected Employees (and their eligible dependents) become eligible to participate in such Purchaser Plan) for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductibles, co-payment or out-of-pocket limits under the corresponding Purchaser Plans. Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser and to use Sellers reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser with obtaining the information necessary for Purchaser to meet its obligations under this subsection (ii). 

   

 (iii) Following the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, retain all obligations to provide continuation health care coverage in accordance with Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") to all Persons who incur or incurred a "qualifying event" in accordance with COBRA at any time under any Seller Benefit Plans. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, provide COBRA coverage to all Affected Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur a "qualifying event" in accordance with COBRA under an employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates at any time on or after the Closing Date. 

   

 (iv) Purchaser shall establish, for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses under a new or existing plan established or maintained under Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (" _Purchaser s FSA_"), effective as of the Closing Date, for each Affected Employee who, on or prior to such date, is a participant in, and maintains a flexible spending account for medical or dependent care expenses under, a Seller Benefit Plan pursuant to Section 125 and Section 129 of the Code (" _Seller s FSA_"). As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall credit the applicable account of each such Affected Employee under Purchasers FSA with an amount equal to the balance of such Affected Employees account under Sellers FSA immediately prior to such date. Purchaser and Seller intend that the actions to be taken pursuant to this subparagraph be treated as an assumption by Purchaser of the portion of Sellers FSA and the elections made thereunder attributable to such Affected Employees. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall determine the Aggregate Balance (as defined below) of the assumed flexible spending accounts and notify Purchaser of the amount of such Aggregate Balance in writing. For purposes of this _Section 7.1(e)(iv)_, the term " _Aggregate Balance_ " shall mean, as of the Closing Date, the aggregate amount of contributions that have been made to the Affected Employees flexible spending accounts under Sellers FSA by Affected Employees for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs minus the aggregate amount of reimbursements that have been made from the Affected Employees flexible spending accounts under Sellers FSA to Affected Employees for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. If the Aggregate Balance is a negative amount, Purchaser shall pay such negative amount to Seller as soon as practicable following Purchasers receipt of the written notice thereof. If the Aggregate Balance is a positive amount, Seller shall pay such positive amount to Purchaser as soon as practicable following Sellers delivery to Purchaser of the written notice thereof. 

   

 (v) Seller currently sponsors the Sara Lee Corporation Retiree Health Benefit Plan under which certain Affected Employees and Former Affected Employees are or may become 

   ##### 

  

   

eligible for retiree welfare benefits (including retiree medical, retiree
prescription drug, retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits) (the "
_Retiree Welfare Benefits_ "). From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
assume all obligations with respect to the Retiree Welfare Benefits in
connection with the Affected Employees and Former Affected Employees and
their dependents currently provided by Seller and its Affiliates under the
Sara Lee Corporation Retiree Health Benefit Plan and Seller and its
Affiliates shall cease to have any responsibility or liability for such
Retiree Welfare Benefits. Except as provided in this _Section 7.1(e)(v)_,
Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all responsibility and liability for
all other retiree welfare obligations under the Sara Lee Corporation Retiree
Health Benefit Plan. 

   

 (vi) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume all obligations of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Company Multiemployer Welfare Benefit Plans, and Seller and its Affiliates shall be relieved of all responsibility for Liabilities. 

   

 (vii) As of the Closing Date, Seller shall take all action necessary to amend any Seller Benefit Plan with respect to medical (including vision and prescription drug, but not flexible spending accounts for medical care), dental, life insurance, and long-term disability insurance coverage for Affected Employees so that such coverage shall continue until December 31, 2011; provided, however, that (1) the cost of such coverage, as well as any administrative expense incurred by the Seller relating to providing such coverage, shall be paid entirely by the Purchaser, to be billed by the Seller to the Purchaser through a mutually agreeable billing process; (2) to the extent such coverage is provided on a fully-insured basis, Sellers obligation under this Section 7.1(e)(vii) to provide such extended coverage shall be subject to and contingent upon the agreement of the applicable insurance carrier to provide such extended coverage; (3) Seller and Sellers Benefit Plans shall not become obligated for any additional continuation of coverage, through COBRA or otherwise, to any Affected Employee after the end of such continuation, and to the extent any Affected Employee or qualified beneficiary incurs what would otherwise be a COBRA qualifying event on or after the Closing Date but on or before December 31, 2011, the Affected Employee or qualified beneficiary shall continue coverage under the Seller Benefit Plan until December 31, 2011 and the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing COBRA coverage to the Affected Employee thereafter. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent there is a conflict between this Section 7.1(e)(vii) and Section 7.1(d) or Section 7.1(e)(ii) of this Agreement, this Section 7.1(e)(vii) shall apply. 

  

 (f) _Defined Contribution Plans_. No assets or liabilities of any Benefit Plan that is intended to be a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) shall be transferred to a retirement plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its affiliates, other than in connection with a rollover of an Affected Employees account balance under the Seller 401(k) Plan. Purchaser or its applicable affiliate shall cause a tax-qualified defined contribution plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Code Section 401(k) established or maintained by Purchaser or such affiliate (" _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") to accept eligible rollover distributions, including any loans, (as defined in Code Section 402) from Affected Employees with respect to Affected Employees account balances under the Sara Lee Corporation 401(k) Plan (" _Seller 401(k) Plan_ "), if properly elected by such Affected Employees in accordance with applicable law and the Seller 401(k) Plan and Purchaser 401(k) Plan. The foregoing provisions are subject to each of Sellers and Purchasers reasonable satisfaction that the Seller 401(k) Plan and the Purchaser 401(k) Plan, as applicable, continues to satisfy the requirements for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and that the trust that forms a part of such plan is exempt from tax under Code Section 501(a). 

  

 (g) _Defined Benefit Plan Transfers_. Purchaser shall not assume, and Seller will not transfer, any assets or Liabilities from the Sara Lee Corporation Consolidated Hourly Pension Plan or the 

   ##### 

  

 

Sara Lee Corporation Salaried Pension Plan (each, a " _Seller Pension Plan_ ")
or any other defined benefit plan that is intended to be a qualified plan
under Code Section 401(a). 

   

 (h) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not assume, and Seller will not transfer, any assets or Liabilities from the Sara Lee Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan or the Sara Lee Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan or any other nonqualified deferred compensation plan (collectively, the " _Seller Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans_ "). 

  

 (i) Purchaser shall recognize and assume all Liability for all vacation, holiday, sick leave, flex days and personal days off, including banked vacation, accrued but not yet used by Affected Employees as of the Closing Date (the " _Days Off Accrual_ "), and shall credit each Affected Employee with such Days Off Accrual. 

  

 (j) Effective as of the Measurement Time, Purchaser shall assume, and none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall have any further Liability for, the following agreements, obligations, and liabilities, and Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and the employees of each, and hold them harmless with respect to such agreements, obligations or liabilities: the agreements entered into between Seller, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and Affected Employees set forth on _Schedule 7.1(j)(i)_; and the collective bargaining agreements applicable to the Affected Employees and Former Affected Employees. 

  

 (k) Seller shall be responsible for all obligations and Liabilities under Sellers equity or equity-based plans in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (l) The Parties hereto agree to, to the extent applicable, (i) treat Purchaser as a "successor employer" and Seller (or the applicable Subsidiary of Seller) as a "predecessor" within the meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code with respect to employees of the Company for purposes of taxes imposed under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act and the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other to avoid the filing of more than one IRS Form W-2 with respect to each such employee for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs by utilizing solely Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, Alternate Procedure for Predecessors and Successors.

 COVENANTS RELATED TO TAX MATTERS 

   

 Section 8.1 _Allocation_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall be liable for and pay any and all Taxes levied or imposed on, or attributable to, the Company for any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending or deemed to end (including under this Agreement), on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable for or pay any Taxes taken into account in the determination of the Final Adjusted Net Working Capital (with the Taxes described in this proviso referred to herein as " _Excluded Taxes_ "). In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a taxable period beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") (including refunds of, or credits attributable to, such Taxes), to the extent permitted or required under applicable law, the portion of such Tax that relates to the period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes imposed upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period up to and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be equal to the amount that would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended as of the Measurement Time. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable period ended as of the Measurement Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Tax items relating to any transactions not in the ordinary course of business that occur after the Measurement Time shall be treated as occurring after the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Purchaser shall be liable for and pay (i) any and all Taxes levied or imposed on, or attributable to, the Company for any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) beginning or deemed to begin (including under this Agreement) after the Closing Date and (ii) any and all Excluded Taxes. 

  

 (c) If, as a result of any Audit, Tax Claim or amended Tax Return, there is any change after the Closing Date in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or amount of Tax that results in an increase in a Tax liability for which Seller would otherwise be liable pursuant to Section 8.1(a) (Allocation) or Article XI (Indemnification), and such change results in or will result in a Tax Benefit to the Company, Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof for any taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date or for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, the amount for which Seller is liable pursuant to paragraph (a) with respect to such increase shall be reduced by the amount of such Tax Benefit (and, to the extent such increase in Tax liability is paid to a taxing authority 

   ##### 

  

 

by Seller or any Affiliate thereof, Purchaser shall pay Seller an amount equal
to the amount of such Tax Benefit). 

   

 Section 8.2 _Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared all income Tax Returns for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_ ") the due date of which is after the Closing Date (such Tax Returns, the " _Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_ ").

Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company for any Straddle Period and any non-income Tax Returns of the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the due date of which is after the Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Returns_ "). All such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns and Purchaser Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company unless otherwise required by a change in applicable Law. Purchaser shall submit each Purchaser Return to Seller at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Purchaser Returns (taking into account any extensions); provided that, if such Purchaser Return is not an income Tax Return (" _Non-Income Purchaser Return_ "), the Purchaser shall deliver such Non-Income Purchaser Return to Seller as soon as practicable on or prior to the due date (taking into account any extensions) for filing such Non-Income Purchaser Return. Seller shall have the right to review, comment, and approve such Purchaser Returns and Purchaser shall reflect such comments from Seller on such Purchaser Returns to the extent such comments are not inconsistent with the standard set forth in the previous sentence; provided that, with respect to any Non-Income Purchaser Return, if the Seller is not able to complete its review and comment prior to the due date (taking into account any extensions) of such Non-Income Purchaser Returns, (1) such Non-Income Tax Return shall be timely filed and, (2) upon resolution of any comments made by Seller, if and to the extent required, such Non-Income Tax Returns shall be amended to reflect such resolution, and (3) the amount of Tax for which Seller is liable under this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted and Seller and Buyer shall make appropriate payments to other party consistent with such adjustment and this Agreement.

Seller, Purchaser and the Company agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations, including the expiration of any loss carry-forwards generated during Pre-Closing Tax Periods (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) unless otherwise consented to in writing by the other parties, Seller, Purchaser or the Company shall not destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any such books and records, or any portions thereof, without first offering to surrender to the other Party such books and records.

Purchaser and/or the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the applicable Governmental Entity that issues any credits that it receives with respect to Taxes relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period, in lieu of such credits, issue a refund. If after using such commercially reasonable efforts, Purchaser and/or the Company are unable to obtain a refund, then Purchaser and/or the Company shall pay to Seller the amount of such credits as such credits are utilized to offset Purchasers and/or the Companys Tax liability.

 Section 11.5 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) In order for a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement, as a result of a Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice thereof to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Section 11.5_ except and only to the extent, if any, that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. 

  

 (b) Except with respect to a Tax Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party, there is 

   ##### 

  

 

an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Party in
connection with such defense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, or then has
the right to assume the defense in accordance with this _Section 11.5(b)_,
the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless a final judgment from
which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is
entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to
retain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim in those instances
where such Indemnified Party has reasonably anticipated potential Losses in
an amount that is materially greater than the remaining amount available
under the Cap; _provided_ that if the Indemnified Party exercises this right,
it shall (x) consult with the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense
of the Third Party Claim and (y) not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section 11.5(b)_ shall not apply
to a Third Party Claim that is a Tax Claim. 

   

 (c) If any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice of such claim promptly to the Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Section 11.5_, except and only to the extent, if any, that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters ( _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to make available any such records, materials or information that is subject to attorney-client or other legal privilege if making available any such records, materials or information would result in a violation or waiver of such privilege), furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with respect to such matters. 

  

 (d) Seller shall control the conduct, through its own counsel at its sole expense and with the participation of Purchaser, of any Audit or court proceeding relating to any Tax Claim involving any asserted Liability with respect or relating solely to any Taxes for which Seller would be liable under this Agreement. Seller shall have all rights to settle, compromise or concede such Tax Claim and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause the Company to reasonably cooperate; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not settle, compromise or concede such Tax Claim in a manner that would adversely affect Purchaser or the Company without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (e) Subject to _Section 8.5_ ( _Filing and Amending Tax Returns_ ) and  _Section 11.5(f)_ ( _Indemnification Procedures_ ), Purchaser shall control the conduct, through its own counsel at its sole expense, of any Audit or court proceeding relating to any Tax Claim involving any asserted Liability with 

   ##### 

  

 

respect or relating, in whole or in part, to Taxes for which Purchaser would
be liable under this Agreement, provided, that if such Tax Claim involves any
asserted Liability with respect or relating to Taxes for which Seller would
be liable under this Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to jointly control
such Audit or court proceeding. Subject to _Section 8.5_ ( _Filing
and Amending Tax Returns_ ) and _Section 11.5(f)_ ( _Indemnification
Procedures_ ), Purchaser shall have all rights to settle, compromise or
concede any such Tax Claim and Seller shall reasonably cooperate; _provided_
, _however_ , that Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or concede any Tax
Claim involving any asserted Liability for Taxes for which Seller would be
liable under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 (f) With respect to any Audit or court proceeding relating to any Tax Claim involving any asserted Liability with respect to or relating to any Straddle Period that involves Taxes for which both Purchaser and Seller would be liable under this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly control the conduct of any such Audit or court proceeding, through counsel of their own choosing and expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Purchaser nor Seller shall settle, compromise or concede such Tax Claim in a manner that would adversely affect the other Party without the prior written consent of such Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (g) Any Remedial Action that is the subject of any indemnity claim under this Agreement shall be performed in accordance with methods reasonably estimated to meet minimum applicable cleanup standards in a manner which mitigates costs (from the perspective of a reasonable business person acting without regard to the availability of indemnification hereunder) for performing a particular Remedial Action, it being understood that such methods shall include, where applicable, risk-based remedies or remedial standards, institutional or engineering controls or deed restrictions on real property, where such standards, controls or restrictions would not unreasonably interfere with ongoing industrial operations at the relevant property, 

  

 Section 11.6 _Limits on Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) No claim may be asserted against either Party for breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, unless written notice of such claim is received by such Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim on or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section 11.1_ ( _Survival_ ), in which case such representation, warranty or covenant shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from Seller by all Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ and Section 11.2(d) ( _Indemnification by Seller_ ) shall be U.S.$54,500,000 (the " _Cap_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to indemnifiable Losses incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party that arise from (A) a breach or inaccuracy of a Core Representation or (B) fraud of Seller (to the extent determined by a final judgment not subject to appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction) (such Losses as set forth in  _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , " _Seller Special Losses_ "). The maximum aggregate liability of Seller for any indemnification claims (arising from Seller Special Losses or otherwise) under this _Section 11.6_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price;  _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no maximum liability for Losses incurred as a result of fraud of Seller (to the extent determined by a final judgment not subject to appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction); 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) Seller shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ ( _Indemnification by Seller_ ) unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from Seller (including, without limitation, all Losses that may be recovered from Seller pursuant to  _Section 11.2(d)_), equals or exceeds U.S.$5,450,000 (the " _Deductible Amount_ "), in which case Seller shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event no Losses may be claimed by any Purchaser Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by Seller or shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses for purposes of this _clause (ii)_ other than Losses in excess of (A) U.S.$250,000 in respect of any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)_ ( _Indemnification by Seller_ ) as a result of the breach of  _Section 4.12_ ( _Litigation_ ) or (B) U.S.$100,000 (the " _Minimum Loss Amount_ ") in all other cases, in each case, resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Deductible Amount nor the Minimum Loss Amount shall apply as a threshold to any indemnification claims for Seller Special Losses or for any Losses described in _Section 11.4_ ( _Indemnification for Taxes_ ); 

   

 (iii) Seller shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.2(d)_ ( _Indemnification by Seller_ ) unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from Seller equals or exceeds U.S.$1,000,000, in which case Seller shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of U.S.$1,000,000; 

   

 (iv) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from Purchaser by all Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ ( _Indemnification by Purchaser_ ) shall be the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to indemnifiable Losses incurred by a Seller Indemnified Party that arise from (A) a breach or inaccuracy of _Section 5.1_ ( _Organization_ ), _Section 5.2_ ( _Authorization_ ), _Section 5.3_ ( _Execution; Validity of Agreement_ ), or  _Section 5.7_ ( _Brokers or Finders_ ) or (B) fraud of Purchaser (to the extent determined by a final judgment not subject to appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction) (such Losses as set forth in _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , " _Purchaser Special Losses_ "). The maximum aggregate liability of Purchaser for any indemnification claims (arising from Purchaser Special Losses or otherwise) under this _Section 11.6_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price, _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no maximum liability for Losses incurred as a result of fraud of Purchaser (to the extent determined by a final judgment not subject to appeal by a court of competent jurisdiction); 

   

 (v) Purchaser shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnified Party for any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ ( _Indemnification by Purchaser_ ) unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from Purchaser equals or exceeds the Deductible Amount, in which case Purchaser shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event no Losses for a claim under _Section 11.3(a)_ ( _Indemnification by Purchaser_ ) may be claimed by any Seller Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by Purchaser or shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses for purposes of this _clause (iv)_ other than Losses in excess of the Minimum Loss Amount resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Deductible Amount nor the Minimum Loss Amount shall apply as a threshold to any indemnification claims for Purchaser Special Losses or for Losses described in _Section 11.4(a)(ii)_; 

   

 (vi) no Party shall have any Liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue whether or not expected, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or 

   ##### 

  

   

opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, except
to the extent that such damages are specifically included in Third Party
Claims and result in Losses; and 

   

 (vii) any claim for indemnification under this _Section 11.6_ by any Party shall be bona fide and made in good faith. 

  

 (c) For all purposes of this _Section 11.6_ (and for the avoidance of doubt, for all purposes of _Section 11.4_ ( _Indemnification for Taxes_ )), "Losses" shall be net of any (i) insurance or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification and (ii) any Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification. 

  

 (d) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim, liability or Loss for which indemnification may be required hereunder, including by making, or causing the applicable Indemnified Party to make, all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such claim, liability or Loss. If Purchaser or Seller shall fail to make such commercially reasonable efforts, then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other Party shall not be required to indemnify any Person for any claim, liability or Loss that would reasonably be expected to have been avoided if such efforts had been made. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller shall, or shall cause the applicable Indemnified Party to, use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall not have any right to indemnification under _Article XI_ or otherwise under this Agreement to the extent such Losses and/or Taxes (i) are attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) are due to the unavailability in any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date or (iii) Excluded Taxes. 

  

 Section 11.7 _Assignment of Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives any payment from any Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to this _Section 11.7_ and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign, on a non-recourse basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. If any such assignment would afford the Potential Contributor any defense to the payment of the same, such assignment shall not take place and the Indemnified Party will, at the Indemnifying Partys direction and expense, take all reasonable actions to seek to recover such claim from such Potential Contributor. Any payment received in respect of such claim against the Potential Contributor (whether by the Indemnifying Party or the relevant Indemnified Party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence) shall be distributed, (i) _first_ , to the Indemnifying Party in an amount equal to the aggregate payments made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, plus the costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such claim, (ii) _second_ , to the Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or similar amount required to be paid by the Indemnified Party prior to the Indemnifying Party being required to make any payment to the Indemnified Party plus, in the case of any claim by the Indemnified Party as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the costs and expenses incurred in investigating, prosecuting, defending or otherwise addressing such claim, and (iii) _third_ , the balance, if any, to the Indemnified Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 11.8 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnity payments made pursuant to this _Article XI_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the consideration paid with respect to the Securities. 

  

 Section 11.9 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_. 

  

 (a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or by reason of a Party receiving an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.6_ ( _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ) in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification. 

  

 (b) From and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of each Party in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction (whether under this Agreement or arising under common law or any other Law, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended from time to time, or any other Environmental Laws) shall be as provided in this _Article XI_, except as otherwise specified in _Section 2.6_ ( _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ) and _Section 12.16_ ( _Remedies_ ) and except for common law fraud claims. 

  

 Section 11.10 _Indemnification for Assumed Business Liabilities_. Purchaser shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses to the extent resulting from any Assumed Business Liabilities, and such obligation to save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless shall survive until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date (it being understood and agreed that if a claim is made by a Seller Indemnified Party under this  _Section 11.10_ prior to such sixth (6th) anniversary, the obligation of Purchaser to indemnify with respect to such claim shall continue until such claim is resolved and any amounts with respect to such claim are paid); provided that: 

  

 (a) no indemnification shall be available for Liabilities that, if asserted against or suffered by the Company, would be subject to indemnification under _Section 11.2_ ( _Indemnification by Seller_ ); provided that solely for the purpose of this _Section 11.10_, the survival period specified in _Section 11.1(a)_ shall be extended from eighteen (18) months to thirty (30) months and the survival period specified in _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_ shall be extended from five (5) years to six (6) years; and 

  

 (b) if and to the extent Purchaser indemnifies Seller Indemnified Parties under this _Section 11.10_ in respect of any Liability that if asserted against or suffered by the Company would represent a breach of the representations and warranties provided in _Article III_ ( _Representation and Warranties as to Organization, Authorization, Execution and Consents_ ) or _Article IV_ ( _Representation and Warranties as to the Company_ ), the amount of such indemnification shall count towards the Deductible Amount. 

  

 Section 11.11 _Limitation on Set-off_. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have any right to set-off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XI_ against any payment due pursuant to _Article II_ ( _Purchase and Sale_ ) or under any other agreement. 

  

 Section 11.12 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date: 

  

 (a) At the request of Purchaser, and at Purchasers expense, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with, and use reasonable best efforts to assist, Purchaser in recovering under the third party insurance policies of Seller (other than self-insurance policies) for claims with respect to the Business existing or arising from any past acts or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or 

   ##### 

  

 

to have failed to occur (including loss under property insurance coverage)
prior to the Closing or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed
prior to the Closing; and 

   

 (b) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, subject to the terms of such insurance policies of Seller, to preserve and retain the right to make claims and receive recoveries under such insurance policies of Seller for the benefit of the Company under any such insurance policy of Seller maintained as of the date hereof by either Seller or its Affiliates covering any loss, liability, damage or expense (to the full extent of the existing coverage) relating to the assets, business, operations, conduct, products and employees of the Business that relates to or arises out of occurrences prior to the Closing.

With respect to the Ralcorp Guaranty, the Person whose payment or performance is covered by such Ralcorp Guaranty is referred to herein as the "Ralcorp Guaranteed Person", the Persons entitled to the benefit of a Ralcorp Guaranty are collectively referred to herein as the "Beneficiary", and the obligations guaranteed by such Ralcorp Guaranty are collectively referred to herein as the "Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligations." 

  

 (b) A demand for payment or performance or an action to enforce the Ralcorp Guaranty may be made, brought or prosecuted, as applicable, against Ralcorp only if a Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligation remains unpaid or unperformed for any reason five (5) Business Days after Seller has made a written demand for payment or performance against a Ralcorp Guaranteed Person with respect to such Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligation. 

  

 Section 12.2 _Absolute and Unconditional Guaranty_. The Liability of Ralcorp under its Ralcorp Guaranty shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, be absolute and, except as set forth in _Section 12.1(b)_ ( _Guaranty of Ralcorp_ ) and the last paragraph of this  _Section 12.2_, unconditional irrespective of: 

  

 (a) the illegality of the Ralcorp Guaranty; 

  

 (b) the validity or genuineness of this Agreement with respect to the Ralcorp Guaranteed Person; 

  

 (c) the enforceability of this _Article XII_ against the Ralcorp Guaranteed Person and Ralcorp; 

  

 (d) any release or discharge of any obligation of the Ralcorp Guaranteed Person under this Agreement resulting from any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Ralcorp Guaranteed Person, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Ralcorp Guaranteed Person or any of its assets; 

  

 (e) any amendment or modification of this Agreement, or change in the manner, place or terms of payment or performance, or any change or extension of the time of payment or performance of, renewal or alteration of, any Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligation, any escrow arrangement or

departure from the terms of this Agreement or the documents entered into in

 Section 12.3 _Beneficiaries_. No Beneficiary shall be obligated to file any claim relating to any Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligation in the event that the Ralcorp Guaranteed Person becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Beneficiary to so file shall not affect Ralcorps obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Beneficiary in respect of any Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, Ralcorp shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made. 

  

 Section 12.4 _Waivers_. Ralcorp irrevocably waives acceptance, presentment, demand, protest and any notice in respect of the Ralcorp Guaranty not provided for herein. 

  

 Section 12.5 _Subrogation_. Ralcorp may not exercise any rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising by contract or operation of Law (including any such right arising under bankruptcy or insolvency Laws) or otherwise, by reason of any payment by it in respect of the Ralcorp Guaranty unless and until all of the Ralcorp Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full.

Matters reflected in any Section of this Agreement, including any Schedule, are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in any Section of this Agreement, including any Schedule shall be construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or order by a Governmental Entity shall be construed as an admission or indication that any breach or violation exists or actually occurred.

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of such Party. The failure of either Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
