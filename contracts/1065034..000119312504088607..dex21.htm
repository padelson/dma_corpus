Number. The amount of cash each Company Stockholder is entitled to receive
for the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder shall
be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for
all shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder. The
preceding provisions of this _Section 2.4(b)(iii)_ are subject to the
provisions of _Section 2.4(b)(v)_ (regarding the delivery of cash in lieu of
any fractional shares), _Section 2.4(c)_ (regarding rights of holders of
Dissenting Shares), _Section 2.4(e)_ (regarding the continuation of vesting
and repurchase rights), _Section 2.7_ (regarding the withholding of General
Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash) and _Section 2.8_  (regarding the
withholding of IP Escrow Shares and IP Escrow Cash).



(iv) _Earnout_. In addition to the Initial Stock Consideration and Initial
Cash Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(iii)_ , upon the
Surviving Corporations completion of product development and achievement of
product bookings (and subject to the timely achievement of certain technical
milestones), Acquiror shall distribute additional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock and cash to the former Company Stockholders, all in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in _Article 3_. Subject to the provisions of
_Article 3_ , the portion of the additional shares of Acquiror Common Stock
and cash received by each Company Stockholder will be in proportion to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger.



(v) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be
issued in connection with the First Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder
of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Acquiror Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares
of Acquiror Common Stock to be received by such holder at that time) will
receive from Acquiror an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the Closing Stock Price multiplied by the fraction of a share of
Acquiror Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The
parties acknowledge that any payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares provided for herein was not separately bargained for
consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares.



 

12 (c) _Dissenting Shares_. If, in connection with the First Merger, holders of
Company Capital Stock are entitled to appraisal rights pursuant to Delaware
Law, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive
shares of Acquiror Common Stock and cash as provided in _Section 2.4(b)_ , but
shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Delaware Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions
of Delaware Law, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares
shall receive payment therefor in accordance with Delaware Law (but only after
the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant
to Delaware Law). In the event that any Company Stockholder fails to make an
effective demand for payment or fails to perfect its appraisal rights as to
its shares of Company Capital Stock or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise
lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall
immediately be converted into the right to receive the consideration issuable
pursuant to _Article 2_ and _Article 3_ in respect of such shares as if such
shares had never been Dissenting Shares, and Acquiror shall issue and deliver
to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after)
the applicable time or times specified in _Section 2.9_ , following the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 2.9_ , the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock and cash, without interest thereon, to which
such Company Stockholder would have been entitled under _Section 2.4(b)_ with
respect to such shares, subject to the provisions of _Section 2.4(b)(v)_
(regarding the delivery of cash in lieu of any fractional shares), _Section
2.4(e)_ (regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase rights),
_Section 2.7_ (regarding the withholding of General Escrow Shares and General
Escrow Cash) and _Section 2.8_ (regarding the withholding of IP Escrow Shares
and IP Escrow Cash). The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice (and in no
event more than two business days) of any demand received by the Company for
appraisal of Company Capital Stock or notice of exercise of a Company
Stockholders appraisal rights, and Acquiror shall have the right to control
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company
agrees that, except with Acquirors prior written consent, it shall
not voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for appraisal.



(d) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.4(b)_ ,
each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the First Merger shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.



(e) _Continuation of Vesting and Repurchase Rights_.



(i) _Unvested Acquiror Shares_. The repurchase option, vesting schedule or
other condition applicable to any Unvested Company Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assigned to
Acquiror and shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such
Unvested Company Shares in the First Merger (the "Unvested Acquiror Shares")
shall be withheld by Acquiror (subject to repurchase by Acquiror on the same
terms as governed such Unvested Company Shares prior to the First Merger) and
released to the holders of such Unvested Company Shares upon the vesting of
the Unvested Acquiror Shares (assuming vesting by virtue of continuous service
to the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror or by acceleration pursuant to the
terms of the applicable Employment Offer Letter). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder paid for Unvested Company Shares with promissory
notes, Unvested Acquiror Shares which vest shall not be released to such
holder until after repayment of accrued interest and then outstanding
principal under such  



 

13  promissory notes. Cash dividends on Unvested Acquiror Shares will be
distributed to the holders on whose behalf the Unvested Acquiror Shares are
being held by Acquiror. Any shares of Acquiror Common Stock or other equity
securities issued or distributed by Acquiror, including shares issued upon a
stock dividend or split, in respect of Unvested Acquiror Shares (which remain
subject to a repurchase option, vesting schedule or other condition at the
time of such distribution) will be subject to the same repurchase option,
vesting schedule or other condition as the Unvested Acquiror Shares with
respect which the distribution is made. Each holder will have voting rights
with respect to Unvested Acquiror Shares (and other voting securities) held by
Acquiror on its behalf. The Company shall take all actions that may be
necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Acquiror (or its
assignee) is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option, vesting schedule
or other condition, such that upon termination of service, any Unvested
Acquiror Shares shall be forfeited to the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror
without compensation to such holder (other than payment of the original
purchase price of any Unvested Company Shares converted into Unvested Acquiror
Shares upon repurchase by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation according to
the repurchase terms governing such Unvested Company Shares as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger, as same may be modified by
any acceleration provisions in the applicable Employment Offer Letter). No
Unvested Acquiror Shares may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by a former holder
of Unvested Company Shares or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of such holder, prior
to the distribution to such holder of such Unvested Acquiror Shares in
accordance with this Agreement.



(ii) _Unvested Acquiror Cash_. The repurchase option, vesting schedule or
other condition applicable to any Unvested Company Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assigned to
Acquiror and the cash payable upon conversion of such Unvested Company Shares
in the First Merger (the "Unvested Acquiror Cash") shall be withheld by
Acquiror and paid without interest to the holders of such Unvested Company
Shares upon the vesting of the Unvested Cash (assuming vesting by virtue of
continuous service to the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror or by acceleration
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Employment Offer Letter); _provided_
, _however_ , that a portion of such newly vested cash so distributed shall be
treated as imputed interest to the extent required under the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder paid for Unvested Company Shares with promissory notes, Unvested
Acquiror Cash which vests shall not be released to such holder until after
repayment of accrued interest and then outstanding principal under such
promissory notes. The Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Acquiror (or its assignee) is
entitled to exercise any such repurchase option, vesting schedule or other
condition, such that upon termination of service, any Unvested Cash shall be
forfeited to the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror without compensation to
such holder (other than payment of the original purchase price of any
Unvested Company Shares converted into Unvested Acquiror Cash upon repurchase
by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation according to the repurchase terms
governing such Unvested Company Shares as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger, as same may be modified by any
acceleration provisions in the applicable Employment Offer Letter). No
Unvested Acquiror Cash may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by a former
holder of Unvested Company Shares or be taken or reached by any legal or
equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability  



 

14  of such holder, prior to the distribution to such holder of such Unvested
Acquiror Cash in accordance with this Agreement.



2.5 _Treatment of Shares in Second Merger_.



(a) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time of the
Second Merger, each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Second Merger shall
be shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 



(b) _Auto Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time of the Second
Merger, each share of Auto Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Second Merger will
constitute one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common
Stock of the Surviving Corporation. Such shares of Common Stock shall be the
only shares of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time of the Second Merger.



2.6 _Company Options and Other Rights Not Assumed_. Acquiror is not assuming,
and shall not assume, any obligations or Liabilities under (a) the Company
Option Plan, (b) any outstanding Company Options, or (c) any other direct or
indirect rights to acquire shares of Company Capital Stock. On the Closing
Date, the Company Option Plan, any Company Options that have not been
exercised in the manner contemplated by _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_ , and any other
direct or indirect rights to acquire shares of Company Capital Stock shall be
terminated without further obligation or Liability of the Company, Acquiror
or the Surviving Corporation. Acquiror shall not substitute any equivalent
option or right for any such terminated Company Option or right.



2.7 _General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash_.



(a) _General Escrow Shares_. At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall withhold
the General Escrow Shares from the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ to the Company Stockholders as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of solely shares of Company
Capital Stock which constitute and remain Dissenting Shares) ("Effective Time
Holders"), on a pro rata basis based upon the number of shares and amount of
cash each such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.4(b)(iii)_ with respect to its shares of Company Capital Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares) relative to the number of shares and amount of
cash all such holders are entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
2.4(b)(iii)_ with respect to their shares of Company Capital Stock (other
than Dissenting Shares) ("Pro Rata Share"). If a Company Stockholder holds
Unvested Company Shares, then the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued
upon conversion hereunder of shares of Company Capital Stock held by such
Company Stockholder which are not Unvested Company Shares (the "Vested
Acquiror Shares") shall be withheld first and, thereafter, the Unvested
Acquiror Shares shall be withheld (with the understanding that any Unvested
Acquiror Shares so withheld shall vest prior to any such Unvested Acquiror
Shares not withheld by Acquiror pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)(i)_ ) to the
extent necessary to satisfy such Effective Time Holders escrow obligations
as set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 2.7(a)_. The payment of
any General Escrow Shares in satisfaction of any indemnification obligations
under _Article 12_ shall be made, with respect to each Effective  



 

15  Time Holder, first with Vested Acquiror Shares and then, if such shares are
insufficient to satisfy such indemnification obligation and only to the extent
of such insufficiency, shall such payment be made with Unvested Acquiror
Shares. Acquiror shall hold the General Escrow Shares for one year following
the Effective Time of the First Merger (the "General Escrow Period") as
security for the Effective Time Holders indemnification obligations for
Damages under _Article 12_.



(b) _General Escrow Cash_. At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall withhold the
General Escrow Cash from the cash payable pursuant to  _Section 2.4(b)_ to
the Effective Time Holders, on a pro rata basis based upon their respective
Pro Rata Shares. If a Company Stockholder holds Unvested Company Shares, then
the cash to be paid upon conversion hereunder of shares of Company Capital
Stock held by such Company Stockholder which are not Unvested Company Shares
(the "Vested Acquiror Cash") shall be withheld first and, thereafter, the
Unvested Acquiror Cash shall be withheld (with the understanding that
any Unvested Acquiror Cash so withheld shall vest prior to any such Unvested
Acquiror Cash not withheld by Acquiror pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)(ii)_ ) to
the extent necessary to satisfy such Effective Time Holders escrow
obligations as set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 2.7(b)_. The
payment of any General Escrow Cash in satisfaction of any indemnification
obligations under _Article 12_ shall be made, with respect to each Effective
Time Holder, first with Vested Acquiror Cash and then, if such cash is
insufficient to satisfy such indemnification obligation and only to the extent
of such insufficiency, shall such payment be made with Unvested Acquiror Cash.
Acquiror shall hold the General Escrow Cash for the General Escrow Period as
security for the Effective Time Holders indemnification obligations for
Damages under _Article 12_.



(c) _Distributions on General Escrow Shares_. Any dividends or distributions
payable in shares of Acquiror Common Stock or other equity securities or
issued upon a stock split made in respect of any General Escrow Shares shall
be considered General Escrow Shares hereunder. Cash dividends and any other
dividends or distributions in kind on the General Escrow Shares ("General
Escrow Dividends") shall be distributed to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares set forth in the Spreadsheet
within ten business days following the expiration of the General
Escrow Period. Acquiror shall exercise reasonable care in holding and
safeguarding the General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Dividends.



(d) _Voting of General Escrow Shares_. The Effective Time Holders on whose
behalf General Escrow Shares are held by Acquiror shall be entitled to vote
such shares. Acquiror need not forward proxy information, annual or other
reports or other information with respect to the General Escrow Shares to the
Effective Time Holders to the extent such documents or materials are
otherwise furnished by Acquiror with respect to other shares of Acquiror
Common Stock distributed to such holders pursuant to this Agreement.



(e) _Deposit of General Escrow Cash_. As soon as reasonably practicable (but
in any event within 10 business days) following the Spreadsheet Submission
Date, Acquiror shall cause the General Escrow Cash to be deposited in a
segregated interest-bearing account of Acquiror at a bank of its selection
with assets of at least $100,000,000. The interest, earnings and income
that accrues upon the General Escrow Cash during the period of time during
which the General Escrow Cash is held in such account (the "General Escrow
Earnings") shall not be  



 

16  deemed to be part of the General Escrow Cash, but instead shall be held in
the such account for the benefit of the Effective Time Holders and 65% of
such General Escrow Earnings shall be distributed to the Effective Time
Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares set forth in the
Spreadsheet as soon as reasonably practicable following the expiration of the
General Escrow Period (but in any event within 10 ten business days
thereafter). The General Escrow Cash and General Escrow Earnings shall be
initially invested by Acquiror in a U.S. Treasury money market fund and in
such other securities as may be directed in writing by both Acquiror and the
Representative. For tax reporting purposes, all General Escrow Cash, and all
General Escrow Earnings, if any, attributable to the General Escrow Cash,
shall be allocable to Acquiror unless and until the General Escrow Cash
and/or General Escrow Earnings have been distributed to the Effective Time
Holders in accordance with this Agreement. Acquiror shall exercise reasonable
care in investing, holding and safeguarding the General Escrow Cash and the
General Escrow Earnings. 



(f) _Release of General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash_. As soon as
reasonably practicable (but in any event within 10 business days) following
the expiration of the General Escrow Period, Acquiror shall release to the
Effective Time Holders, at their respective addresses and in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Shares, the General Escrow Dividends and General
Escrow Earnings, and all of the remaining General Escrow Shares and General
Escrow Cash, if any, in excess of (i) any General Escrow Shares and General
Escrow Cash retained by Acquiror in satisfaction of Claims (as defined in
_Article 12_ ) for Damages (as defined in _Article 12_ ) by Acquiror
Indemnified Persons (as defined in _Article 12_ ) and (ii) any amount of
General Escrow Shares or General Escrow Cash that is necessary to satisfy all
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims for Damages specified in any Notice
of Claim (as defined in _Article 12_ ) delivered to the Representative before
the expiration of the General Escrow Period. If any Claims are unresolved,
unsatisfied or disputed as of the expiration of the General Escrow Period,
then Acquiror shall retain possession and custody of that amount of General
Escrow Shares (which shall be deemed to have a per share value equal to the
Closing Stock Price) and General Escrow Cash that equals the total maximum
amount of Damages then being claimed by Acquiror Indemnified Persons in all
such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims, and as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in any event within 10 business days) following resolution of
all such Claims, Acquiror shall release to the Effective Time Holders, at
their respective addresses and in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares of the General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash, all remaining
General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash, if any, not required to satisfy
such Claims (provided that any such remaining General Escrow Shares which are
Unvested Acquiror Shares and any such remaining General Escrow Cash which is
Unvested Acquiror Cash shall nevertheless be withheld by Acquiror and released
in the manner set forth in _Section 2.4(e)_ ). Such releases of General Escrow
Cash, cash General Escrow Dividends and General Escrow Earnings shall be made
by check. If the number of General Escrow Shares to be distributed to any
Effective Time Holder is not evenly divisible by one, Acquiror shall round
down the number of shares to be distributed to the nearest whole share. In
lieu of the fractional interest not distributed, Acquiror shall distribute to
such Effective Time Holder cash in an amount (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the product of (i) such fractional interest and (ii) the
Closing Stock Price. Acquiror shall be deemed to have purchased all such
fractional interests which it has distributed cash in lieu of (rounded down to
the nearest whole share after aggregating all such fractional interests).



 

17 (g) _No Transfer or Encumbrance_. No General Escrow Shares, General
Escrow Dividends, General Escrow Cash, General Escrow Earnings or any
beneficial interest therein may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by Acquiror or an
Effective Time Holder or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of Acquiror or such
Effective Time Holder or used for any reason, prior to (i) in the case of
Acquiror, the retention of General Escrow Shares or General Escrow Cash in
satisfaction of a resolved Claim for Damages in accordance with this Agreement
or (ii) in the case of the Effective Time Holders, the release by Acquiror to
the Effective Time Holders of General Escrow Shares, General Escrow
Dividends, General Escrow Cash or General Escrow Earnings in accordance with
this Agreement, except that Effective Time Holders shall be entitled to assign
their rights to the General Escrow Shares, General Escrow Cash, General Escrow
Dividends or General Escrow Earnings by will, by the laws of intestacy or by
other operation of law.



(h) _No Liability of Acquiror_. In holding and administering the General
Escrow Shares, General Escrow Cash, General Escrow Dividends and General
Escrow Earnings, Acquiror will incur no liability with respect to any action
taken by it in reliance upon any written notice, direction, instruction,
consent, statement or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed by the Representative (and shall have no responsibility to
determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction,
except Acquirors own willful misconduct or gross negligence. In all questions
arising under this Agreement with respect to the General Escrow Shares,
General Escrow Cash, General Escrow Dividends and General Escrow Earnings,
Acquiror may rely on the advice of counsel, and Acquiror will not be liable to
anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by Acquiror based
on such advice, except for Acquirors own willful misconduct or gross
negligence.



2.8 _IP Escrow Shares and IP Escrow Cash_.



(a) _IP Escrow Shares_. At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall withhold the IP
Escrow Shares (described in clause (A) of the definition thereof) from the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ to the
Effective Time Holders, on a pro rata basis based on their respective Pro Rata
Shares. At the First Booking Earnout Distribution Date, Acquiror shall
withhold the IP Escrow Shares (described in clause (B) of the definition
thereof) from the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to

Company Shares, then Vested Acquiror Shares shall be withheld first and,
thereafter, the Unvested Acquiror Shares shall be withheld (with the
understanding that (i) any Unvested Acquiror Shares so withheld shall vest
prior to any such Unvested Acquiror Shares not withheld by Acquiror pursuant
to _Section 2.4(e)(i)_ and (ii) Unvested Acquiror Shares which are IP Escrow
Shares shall vest before Unvested Acquiror Shares which are General Escrow
Shares) to the extent necessary to satisfy such Effective Time Holders escrow
obligations as set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 2.8(a)_. The
payment of any IP Escrow Shares in satisfaction of any indemnification
obligations under _Article 12_ shall be made, with respect to each Effective
Time Holder, first with Vested Acquiror Shares and then, if such shares are
insufficient to satisfy such indemnification obligation and only to
the extent of such insufficiency, shall such payment be made with Unvested
Acquiror Shares. Acquiror shall hold the IP Escrow Shares for three years
following the Effective Time of the First Merger (the "IP  



 

18  Escrow Period") as security for the Effective Time Holders indemnification
obligations for Damages under _Article 12_ arising from assessments, claims,
demands, assertions of liability, or actual or threatened actions, suits or
proceedings (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative)
directly or indirectly arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company in _Section
4.13_ (Intellectual Property) or the disclosures in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Disclosure Letter Update (including all schedules to such letter
or update) related to _Section 4.13_ (Intellectual Property) (where the
relevance to _Section 4.13_ (Intellectual Property) is reasonably apparent
from the face of the disclosures) to be true and correct as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (as though such representation or
warranty were made as of the Closing Date, except in the case of
representations and warranties which by their terms speak only as of a
specific date or dates) ("IP Damages").

prior to any such Unvested Acquiror Cash not withheld by Acquiror pursuant to
_Section 2.1(e)(ii)_ and (ii) Unvested Acquiror Cash which is IP Escrow Cash

shall such payment be made with Unvested Acquiror Cash. Acquiror shall hold
the IP Escrow Cash for the IP Escrow Period as security for the Effective Time
Holders indemnification obligations for IP Damages under  _Article 12_.



(c) _Distributions on IP Escrow Shares_. Any dividends or distributions
payable in shares of Acquiror Common Stock or other equity securities or
issued upon a stock split made in respect of any IP Escrow Shares shall be
considered IP Escrow Shares hereunder. Cash dividends and any other dividends
or distributions in kind on the IP Escrow Shares ("IP Escrow Dividends") shall

Time Holders to the extent such documents or materials are  



 

19  otherwise furnished by Acquiror with respect to other shares of Acquiror
Common Stock distributed to such holders pursuant to this Agreement.

any event within 10 business days) following the Spreadsheet Submission Date,

income that accrues upon the IP Escrow Cash during the period of time during
which the IP Escrow Cash is held in such account (the "IP Escrow Earnings")
shall not be deemed to be part of the IP Escrow Cash, but instead shall be
held in such account for the benefit of the Effective Time Holders and 65% of
such IP Escrow Earnings shall be distributed to the Effective Time Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares set forth in the Spreadsheet

unsatisfied or disputed as of the expiration of the IP Escrow Period, then
Acquiror shall retain possession and custody of that amount of IP Escrow
Shares (which shall be deemed to have a per share value equal to the weighted
average of the Closing Stock Price and the First Booking Stock Price) and IP

Acquiror shall distribute to such Effective Time Holder cash in an amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fractional interest and (ii) the weighted average of the Closing Stock Price
and the First Booking Stock Price. Acquiror shall be deemed to have purchased
all such fractional interests which it has distributed cash in lieu
of (rounded down to the nearest whole share after aggregating all such
fractional interests).



(g) _No Transfer or Encumbrance_. No IP Escrow Shares, IP Escrow Dividends, IP
Escrow Cash, IP Escrow Earnings or any beneficial interest therein may be
pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by
operation of law), by Acquiror or an Effective Time Holder or be taken or
reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt
or other liability of Acquiror or such Effective Time Holder or used for any
reason, prior to (i) in the case of Acquiror, the retention of IP Escrow
Shares or IP Escrow Cash in satisfaction of a resolved Claim for IP Damages in
accordance with this Agreement or (ii) in the case of the Effective Time
Holders, the release by Acquiror to the Effective Time Holders of IP Escrow
Shares, IP Escrow Dividends, IP Escrow Cash or IP Escrow Earnings in
accordance with this Agreement, except that Effective Time Holders shall be
entitled to assign their rights to the IP Escrow Shares, IP Escrow Cash, IP
Escrow Dividends or IP Escrow Earnings by will, by the laws of intestacy or by
other operation of law.



(h) _No Liability of Acquiror_. In holding and administering the IP Escrow
Shares, IP Escrow Cash, IP Escrow Dividends and IP Escrow Earnings, Acquiror
will incur no liability with respect to any action taken by it in reliance
upon any written notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other
document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed by the
Representative (and shall have no responsibility to determine the authenticity
thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except Acquirors own
willful misconduct or gross negligence. In all questions arising under this
Agreement with respect to the IP Escrow Shares, IP Escrow Cash, IP Escrow
Dividends and IP Escrow Earnings, Acquiror may rely on the advice of counsel,
and Acquiror will not be liable to anyone for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by Acquiror based on such advice, except for Acquirors
own willful misconduct or gross negligence.



2.9 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Conversion of Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time of the First
Merger, all outstanding Company Capital Stock shall, by virtue of the First
Merger and without further action, cease to exist, and all such stock shall be
converted into the right to receive from Acquiror the number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock and amount of cash to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ with respect to such stock, subject to
the provisions of _Section 2.4(c)_ (regarding rights of holders of Dissenting
Shares), _Section 2.4(e)_ (regarding the continuation of vesting and
repurchase rights), _Section 2.7_ (regarding the  



 

21  withholding of General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash) and _Section
2.8_ (regarding the withholding of IP Escrow Shares and IP Escrow Cash). 



(b) _Company Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any
event within 10 business days) after the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall
cause to be mailed to each holder of record of Company Capital Stock that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the certificates
evidencing such securities being "Company Certificates") and which were
converted into the right to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock and cash
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ the following: (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Company Certificates to Acquiror and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Acquiror may reasonably specify and contain an
agreement to be bound by the indemnification provisions hereof); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates in
exchange for the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock and amount of cash
specified in this _Article 2_. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate for
cancellation or upon delivery of an affidavit of lost certificate and an
indemnity or bond in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror
(the "Affidavit") (together with any required Form W-9 or Form W-8) to
Acquiror, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, Acquiror shall issue or
cause to be issued to each tendering holder of a Company Certificate or an
Affidavit (each, a "Tendering Company Holder") the number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock and amount of cash to which such Tendering Company
Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ , subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.4(c)_ (regarding rights of holders of Dissenting Shares), _Section
2.4(e)_ (regarding the continuation of vesting and repurchase rights),
_Section 2.7_ (regarding the withholding of General Escrow Shares and General
Escrow Cash) and _Section 2.8_ (regarding the withholding of IP Escrow Shares
and IP Escrow Cash). Until Company Certificates are surrendered or an
Affidavit is delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.9(b)_ , such Company
Certificates shall be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence ownership of the
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock and amount of cash which Company
Capital Stock shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ ,
subject to the provisions of _Section 2.4(c)_ (regarding rights of holders of
Dissenting Shares), _Section 2.4(e)_ (regarding the continuation of vesting
and repurchase rights),  _Section 2.7_ (regarding the withholding of General
Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash) and _Section 2.8_ (regarding the
withholding of IP Escrow Shares and IP Escrow Cash).



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates_. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time of the First
Merger with respect to Acquiror Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Certificate with respect to the shares of Acquiror Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Company Certificate shall surrender
such Company Certificate as provided in this _Section 2.9_. Following
surrender of any such Company Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time  



 

22  but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock.



(d) _Company Stock Transfer Books_. All shares of Acquiror Common Stock and
cash issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Capital Stock. After the Effective Time of the First Merger, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company or its transfer agent of any Company Capital Stock that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger. If,
after the Effective Time of the First Merger, any Company Certificates or
Affidavits are presented for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this _Section 2.9_.



(e) _No Liability of Acquiror_. Neither Acquiror nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock
for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Company Certificate has not
been surrendered prior to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time of the
First Merger (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
First Merger consideration contemplated by this Agreement in respect of such
Company Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any amounts payable in respect of such Company
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Acquiror, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Acquiror shall be entitled to rely without
inquiry or investigation on the information contained in the Spreadsheet and
shall make the payments and distributions contemplated by _Article 2_ and
_Article 3_ in accordance with such information, and neither Acquiror nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any liability to any Person for making such
payments and distributions in accordance with such information.



2.10 _Tax Consequences, Withholding and Reporting; Accounting Treatment_.



(a) _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. By executing this Agreement, the parties intend to adopt a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).
The Company and, by virtue of the Company Stockholders approving the Merger,
this Agreement and the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby,
the Company Stockholders, acknowledge that the Company and the Company
Stockholders are relying solely on their own tax advisors in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions or agreements
contemplated hereby.



(b) _Tax Withholding_. Acquiror or Acquirors agents shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any shares or cash otherwise distributable pursuant
to this Agreement to any Company Stockholder, the amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Stockholder in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.



 

23 (c) _Tax Reporting_. The Representative shall provide Acquiror with certified
tax identification numbers for each of the Effective Time Holders by
furnishing appropriate original Form W-9 (or Form W-8, in the case of non-U.S.
persons) and other forms and documents that Acquiror may reasonably request
(collectively, "Tax Reporting Documentation") within 30 calendar days after
the Closing Date (to the extent such Tax Reporting Documentation has not
already been furnished by a Tendering Company Holder with its letter of
transmittal pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_ ). The parties hereto understand
that, if such Tax Reporting Documentation is not so certified to Acquiror
shall be required by the Code to withhold a portion of any interest or other
income earned on the investment of monies or other property held by Acquiror
pursuant to this Agreement.



(d) _Accounting Treatment_. The parties intend that the Merger be treated as a
purchase for accounting purposes.



2.11 _Adjustments for Capital Changes_. Any provision of this Agreement shall
be adjusted to appropriately reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, combination, recapitalization or other similar event affecting
Acquiror Common Stock or Company Capital Stock and shall be reflected in an
updated Spreadsheet as appropriate.



2.12 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the
Effective Time, Acquiror reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the Company, Acquiror,
the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.



ARTICLE 3

EARNOUT



3.1 _First Booking Earnout_. On the forty-fifth calendar day (or
next business day if such calendar day is not a business day) ("First Booking
Earnout Distribution Date") after the first booking (as defined in the
Bookings Guidelines) of at least one or more copies of the initial Company
Product ("Initial Company Product") (as defined in the technical
specifications set forth in the Product Development Roadmap substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ , as amended from time to time by
written consent of Acquiror and the Representative (the "Product Roadmap"))
which is or are (a) in excess of an aggregate of $300,000 (after counting the
dollar value of any preceding bookings of the Company Product) and (b)
involves a top 100 semiconductor company (as ranked by Dataquest or a
comparable independent market research firm) or an existing Acquiror customer
doing a tape-out in TSMC/IBM 90 nm technology, Acquiror shall distribute to
the Effective Time Holders, at their respective addresses and in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares set forth in the Spreadsheet, (x)
$10,000,000 in Acquiror Common Stock (the "First Booking Stock Earnout") and
(y) $10,000,000 in cash (the "First Booking Cash Earnout" and collectively
with the First Booking Stock Earnout, the "First Booking Earnout"). The number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued as  



 

24  the First Booking Stock Earnout shall be determined by dividing (i) the
amount of the First Booking Stock Earnout by (ii) the First Booking Stock
Price. In the event that the first booking of the Initial Company Product
(satisfying the criteria set forth in the immediately preceding clauses
(a)-(b) of this _Section 3.1_ ) has not occurred by the specific date therefor
set forth in the Product Roadmap, then the base salaries of the individuals
who are parties to the Employment Offer Letters shall be reduced by the
amounts set forth in their respective Employment Offer Letters until such
first booking of the Initial Company Product has occurred. Following the
Closing, Acquiror shall fund the operations of the Surviving Corporation
according to the Post-Closing Operating Budget and Headcount Plan
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ , as amended from
time to time by written consent of Acquiror and the Representative
("Operating Plan"). From the Closing Date until March 31, 2009, (i) Acquiror
will fund the Operating Plan according to the headcount and expense metrics
set forth therein, and will provide such support as is reasonably necessary
to help enable achievement of the Technical Milestones in the Product Roadmap
and (ii) Acquiror will provide reasonable levels of sales and marketing
support for Company Products on the Product Roadmap in light of market
demand, customer requirements, product life cycles, product sales, product
margins, competitive concerns and other relevant considerations.



3.2 _Subsequent Booking Earnout_. On the forty-fifth calendar day (or next
business day if such calendar day is not a business day) ("Subsequent Booking
Earnout Distribution Date") after the completion of each series of two
consecutive fiscal quarters of Acquiror ("Subsequent Booking Earnout Period"),
beginning with the fiscal quarter in which the Closing occurs and ending with
the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2009 (it being understood that if this
entire period encompasses an odd number of fiscal quarters of Acquiror that
the first Subsequent Booking Earnout Period shall consist of three
consecutive fiscal quarters), Acquiror shall distribute to the Effective Time
Holders, at their respective addresses and in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares set forth in the Spreadsheet, ************ of bookings (as
defined in the Bookings Guidelines) of Company Products (as specified in the
Product Roadmap and the Bookings Guidelines) during the Subsequent Booking
Earnout Period (it being understood that such calculation shall include
bookings attributable to customer purchase orders or contracts executed prior
to March 31, 2009, even if the duration of a particular purchase order or
contract extends beyond March 31, 2009), (a) ***** in Acquiror Common Stock
(the "Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout") and (b) ***** in cash (the
"Subsequent Booking Cash Earnout" and collectively with the Subsequent Booking
Stock Earnout, the "Subsequent Booking Earnout"). The number of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued for a particular Subsequent Booking
Stock Earnout shall be determined by dividing (i) the amount of the Subsequent
Booking Stock Earnout by (ii) the Average Acquiror Stock Price for the period
ending on (and including) the trading day that is three trading days prior to
the applicable Subsequent Booking Earnout Distribution Date. The calculation
of the amount of bookings of Company Products attributable to a particular
order or contract shall be determined according to the Bookings Calculation
Guidelines substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ , as
amended from time to time by written consent of Acquiror and the
Representative ("Bookings Guidelines").

filing and have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

25 3.3 _Limitations on Earnout_.



(a) _Dollar Limitation_. In no event shall the aggregate Subsequent Booking
Earnouts (including any amount of recoveries against the Subsequent Booking
Earnouts made pursuant to _Article 12_ ) exceed $95,000,000 (with shares of
Acquiror Common Stock included in Subsequent Booking Earnouts valued in the
manner set forth in _Section 3.2_  with respect to the respective
distribution dates thereof).



(b) _Milestone Limitation_. In the event that any technical milestone, as
described in the Product Roadmap ("Technical Milestone"), is not achieved on
or before the scheduled date set forth in the Product Roadmap for such
Technical Milestone ("Milestone Schedule Date"), then (i) all Subsequent
Booking Earnout earned after such Milestone Schedule Date through the
Milestone Schedule Date for the next scheduled Technical Milestone in the
Product Roadmap (or in the event that the Technical Milestone in question is
the last scheduled Technical Milestone in the Product Roadmap, through March
31, 2009) shall be withheld by Acquiror and none of such Subsequent
Booking Earnout shall be distributed by Acquiror to the Effective Time
Holders unless such Technical Milestone is achieved, (ii) if such Technical
Milestone is achieved on or prior to March 31, 2009, then such withheld
Subsequent Booking Earnout shall (subject to any other rights of Acquiror
hereunder) be distributed by Acquiror to the Effective Time Holders on the
Subsequent Booking Earnout Distribution Date following the Subsequent Booking
Earnout Period in which such Technical Milestone is achieved (with the number
of shares to be distributed determined in the manner set forth in _Section
3.2_ ), and (iii) if such Technical Milestone is not achieved on or prior to
March 31, 2009, then such withheld Subsequent Booking Earnout shall be
forfeited by the Effective Time Holders and shall not be distributed or
reallocated to any Company Securityholders. The Representative shall notify
Acquirors President (in the manner set forth in _Section 13.9_ ) as soon as
reasonably practicable after he believes that a Technical Milestone has been
achieved. After receipt of such a notice from the Representative, Acquirors
President shall, in consultation with the management and technical staff of
Acquiror (including technical staff working on the Company Products),
determine whether he agrees that such Technical Milestone has been achieved
and shall notify the Representative (in the manner set forth in _Section 13.9_
) of his determination as soon as reasonably practicable. If the
Representative objects to such determination, Acquiror and the Representative
shall resolve such conflict in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 12.8_ , and no portion of such Subsequent Booking Earnout shall be
distributed to the Effective Time Holders until following the resolution of
such conflict. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Technical Milestone is
achieved in all material respects, but there exists a failure to conform with
a specific element or elements of any such Technical Milestone which failure
does not result in either (x) a material degradation of the functionality of
such element or elements of the Company Product from that contemplated by the
Product Roadmap or (y) a material decrease in the overall marketability of
such Company Product relative to that contemplated by the Product Roadmap,
then such failure will not be deemed a non-achievement of the Technical
Milestone.



(c) _Share Limitation_. In no event shall the aggregate number or voting
power of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued or issuable as Initial Stock
Consideration, First Booking Stock Consideration or Subsequent Booking Stock
Consideration ever exceed 19.9% of the number of shares or voting power
of Acquiror outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First
Merger (as calculated and determined according to Applicable Law and the  



 

26  rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market); _provided_ , that
Acquiror shall substitute cash for shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the
terms hereof in excess of such limit (even if doing so would cause the Merger
to fail to qualify as a tax-deferred "reorganization" under the Code), unless
the Representative agrees on behalf of the Effective Time Holders to forfeit
the amount of cash that would result in the loss of such tax-deferred
treatment.



(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock
shall be issued as part of the First Booking Stock Earnout or Subsequent
Booking Stock Earnout, but in lieu thereof each Effective Time Holder
otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the
Average Acquiror Stock Price for the period ending on the trading day that is
three trading days prior to the date of issuance of the First Booking Stock
Earnout or Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout, as the case may be, by (ii) the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
Acquiror shall be deemed to have purchased all such fractional interests
which it has distributed cash in lieu of (rounded down to the nearest whole
share after aggregating all such fractional interests).



(e) _Earnout with Respect to Unvested Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the First Booking Earnout and
Subsequent Booking Earnouts, if any, that are issuable with respect to
Unvested Company Shares surrendered in the First Merger shall remain subject
to the repurchase option, vesting schedule or other condition applicable to
the Unvested Acquiror Shares and Unvested Acquiror Cash issued in exchange for
such Unvested Company Shares, determined as if the First Booking Earnout and
Subsequent Booking Earnouts were issued as Unvested Acquiror Shares and
Unvested Acquiror Cash at the Effective Time of the First Merger and then
continued to vest (assuming vesting by virtue of continuous service to the
Surviving Corporation or Acquiror or by acceleration pursuant to the terms of
the applicable Employment Offer Letter) until the First Booking Earnout
Distribution Date or Subsequent Booking Earnout Distribution Date, as
applicable. For purposes of clarifying the foregoing, if at the time a First
Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout is distributed with respect to
formerly outstanding Unvested Company Shares, the Acquiror Common Stock and
cash comprising such First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout (i)
would have remained subject to a repurchase option, vesting schedule or other
condition had the Acquiror Common Stock and cash been issued as Unvested
Acquiror Shares and Unvested Acquiror Cash at the Effective Time of the First
Merger, then such First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout
shall likewise be subject to such repurchase option, vesting schedule or
other condition as of the time of such distribution and shall continue to vest
in accordance with the remainder of the applicable vesting schedule; (ii)
would have been vested as of the time of such distribution had the Acquiror
Common Stock and cash been issued as Unvested Acquiror Shares and Unvested
Acquiror Cash at the Effective Time of the First Merger, then such First
Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout shall likewise be vested as of
the time of the distribution and shall not be subject to further vesting; and
(iii) would have been forfeited to Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation due
to a termination of the Effective Time Holders employment (unless any
Employment Offer Letter provides otherwise) or any other reason had the
Acquiror Common Stock and cash been issued as Unvested Acquiror Shares and
Unvested Acquiror Cash at the Effective Time of the First Merger, then such
First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout shall be forfeited, shall
not be distributed to such Effective Time Holder, and shall not be reallocated
to any other Company Securityholders.



 

27 Any First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout which shall continue
to be subject to a repurchase option, vesting schedule or other condition as
of the time of distribution pursuant to this _Section 3.3(d)_ shall be
withheld by Acquiror and paid without interest to the applicable Effective
Time Holders upon the vesting of such First Booking Earnout or Subsequent
Booking Earnout (assuming vesting by virtue of continuous service to the
Surviving Corporation or Acquiror or by acceleration pursuant to the terms of
the applicable Employment Offer Letter).



(f) _Indemnification Claims_. If, in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 12.3(a)-(b)_ , prior to the date scheduled for payment of the First
Booking Earnout or any Subsequent Booking Earnout (but in no event later than
the third anniversary of the Effective Time of the First Merger), Acquiror
delivers a Notice of Claim (as defined in _Article 12_ and as limited by
_Section 12.3_ ) to the Representative specifying that any earned but unpaid
First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout is necessary to satisfy
a Claim (as defined in _Article 12_ and as limited by _Section 12.3_ ) for
Damages (as defined in _Article 12_ ) for which Acquiror may seek
indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.3(a)-(b)_ and such Claim remains
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of the date scheduled for payment of
the earnout, then Acquiror shall (subject to the limitations of _Section
12.3(a)-(b)_ ) retain possession and custody of that amount of First Booking
Stock Earnout, First Booking Cash Earnout, Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout
or Subsequent Booking Cash Earnout, as applicable (with shares of Acquiror
Common Stock retained being deemed to have a per share value determined in the
manner set forth in _Section 12.3(d)_ ) that equals the total maximum amount
of Damages then being claimed by Acquiror Indemnified Persons in all such
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims, and within 10 business days
following resolution of all such Claims, Acquiror shall release to
the Effective Time Holders, at their respective addresses and in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares of the First Booking Stock Earnout,
First Booking Cash Earnout, Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout or Subsequent
Booking Cash Earnout, as applicable, all remaining First Booking Stock
Earnout, First Booking Cash Earnout, Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout or
Subsequent Booking Cash Earnout, as applicable, if any, not required to
satisfy such Claims for which Acquiror may seek indemnification pursuant to
_Section 12.3(a)-(b)_. Such releases of First Booking Cash Earnout and
Subsequent Booking Cash Earnout shall be made by check. If the number of First
Booking Stock Earnout or Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout shares to be
distributed to any Effective Time Holder is not evenly divisible by one,
Acquiror shall round down the number of shares to be distributed to the
nearest whole share. In lieu of the fractional interest not distributed,
Acquiror shall distribute to such Effective Time Holder cash in an amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fractional interest and (ii) the Average Acquiror Price (determined in the
manner set forth in _Section 12.3(d)_ ). The payment of any First Booking
Stock Earnout or Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout in satisfaction of any
indemnification obligations under and in accordance with _Article 12_ shall be
made, with respect to each Effective Time Holder, first with Vested Acquiror
Shares and then, if such shares are insufficient to satisfy such
indemnification obligation and only to the extent of such insufficiency, shall
such payment be made with Unvested Acquiror Shares. The payment of any First
Booking Cash Earnout or Subsequent Booking Cash Earnout in satisfaction of
any indemnification obligations under and in accordance with _Article 12_
shall be made, with respect to each Effective Time Holder, first with Vested
Acquiror Cash and then, if such cash is insufficient to satisfy such
indemnification obligation and only to the extent of such insufficiency, shall
such payment be made with Unvested Acquiror Cash.



 

28 (g) _Bookings Policy_. Orders or contracts for Company Products will qualify
as bookings for purposes of this _Article 3_ in accordance with the Bookings
Guidelines.



(h) _Earnout Rights Not Transferable_. No portion of the First Booking Earnout
or any Subsequent Booking Earnout may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned
or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by an Effective
Time Holder or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other liability of such holder, prior to
the distribution to such holder of such First Booking Earnout or Subsequent
Booking Earnout in accordance with this Agreement.



3.4 _Earnout Distributions_.



(a) _Earnout Notice_. Within 10 calendar days following the end of each
Subsequent Booking Earnout Period (or in the case of the First Booking
Earnout, the date of the first booking(s) of copy(ies) of the Initial Company
Product satisfying the conditions set forth in clauses (a)-(b) of _Section
3.1_ ), Acquiror shall deliver to the Representative a memorandum
(the "Earnout Notice") (i) stating the dollar value of the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock and cash to be distributed with respect to such Subsequent
Booking Earnout Period (or First Booking Earnout Period) and (ii) specifying
in reasonable detail Acquirors calculation of such dollar value and, if
applicable under _Article 12_ , any proposed recovery for Damages. All
distributions of First Booking Earnout and Subsequent Booking Earnout amounts
will be subject to applicable tax withholding.



(b)  _Representative Objection_. The Representative shall, within 10 calendar
days after delivery of the Earnout Notice, deliver to Acquiror in writing any
objection thereto. Any such objection shall be in reasonable detail and
include the specific component or components of Acquirors earnout
calculation or proposed set off in dispute. To the extent not specifically and
expressly disputed in a timely manner, Acquirors earnout calculation and
proposed set off shall be conclusive and binding on the Representative and
the Effective Time Holders. If the Representative objects in writing to
Acquirors earnout calculation or proposed set off prior to the expiration of
such 10 calendar day period, no portion of the First Booking Earnout or
Subsequent Booking Earnout, as the case may be, shall be distributed to the
Effective Time Holders or set off against by Acquiror, and Acquiror and the
Representative shall resolve such conflict in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 12.8_ for Contested Claims (as defined in _Section
12.8_ ).



(c) _Earnout as Merger Consideration_. Any First Booking Earnout or Subsequent
Booking Earnout payable to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to this
_Article 3_ will not constitute compensation for services but rather will
constitute part of the consideration for the Company Capital Stock acquired by
Acquiror in the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that a portion of the First
Booking Cash Earnout and/or Subsequent Booking Cash Earnout shall be treated
as imputed interest for the First Booking Earnout and/or Subsequent Booking
Earnout to the extent required under the Code.



(d) _Access to Information_. Acquiror agrees to provide promptly all
information as reasonably requested by the Representative or its advisor or
agent, and to make available for inspection and review to the Representative
or its advisor or agent, during regular  



 

29  business hours upon reasonable prior notice, the books and records of
Acquiror relating to the Company Business, in each case reasonably relevant to
the determination of whether the conditions to the distribution of First
Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout have been satisfied and the
calculation of First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout amounts.
Access to such information, books and records will be conditioned upon
execution by the Representative and its designated advisors and agents of a
confidentiality agreement acceptable to Acquiror. Acquiror shall maintain
financial books and records reasonable necessary to support and document the
determination of whether the conditions to the distribution of First Booking
Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnout have been satisfied and the calculation
of First Booking Earnout and Subsequent Booking Earnout amounts.

a representation or warranty herein (each of which exceptions, in order to be
effective, shall indicate the section and, if applicable, the subsection of
this _Article 4_ to which it relates (unless and to the extent the relevance
to other representations and warranties is reasonably apparent from the face
of the disclosed exception), and each of which exceptions shall also be deemed
to be representations and warranties made by the Company under this _Article
4_ ), the Company represents and warrants to Acquiror as follows. The Company
shall be entitled to deliver an update to the Company Disclosure Letter
("Disclosure Letter Update") to Acquiror no later than two business days prior

the Companys knowledge, each Company Stockholder has good and marketable
title to that number of shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company
Preferred Stock as set forth beside such Company Stockholders name on
_Schedule 4.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, free and clear of any
Encumbrance. All issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock have been duly

issued in violation of and are not subject to any right of rescission, right
of first refusal or preemptive right, and have been offered, issued, sold and
delivered by the Company in compliance with all requirements of Applicable Law
and all requirements set forth in applicable Contracts. There is no Liability
for dividends accrued and unpaid by the Company.



(b) _Options, Warrants and Rights_. The Company has reserved an aggregate of
3,635,959 shares of Company Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Company
Option Plan (including shares subject to outstanding Company Options). A
total of 15,000 shares of Company Common Stock are subject to outstanding

of Company Options for Company Common Stock as provided in this Agreement,
without the consent or approval of the holders of such Company Options, the
Company Stockholders or otherwise and without acceleration of the exercise
schedule or vesting provisions in effect for such Company Options. Correct and
complete copies of the Company Option Plan, the standard agreement under the
Company Option Plan, and each agreement for each Company Option that does not
conform to the standard agreement under the Company Option Plan have been
delivered by the Company to Acquirors legal counsel. All Company Options have
been issued and granted in compliance with Applicable Law and
all requirements set forth in applicable Contracts. On the Closing Date, the

Corporation.

extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment,
conversion privilege or preemptive or other right or Contract. There are no
voting agreements, registration rights, rights of first refusal, preemptive
rights, co-sale rights or other restrictions applicable to any outstanding
securities of the Company.



4.5 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
of the Company Ancillary Agreements by the Company, nor the consummation of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, shall
conflict with, or (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) result in
a termination, breach, impairment or violation of, or constitute a default
under: (a) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
the Company, each as currently in effect; (b) any Applicable Law applicable
to the Company or any of its assets or properties; or (c) any Contract to
which the Company is a party or by which the Company or any of its assets or
properties are bound. Neither the Companys entering into this Agreement nor
the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated thereby shall
give rise to, or trigger the application of, any rights of any third party
that would come into effect upon the consummation of the Merger. The
consummation of the Merger by the Company shall not require the consent,
release, waiver or approval of any third party (including the consent of any
party required to be obtained in order to keep any agreement between such
party and the Company in effect following the Merger or to provide that the
Company is not in breach or violation of any such agreement following the
Merger), other than the Company Stockholder Approval.



 

33 4.6 _Litigation_.



(a) There is no action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or
investigation pending against the Company (or against any officer, director
or employee of the Company in their capacity as such or relating to their
employment, services or relationship with the Company) before any Governmental
Authority, arbitrator or mediator, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has
any such action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or
investigation been threatened. There is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule
or order of any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator outstanding
against the Company. To the Companys knowledge, there is no basis for any
person to assert a claim against the Company based upon: (i) the Companys
entering into this Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement
or consummating the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement; or (ii) a claim of ownership of,
or options, warrants or other rights to acquire ownership of, any shares of
Company Capital Stock or any rights as a Company securityholder, including
any option, warrant, preemptive right or right to notice or to vote, other
than the rights of the Company Stockholders with respect to the Company Stock
shown as being owned by such Persons on  _Schedule 4.4(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter and the rights of Company Optionholders with respect to the
Company Options shown as being owned by such Persons on _Schedule 4.4(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any
action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation
pending against any Governmental Authority or other Person.



 

(b) The Company has not received written notice of any matter that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any indemnity claim under _Section
8.5_ , except as set forth in _Schedule 4.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.



4.7 _Taxes_. The Company (and any consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate
group for tax purposes of which the Company is or has been a member), (a) has
properly completed and timely filed all foreign, federal, state, local and
municipal tax and information returns (the "Returns") required to be filed by
it, (b) has timely paid all taxes required to be paid by it for which payment
was due, (c) has established an adequate accrual or reserve in accordance with
GAAP for the payment of all taxes payable in respect of the periods or
portions thereof prior to the Balance Sheet Date (which accrual or reserve as
of the Balance Sheet Date is fully reflected on the Company Balance Sheet),
(d) has made all necessary estimated tax payments, and (e) has no Liability
for taxes in excess of the amount so paid or accruals or reserves so
established except for taxes subsequent to the Balance Sheet Date incurred in
the ordinary course of business. All such Returns are true, correct and
complete, and the Company has provided Acquiror with correct and complete
copies of such Returns. The Company is not delinquent in the payment of any
tax or in the filing of any Returns, and no deficiencies for any tax have been
threatened, claimed, proposed or assessed against the Company or any of its
officers, employees or agents in their capacity as such. The Company has not
received any written notification from the Internal Revenue Service or any
other taxing authority regarding any material issues that (a) are currently
pending before the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing agency or
authority (including any sales or use taxing authority) regarding the
Company, or (b) have been raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other
taxing agency or authority and not yet finally resolved. No Return of the
Company is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing
agency or authority and any such past audits (if any) have  



 

34  been completed and fully resolved to the satisfaction of the applicable
taxing agency or authority conducting such audit and all taxes determined by
such audit to be due from the Company have been paid in full to the
applicable taxing agencies or authorities. No tax liens are currently in
effect against any of the assets of the Company other than liens that arise by
operation of law for taxes not yet due and payable. There is not in effect
any waiver by the Company of any statute of limitations with respect to any
taxes nor has the Company agreed to any extension of time for filing any
Return that has not been filed. The Company has not consented to extend to a
date later than the Agreement Date the period in which any tax may be assessed
or collected by any taxing agency or authority. The Company has complied (and
until the Closing Date will comply) with all Applicable Law relating to the
payment and withholding of taxes (including withholding of taxes pursuant to
Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code or similar provisions under any
foreign law), has, within the time and in the manner prescribed by
law, withheld from employee wages and paid over to the proper taxing agencies
and authorities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under all
Applicable Law (including Federal Insurance Contribution Act, Medicare,
Federal Unemployment Tax Act and relevant state income and employment tax
withholding laws), including federal and state income taxes, and has timely
filed all withholding tax Returns. The Company is not a party to or bound by
any tax sharing, tax indemnity, or tax allocation agreement nor does the
Company have any liability or potential liability to another party under any
such agreement. The Company has not filed any disclosures under Section 6662
of the Code or comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law to
prevent the imposition of penalties with respect to any tax reporting position
taken on any Return. The Company has not consummated, has not participated in,
and is not currently participating in any transaction which was or is a "tax
shelter" transaction as defined in Sections 6662, 6011, 6012 or 6111 of the
Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company has never
been a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group of
which the Company was not the ultimate parent corporation. The Company has no
liability for the taxes of any Person (other than the Company) under Section
1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar provision of state, local
or foreign law) as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.
Neither the Company, nor any "dual resident corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 1503(d) of the Code) in which the Company is considered to hold an
interest, has incurred a dual consolidated loss within the meaning of Section
1503 of the Code. The Company is not a "personal holding company" within the
meaning of the Code. The Company has never been a "United States real property
holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code, and the
Company has filed with the Internal Revenue Service all statements, if any,
which are required under Section 1.897-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations. The
Company has not constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free
treatment under Section 355 of the Code (a) in the two years prior to the
Agreement Date or (b) in a distribution that could otherwise constitute part
of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.



4.8 _Company Financial Statements_. _Schedule 4.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter includes the Company Financial Statements. The Company Financial
Statements: (a) are derived from and are in accordance with the books and
records of the Company; (b) fairly present the financial condition of the
Company at the dates therein indicated and the results of operations and cash
flows of the Company for the periods therein specified (subject, in the case
of unaudited interim period financial statements, to normal recurring year-end
audit adjustments,  



 

35  none of which individually or in the aggregate will be material in amount);
(c) complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements with respect thereto as of their respective dates,
and (d) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with prior periods (except that the unaudited financial statements
do not have notes thereto). The Company has no Liability, except for those
(a) shown on the Company Balance Sheet and (b) that were incurred after the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of the Companys business consistent
with its past practices, that (i) are not in excess of $10,000, either
individually or collectively, (ii) do not result from any breach of Contract,
tort or violation of law, and (iii) are not required to be set forth in the
Balance Sheet under GAAP. All reserves established by the Company that are
set forth in or reflected in the Company Balance Sheet have been established
in accordance with GAAP and are adequate. At the Balance Sheet Date, there
were no material loss contingencies (as such term is used in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board in March 1975) that are not adequately provided for in the
Company Balance Sheet as required by said Statement No. 5.



4.9 _Title to Properties_. The Company has good and marketable title to all
of its assets and properties (including those shown on the Company Balance
Sheet), free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances.
Such assets include all of the assets that are not Intellectual Property
necessary for the continued operation of the Company Business. All properties
used in the operations of the Company Business are reflected on the Company
Balance Sheet to the extent required under GAAP to be so reflected. All
machinery, vehicles, equipment and other tangible personal property owned or
leased by the Company or used in the Company Business are (a) in good
condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted, and (b) not obsolete,
dangerous or in need of renewal or replacement, except for renewal or
replacement in the ordinary course of business. All leases of real or personal
property to which the Company is a party are fully effective and afford the
Company valid leasehold possession of the real or personal property that is
the subject of the lease. The Company is not in violation of any zoning,
building, safety or environmental ordinance, regulation or requirement or
other law or regulation applicable to the operation of its owned or leased
properties, nor has the Company received any written notice of violation of
law with which it has not complied. The Company does not own any real
property. _Schedule 4.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all personal property owned or leased by the
Company with an individual value of $5,000 or greater. The Company has access,
on commercially reasonable terms, to all products and services reasonably
necessary to carry on the Company Businesses, and the Company has no knowledge
of any reason why it will not continue to have such access on commercially
reasonable terms.



4.10 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company
has operated its business in the ordinary course consistent with its past
practices, and since such date there has not been with respect to the Company
any:

effect that could reasonably be expect to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

of its business consistent with its past practices after the Balance Sheet
Date in an amount not in excess of $10,000 for any single Liability to a
particular creditor;

other intangible assets), properties or goodwill other than the sale or

of employees who are not officers in an amount that does not exceed 10% of

(p) any Contract with a Governmental Authority or any Governmental Permit (as
defined in _Section 4.14(c)_ ); or



(q) any other Contract that is material to it or its business, operations,
financial condition, properties or assets.



A true and complete copy of each agreement or document required by
these subsections (a)-(q) of this _Section 4.11_ to be listed on _Schedule
4.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter has been delivered to Acquirors legal
counsel. All Company Material Contracts are in written form.



4.12 _No Default; No Restrictions_.



(a) The Company has performed all of the material obligations required to be
performed by it and is entitled to all material benefits under each Company
Material Contract. Each of the Company Material Contracts is in full force and
effect. There exists no default or event of default or event, occurrence,
condition or act, with respect to the Company or to the knowledge of the
Company, with respect to any other contracting party, which, with the giving
of notice, the lapse of time or the happening of any other event or
conditions, would reasonably be expected to (i) become a default or event of
default under any Company Material Contract or (ii) give any third party (1)
the right to declare a default or exercise any remedy under any Company
Material Contract, (2) the right to a rebate, chargeback, refund, credit,
penalty or change in delivery schedule under any Company Material Contract,
(3) the right to accelerate the  



 

40  maturity or performance of any obligation of the Company under any Company
Material Contract, or (4) the right to cancel, terminate or modify any
Company Material Contract. The Company has not received any written, or, to
the Companys knowledge, oral notice or other communication regarding any
actual or possible violation or breach of or default under, or intention to
cancel or modify, any Company Material Contract. The consummation of the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company shall not
require the consent, release, waiver or approval of any third party (including
the consent of any party required to be obtained in order to keep any
Material Contract between such party and the Company in effect following the
Merger). The Company has no Liability for renegotiation of government
contracts or subcontracts.



(b) Except as listed in _Schedule 4.11(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company is not a party to, and no asset or property of the Company is
bound or affected by, any judgment, injunction, order, decree, Contract
(noncompete or otherwise) that restricts or prohibits, or purports
to restrict or prohibit, the Company or, following the Effective Time of the
Second Merger, the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, from freely engaging in
the Company Business or from competing anywhere in the world (including any
judgments, injunctions, orders, decrees, Contracts restricting the geographic
area in which the Company may sell, license, market, distribute or support any
products or technology or provide services or restricting the markets,
customers or industries that the Company may address in operating the Company
Business or restricting the prices which the Company may charge for its
products, technology or services (including most favored customer pricing
provisions)), or includes any grants by the Company of exclusive rights or
licenses, rights of refusal, rights of first negotiation or similar rights.



4.13 _Intellectual Property_.



(a) The Company (i) owns and has independently developed or (ii) has the valid
right or license to use, possess, develop, sell, license, copy, distribute,
market, advertise and/or dispose of, all Intellectual Property used in the
conduct of the Current Business, embodied in any Company Product or Service
(as defined below), or used in connection with any Company Product or Service
as of the Effective Time of the Effective Time of the First Merger (such
Intellectual Property being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Company IP Rights"). Such Company IP Rights are sufficient for such conduct
of the Current Business, and for the licensing, sale and distribution of any
Company Product or Service (as defined below). As used in this Agreement,
"Company-Owned IP Rights" means Company IP Rights that are or are purportedly
owned or exclusively licensed to the Company or any Subsidiary; and "Company-
Licensed IP Rights" means Company IP Rights that are not Company-Owned IP
Rights.



(b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the
Company Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or by the Company Ancillary
Agreements shall, in accordance with their terms: (i) constitute a material
breach of or default under any instrument, license or other Contract
governing any Company IP Right (collectively, the "Company IP Rights
Agreements"); (ii) cause the forfeiture or termination of, or give rise to a
right of forfeiture or termination of, any Company IP Right; or (iii)
materially impair the right of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to
use, possess, sell or license any Company IP Right or  



 

41  portion thereof (except to the extent such impairment arises from Contracts
of Acquiror or its Subsidiaries other than the Company or the
Surviving Corporation). There are no royalties, honoraria, fees or other
payments payable by the Company to any third person (other than salaries
payable to employees and independent contractors not contingent on or related
to use of their work product) as a result of the ownership, use, possession,
license-in, sale, marketing, advertising or disposition of any Company IP
Rights by the Company to the extent necessary for the conduct of the Current
Business or the use, sale, licensing or distribution of any Company Product
or Service and none shall become payable as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, all
Company-Owned IP Rights will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable
by the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror without restriction and without
payment of any kind to any third party.



(c) _Schedule 4.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list (by
name and version number) of each of the products and services currently
produced, manufactured, marketed, licensed, sold, furnished or distributed by
the Company and each product and service currently under development by the
Company, each solely in the form as it exists as of the Effective Time of the
First Merger (each a "Company Product or Service"). Neither the operation of
the Current Business, nor the use, development, manufacture, marketing,
license, sale or furnishing of any Company Product or Service (or any
component or portion thereof) (i) violates or will violate any license or
other Contract between the Company and any third party, or (ii) infringes or
misappropriates or will infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property
right of any other party, in each case where such violation, infringement or
misappropriation occurs as a result of such operation or because of such
Company Product or Service (or component or portion thereof). To the knowledge
of the Company, the Company and/or the Surviving Corporation will not need to
misappropriate the source code or other trade secrets of a third party in
order to complete the development of the Initial Company Product. There is no
pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, claim or litigation
contesting the validity, ownership or right of the Company to exercise any
Company IP Right, nor to the knowledge of the Company, is there any legitimate
basis for any such claim, nor has the Company received any notice asserting
that any Company IP Right or the proposed use, sale, license or disposition
thereof conflicts with or infringes or shall conflict with or infringe the
rights of any other party, nor to the knowledge of the Company, is there any
legitimate basis for any such assertion and the Company has not received any
notice from any third party offering a license under any such third party
patents. None of the Company-Owned IP Rights, or the Company Products or
Services (excluding any the Company-Licensed IP Rights embodied therein), or
the Company, and, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company-
Licensed IP Rights, is subject to any proceeding or outstanding order,
contract or stipulation (i) restricting in any manner the use,
distribution, transfer, or licensing by the Company of any Company-Owned IP
Rights, any Company-Licensed IP Rights or any Company Product or Service, or
which may affect the validity, use or enforceability of any such Company-Owned
IP Rights, Company-Licensed IP Rights or Company Product or Service, or (ii)
restricting the conduct of the Current Business in order to accommodate
Intellectual Property rights of a third party.



 

42 (d) No current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of the
Company: (i) is in material violation of any term or covenant of any
employment contract, patent disclosure agreement, invention assignment
agreement, nondisclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement or any other
Contract with any other party by virtue of such employees, consultants or
independent contractors being employed by, or performing services for, the
Company or using trade secrets or proprietary information of others without
permission in the Current Business or in connection with the development of
any Company Product or Service; or (ii) has developed any technology, software
or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work for the
Company that is subject to any Contract under which such employee, consultant
or independent contractor has assigned or otherwise granted to any third party
any rights (including Intellectual Property) in or to such technology,
software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary
work. Neither the employment of any employee of the Company, nor the use by
the Company of the services of any consultant or independent contractor
subjects the Company to any Liability to any third party for improperly
soliciting such employee, consultant or independent contractor to work for
the Company, whether such Liability is based on contractual or other legal
obligations to such third party.



(e) The Company has taken all reasonable steps under the circumstances to
protect, preserve and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the Company
IP Rights and to preserve and maintain all the Companys trade secrets in the
Company IP Rights. All current and former officers, employees, consultants and
independent contractors of the Company having access to trade secrets
or proprietary information of the Company, its customers or business partners
have executed and delivered to the Company an agreement regarding the
protection of such trade secrets or proprietary information (in the case of
trade secrets or proprietary information of the Companys customers and
business partners, to the extent required by such customers and business
partners); and copies of all such agreements have been delivered to Acquirors
legal counsel. The Company has secured valid written assignments from all of
the Companys current and former consultants, independent contractors and
employees who were involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or
development of any Company-Owned IP Rights, of the rights to
such contributions that may be owned by such persons or that the Company does
not already own by operation of law. No current or former employee, officer,
director, consultant or independent contractor of the Company has any right,
license, claim or interest whatsoever in or with respect to any Company-Owned
IP Rights. To the extent that any technology, software or Intellectual
Property developed or otherwise owned by a third party is incorporated into,
integrated or bundled with any of the Company Products or Services ("Third
Party Product Technology"), the Company has a written agreement with such
third party with respect thereto pursuant to which the Company either (i) has
obtained complete, unencumbered and unrestricted ownership of, and is the
exclusive owner of, or (ii) has obtained perpetual, irrevocable, non
terminable licenses (sufficient for the conduct of the Current Business and
the sale, licensing or distribution of the Company Product or Services) to,
all such third partys Intellectual Property in such Third Party Product
Technology by operation of law or by valid Contract. _Schedule 4.13(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list and description of all
Third Party Product Technology.



(f) _Schedule 4.13(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of (i) all worldwide registrations made by or on behalf of the
Company of any patents, copyrights, mask works, trademarks, service marks,
Internet domain names or Internet or World Wide Web URLs or addresses with
any Governmental Authority or quasi-governmental authority, including Internet
domain name registries, (ii) all applications,  



 

43  registrations, filings and other formal written governmental actions made or
taken pursuant to Applicable Law by the Company to secure, perfect or
protect its interest in the Company IP Rights, including all patent
applications, copyright applications, mask work applications and applications
for registration of trademarks and service marks, and where applicable the
jurisdiction in which each of the items of the Company IP Rights has been
applied for, filed, issued or registered, and (iii) all inter parties
proceedings or actions before any court or tribunal (including the United
States Patent and Trademark Office) or equivalent authority anywhere else in
the world) related to any of the Company IP Rights. All registered patents,
trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, Internet or World Wide Web
URLs or addresses, copyrights and mask work rights held by the Company
are valid, enforceable and subsisting, and the Company is the record owner
thereof. The Company is the exclusive owner of all trademarks and trade names
used in connection with the operation or conduct of the Current Business,
including the sale, licensing, distribution or provision of any Company
Products or Services by the Company. The Company owns exclusively, and has
good title to, all copyrighted works that are included or incorporated into
Company Products or Services or which the Company otherwise purports to own.



(g) The Company owns all right, title and interest in and to all Company-
Owned IP Rights free and clear of all Encumbrances and licenses (other than
licenses and rights listed in _Schedule 4.13(h)-1_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter and Permitted Encumbrances). The right, license and interest of the
Company in and to all Company-Licensed IP Rights are free and clear of all
Encumbrances and licenses (other than licenses and rights set forth in the
terms and conditions of the Contracts under which Company-Licensed IP Rights
are licensed to the Company, all of which Contracts are listed in _Schedule
4.13(h)-2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (and complete and correct copies
of such Contracts have been provided to counsel to Acquiror), and Permitted
Encumbrances).



(h)  _Schedule 4.13(h)-1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true
and complete list of all licenses, sublicenses and other Contracts as to which
the Company is a party and pursuant to which any Person is authorized to use
any Company-Owned IP Rights. _Schedule 4.13(h)-2_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a true and complete list of all licenses, sublicenses and
other Contracts as to which the Company is a party and pursuant to which the
Company is authorized to use any Company-Licensed IP Rights (other than
licenses of software generally available to the public at a per copy license
fee of less than $1,000 per copy). None of the licenses or other Contracts
listed in Schedule 4 _.13(h)-1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter grants any
third party exclusive rights to or under any Company-Owned IP Rights or grants
any third party the right to sublicense any of such Company-Owned IP Rights.
The Company has not transferred ownership of any Intellectual Property that
is or was owned by the Company, to any third party, or knowingly permitted the
Companys rights in such Intellectual Property to lapse or enter the public
domain (other than through the expiration of registered Intellectual Property
at the end of its statutory term). The Company has not taken actions that
caused confidential Intellectual Property to be made public, except for the
publication of applications or registrations relating to Intellectual Property
as required by Applicable Law.



(i) Neither the Company nor any other party acting on its behalf has
disclosed or delivered to any party, or permitted the disclosure or delivery
to any escrow agent or other party of, any Company Source Code (as defined
below) or any algorithm contained in or relating  



 

44  to the Company Source Code. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
shall, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or
delivery by the Company or any other party acting on its behalf to any party
of any Company Source Code. _Schedule 4.13(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter identifies each Contract (whether written or oral) pursuant to which
the Company has deposited, or is or may be required to deposit, with an escrow
agent or other party, any Company Source Code and further describes whether
the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in and of itself, would
reasonably be expected to result in the release from escrow of any Company
Source Code. As used in this _Section 4.13(i)_ , "Company Source Code" means,
collectively, any human readable software source code, or any material portion
or aspect of the software source code that constitutes Company-Owned IP
Rights.



(j) There, to the Companys knowledge, is no unauthorized use, disclosure,
infringement or misappropriation of any Company-Owned IP Rights by any third
party, including any employee or former employee of the Company. The Company
has not agreed to indemnify any person for any infringement of any
Intellectual Property of any third party by any Company Product or Service
that has been sold, licensed to third parties, leased to third parties,
supplied, marketed, distributed or provided by the Company.



(k) All software developed by the Company and licensed by the Company to
customers and all Company Products or Services provided by or through the
Company to customers on or prior to the Closing Date conform in all material
respects to applicable contractual commitments, express and implied warranties
(to the extent not expressly disclaimed in Contracts with such customers),
product specifications and product Documentation and to any representations
provided to customers, and the Company has no material Liability (and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no legitimate basis for any present or
future action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint,
claim or demand against the Company giving rise to any material Liability
relating to the foregoing Contracts) for replacement or repair thereof or
other damages in connection therewith in excess of any reserves therefor
reflected on the Company Balance Sheet. The Company has not had any of its
products returned by a purchaser thereof except for normal warranty returns
consistent with past history and those returns that would not result in a
reversal of any revenue by the Company. The Company has made available to
Acquiror all Documentation and notes relating to the testing of the Company
Products or Services and plans and specifications for Company Products or
Services currently under development by the Company. The Company has a policy
and procedure for tracking material bugs, errors and defects of which it
becomes aware in any Company Products or Services, and maintains a database
covering the foregoing. For all software used by the Company in providing
Company Products or Services, or in developing or making available any of the
Company Products or Services, the Company has, to its knowledge, implemented
any and all security patches or upgrades that are generally available for that
software and that would be material to the sale, licensing or distribution of
any Company Product or Service.



(l) No government funding, facilities of a university, college, other
educational institution or research center was used in the development of the
Company Products or Services, computer software programs or applications owned
by the Company. To the Companys knowledge, no current or former employee,
consultant or independent contractor of  



 

45  the Company who was involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or
development of any Company-Owned IP Rights has performed services for the
government, for a university, college or other educational institution or for
a research center during a period of time during which such employee,
consultant or independent contractor was also performing services for the
Company.



(m) No software covered by any Company-Owned IP Right has been distributed in
whole or in part or used, or is being used in conjunction with any Public
Software in a manner which would require that such software be disclosed or
distributed in source code form or made available at no charge. As used in
this  _Section 4.13(m)_ , "Public Software" means any software that (i)
contains, or is derived in any manner (in whole or in part) from, any software
that is distributed as free software, open source software (e.g., Linux) or
(ii) requires as a condition of its use, modification or distribution that it
be disclosed or distributed in source code form or made available at no
charge. Public Software includes without limitation software licensed under
the GNUs General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL, the Mozilla
Public License, the Netscape Public License, the Sun Community Source License,
the Sun Industry Standards License, the BSD License, and the Apache License.

shall be in material compliance with, all Applicable Law.



(b) All materials, products and services distributed or marketed by the

has made all material filings with, government (and quasi-governmental)
agencies and authorities, that are necessary and/or legally required to be
held by it to conduct the Company Business without any violation of Applicable
Law ("Governmental Permits"), and all such material Governmental Permits are
valid and in full force and effect. The Company has not received any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Authority regarding (i) any actual
or possible violation of law or any Governmental Permit or any failure to
comply with any term or requirement of any Governmental Permit or (ii) any
actual or possible revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation,
termination or modification of any Governmental Permit.



(d) Neither the Company, nor to the Companys knowledge, any director,
officer or employee of the Company has, for or on behalf of the Company, (i)
used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other
unlawful expenses relating to political activity, (ii) made any
unlawful payment to foreign or domestic government officials or employees or
to foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns or violated any
provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or (iii)
made any other payment in violation of Applicable Law.



 

46 4.15 _Certain Transactions and Agreements_. None of the officers, directors or
employees of the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, none of
stockholders of the Company or the immediate family members of an officer,
director, employee or stockholder of the Company, has any direct ownership
interest in any firm or corporation that competes with, or does business
with, or has any contractual arrangement with, the Company (except with
respect to any interest in less than 1% of the stock of any corporation whose

4.16 _Employees, ERISA and Other Compliance_.



(a) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable
Law and Contracts relating to employment, employment practices, immigration,
wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, including employee
compensation matters, and has correctly classified employees as exempt
employees and nonexempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. A
complete list of all employees, officers and consultants of the Company and
their current title and/or job description, compensation (base compensation
and bonuses) and benefits is set forth on _Schedule 4.16(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. All employees of the Company are legally permitted to be
employed by the Company in the jurisdiction in which such employee is employed
in their current job capacities for the maximum period allowed under
Applicable Law. All independent contractors providing services to the Company
have been properly classified as independent contractors for purposes of
federal and applicable state tax laws, laws applicable to employee benefits
and other Applicable Law. The Company does not have any employment or
consulting Contracts currently in effect that are not terminable at will
(other than agreements with the sole purpose of providing for the
confidentiality of proprietary information or assignment of inventions).



(b) The Company (i) is not now, and has never been, subject to a union
organizing effort, (ii) is not subject to any collective bargaining agreement
with respect to any of its employees, (iii) is not subject to any other
Contract with any trade or labor union, employees association or
similar organization, and (iv) has no current material labor disputes. The

contemplated hereby shall have a material adverse effect on such labor
relations, and has no knowledge that any of its key employees intends to leave
their employ.



(c) The Company does not maintain or contribute to, nor has it ever maintained
or contributed to, any "pension plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA.



 

47 (d) (i) _Schedule 4.16(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each
employment, consulting, severance or other similar Contract, each "employee
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and each plan or arrangement
(written or oral) providing for insurance coverage (including any self-insured
arrangements that are clearly identified as such), workers benefits,
vacation benefits, severance benefits, disability benefits, death benefits,
hospitalization benefits, retirement benefits, deferred compensation, profit-
sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock
appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement

that is entered into, maintained or contributed to by the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate and covers any employee or former employee of the Company.
Such Contracts, plans and arrangements as are described in this _Section
4.16(d)_ are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Company
Benefit Arrangements".



(ii) Each Company Benefit Arrangement has been maintained in compliance in
all material respects with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all Applicable Law that is applicable to such Company Benefit
Arrangement. Each such Company Benefit Arrangement that is an "employee
pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA that is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified. Unless otherwise
indicated in _Schedule 4.16(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, with
respect to each such Company Benefit Arrangement that is an "employee pension
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code, the Company (1) has received a favorable
opinion, advisory, notification and/or determination letter, as applicable,
that such plan satisfied the requirements of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act,
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the
Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997
(collectively referred to as "GUST"), the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the IRS
Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 and the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act
of 2000 (a copy of which letter(s) have been delivered to Acquiror and its
counsel), and nothing has occurred since the issuance of such opinion,
advisory, notification and/or determination letter, as applicable, which would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of such
Company Benefit Arrangement, (2) the Company has applied timely to the
Internal Revenue Service for such letter, (3) the Company has a remaining
period of time to apply for such letter, or (4) if reliance is permitted
under IRS Announcement 2001-77, the Company relies on the favorable opinion
letter or advisory letter of the master and prototype or volume submitter plan
sponsor of such Employee Plan. No Company Benefit Arrangement shall be
subject to any surrender fees or services fees upon termination other than the
normal and reasonable administrative fees associated with the termination of
benefit plans. No employee of the Company and no person subject to any health
plan of the Company has made medical claims through any such health plan
during the 12 months preceding the Agreement Date for more than $25,000 in the
aggregate for which the Company is responsible. For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, any exception to such representation and warranty set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be stated generally and shall not identify any
employee of the Company or person subject to any health plan of the Company
who has made medical claims.

 



(iii) The Company has delivered to Acquiror and its legal counsel a complete

other employee communications, summary plan descriptions, summary of
material modifications and other authorizing documents applicable to any
Company Benefit Arrangement.

counsel the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) and all schedules
attached thereto for each Company Benefit Arrangement that is subject to ERISA
and Code reporting requirements, and all material written communications with
participants, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor or
any other Governmental Authority, administrators, trustees, beneficiaries and
alternate payees relating to any Company Benefit Arrangement.



(v) No suit, administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been
brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened in writing against
or with respect to any Company Benefit Arrangement, including any audit or
inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Department of Labor. The
Company has never been a participant in any "prohibited transaction" within
the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code with respect
to any employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA)
that the Company sponsors as employer or in which the Company participates as
an employer which was not otherwise exempt pursuant to Section 408 of ERISA
(including any individual exemption granted under Section 408(a) of ERISA) or
that could result in an excise tax under the Code or the assessment of a civil
penalty under Section 502(i) of ERISA against the Company.



(vi) All contributions due from the Company with respect to any of the
Company Benefit Arrangements have been made or have been accrued on the
Companys financial statements (including the Company Financial Statements),
and no further contributions shall be due or shall have accrued thereunder as
of the Closing Date (other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practices, after the Balance Sheet Date as a
result of the operations of the Company after the Balance Sheet Date). All
contributions due from the Company with respect to any Company Benefit
Arrangement qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a Code
Section 401(k) cash or deferred arrangement have been timely made. All claims
as of the Closing Date made under any self-insured Company Benefit Arrangement
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
will have been paid by the Company as of the Closing Date.

 



(vii) All individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any Company Benefit
Arrangement, are entitled to participate in any Company Benefit Arrangement,
are currently participating in such Company Benefit Arrangement or have been
offered an opportunity to do so and have declined in writing.



(viii) The Company shall not have any Liability to any employee or to any
organization or any other entity as a result of the termination of any
employee leasing arrangement.



(e) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Arrangement that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Benefit
Arrangement above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof during
the calendar year 2003.



 

49 (f) Each Company Benefit Arrangement, to the extent applicable, is in
compliance, in all material respects, with the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA,
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, and the regulations
thereunder, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,
as amended, the Womens Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, and the Family
Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, and the regulations thereunder, as such
requirements affect the Company and its employees. There are no outstanding,
uncorrected violations under the Consolidation Omnibus Budget Reconciliation

such Foreign Plan is in material compliance with the provisions of the laws of
each jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent

any, that such Foreign Plan is in compliance with the laws of the relevant
jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to give effect to
such Foreign Plan, (iv) such Foreign Plan has been administered in all
material respects at all times in accordance with its terms and applicable law
and regulations, (v) to the knowledge of the Company, there are no pending

of such Foreign Plan), suits or proceedings against such Foreign Plan or
asserting any rights or claims to benefits under such Foreign Plan, (vi) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by
itself create or otherwise result in any liability with respect to such
Foreign Plan other than the triggering of payment to participants, and (vii)
except as required by applicable laws, no condition exists that would prevent
the Company from terminating or amending any Foreign Plan at any time for any
reason in accordance with the terms of each such Foreign Plan (other than
normal and reasonable expenses typically incurred in a termination event) The

for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary in the United States.

Agreements and the Merger Sub Ancillary Agreements.

such documents as soon as practicable). Except for the delivery of
the Informational Documents in accordance with the terms hereof, the Company
shall not, and shall cause each Company Representative (as defined in _Section

Company Capital Stock and/or  



 

58  Company Options in connection with the Merger in violation of any applicable
federal or state securities laws.



(d) _Amendment of Hearing Materials_. Each of the Company and Acquiror shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the information relating to the
Company and Acquiror included in the Hearing Notice, the Permit Application
and the Informational Documents to not, at the time the Hearing Notice
is delivered to holders of the Company Capital Stock and/or Company Options,
at the time the Informational Documents are delivered to holders of the
Company Capital Stock and/or Company Options and at all times subsequent
thereto (through and including the Effective Time of the First Merger),
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company shall promptly advise Acquiror, and Acquiror shall
promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective
Time of the First Merger either the Company or Acquiror shall
obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to
amend or supplement the Hearing Notice, the Permit Application, and/or the
Informational Documents, in order to make the statements contained or
incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable
law. The Company and Acquiror shall cooperate in delivering any such amendment

Consideration, First Booking Stock Earnout and all Subsequent Booking Stock
Earnouts) are issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Act, by reason of Section 3(a)(10) thereof pursuant to this
_Section 6.1(a)_ , Acquiror will be authorized to give stop transfer
instructions to its transfer agent with respect to any Acquiror Common Stock
received pursuant to the Merger by any Affiliate of the Company for purposes
of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act (regardless of whether such
Persons name appears on _Schedule 4.17_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) and
there will be placed on the certificates representing such Acquiror Common
Stock, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance that the
shares were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act applies and may only be transferred in conformity with Rule
145. In addition, Acquiror may cause to be placed on the certificates
representing Acquiror Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger as Initial
Stock Consideration or First Booking Stock Earnout to all Company Stockholders
such legends as are necessary to reflect such other restrictions, if
applicable, as shall be set forth in the Company Stockholder Agreement.
Following the expiration of restrictions imposed by applicable federal and
state securities laws and such Company Stockholder Agreement, Acquiror will
use its reasonable best efforts to assist the former Company Stockholders in
the removal of restrictive legends and issuance of unlegended stock
certifications in connection with their interactions with Acquirors transfer
agent and brokers which process trades in Acquiror Common Stock.



 

59 6.2 _Private Placement_.



(a) _Alternative to Fairness Hearing_. In the event that (i) Acquiror and the
Company agree not to file or proceed with the Permit Application (either
prior to or after the filing of the Permit Application), (ii) Acquiror
determines after consultation with the Company that the Permit cannot be
obtained, or cannot reasonably be expected to be obtained, in time to permit
the Closing to occur on or before April 30, 2004, or (iii) if the California
Commissioner notifies Acquiror or the Company of the California Commissioners
determination not to grant the Hearing, not to permit the mailing of the
Notice of Hearing and/or not to issue the Permit (or that any of the foregoing
will be conditioned upon a material alteration to the terms of this Agreement,
any exhibit or schedule hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby), then Acquiror shall issue the Acquiror Common Stock issued in the
Merger (including the Initial Stock Consideration, First Booking Stock Earnout
and all Subsequent Booking Stock Earnouts) in a private placement pursuant to
an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act in accordance with
this _Section 6.2(a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror shall not elect
or be required to issue the shares pursuant to this _Section 6.2(a)_ if
Acquiror shall determine in its good faith judgment after consultation with
legal counsel that the issuance of the shares cannot be completed in
compliance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act. Acquiror shall prepare, with the
cooperation of Company, an information statement to effect such private
placement (the "Information Statement"). Each of the Company and Acquiror
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Information Statement to
comply with all requirements of Applicable Law (including federal and state
securities laws and the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder). Each of
the Company and Acquiror shall provide promptly to the other such information
concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as, in the
reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any amendments
or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate
with the others counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Information
Statement. The Information Statement shall constitute a disclosure document
for the offer and issuance of the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be
received by the holders of the Company Capital Stock and/or Company Options in
the Merger and a proxy statement for solicitation of Company Stockholder
approval of the Merger. The Company shall, within 10 business days of
notification by Acquiror that it is necessary to proceed with a private
placement, mail the Information Statement to all stockholders of the Company
entitled to vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger and all holders of Company Options. Whenever any event occurs that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information
Statement, the Company and Acquiror shall cooperate in delivering any such
amendment or supplement to all the Company Stockholders and all holders of
Company Options. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding,
the Company shall not include in the Information Statement any information
with respect to Acquiror or its affiliates or associates, the form and content
of which information shall not have been approved by Acquiror prior to such
inclusion; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror shall not delay, condition
or withhold approval of any information required to be included by federal or
state law. Except for the delivery of the Information Statement in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Company shall not, and shall cause each
Company Representative not to, directly or indirectly, solicit the vote of
any holder of the Company Capital Stock and/or Company Options in connection
with the Merger by means of any general advertising or general solicitation or
otherwise in violation of any applicable federal or state securities laws.
Each of the Company  



 

60  and Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the information
relating to the Company and Acquiror in the Information Statement to not, at
the time the Information Statement is delivered to holders of the Company
Capital Stock and/or Company Options and at all times subsequent thereto
(through and including the Effective Time of the First Merger), contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Company shall promptly advise Acquiror, and Acquiror shall
promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective
Time of the First Merger either the Company or Acquiror shall obtain knowledge
of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend
or supplement the Information Statement, in order to make the statements
contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply
with Applicable Law. The Company and Acquiror shall cooperate in delivering
any such amendment or supplement to all the Company Stockholders and all
holders of Company Options.



(b) _Restrictive Legends_. In the event the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to
be issued in connection with the Merger are issued in a transaction exempt
from registration under the Securities Act, by reason of Section 4(2) thereof
and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ , such
shares may not be re-offered or resold other than in conformity with the
registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and other
applicable state blue sky securities laws and regulations or pursuant to an
exemption therefrom. The certificates issued by Acquiror with respect to the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued hereunder shall, if issued pursuant to
_Section 6.2(a)_ , be legended to as necessary to comply with applicable
federal and state securities laws and such other restrictions, if applicable,
as shall be set forth in a Stockholder Representation Agreement in customary
form executed by Company Stockholders in favor of Acquiror. Following the
expiration of restrictions imposed by applicable federal and state securities
laws and such Stockholder Representation Agreement, Acquiror will use its
reasonable best efforts to assist the former Company Stockholders in the
removal of restrictive legends and issuance of unlegended stock certifications
in connection with their interactions with Acquirors transfer agent and
brokers which process trades in Acquiror Common Stock.



(c) _Form S-3 Registration_. If the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger are issued pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ and Acquiror is
obligated to issue any Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout pursuant to _Article
3_ , then: (1) Acquiror shall prepare and file a registration statement on
Form S-3 (or any successor registration form under the Securities Act
subsequently adopted by the SEC or other available form under the
Securities Act for the resale of securities) with the SEC covering the resale
of only shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in connection with the Merger
as a Subsequent Booking Stock Earnout (and not as Initial Stock Consideration
or First Booking Stock Earnout) within 30 calendar days after the issuance of
such shares (assuming timely receipt of the Spreadsheet, all information
relating to the Effective Time Holders for inclusion in such registration
statement, and all signatures, opinions and consents required for such
registration statement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror may in its
sole discretion register for resale on such Form S-3 additional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with the Merger
(whether previously issued as Initial Stock Consideration or First Booking
Stock Earnout or subject to future issuance as Subsequent Booking Stock
Earnouts for subsequent periods); (2) Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
 



 

61  efforts to cause such registration statement(s) to become effective as
promptly as practicable after filing and to keep such registration
statement(s) effective until one year after the Effective Time of the First
Merger; and (3) Acquiror and the Effective Time Holders will enter into a
registration rights agreement containing customary provisions, including
customary Silicon Valley venture-backed company cross-indemnification
provisions.



6.3 _Blue Sky Laws_. Acquiror shall take such steps as may be necessary to
comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are
applicable to the issuance of the Acquiror Common Stock in connection with the
Merger. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Acquiror
as may be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all
jurisdictions which are applicable in connection with the issuance of Acquiror
Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

join in the execution and filing of, any application, notification or other
document that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval
or consent of any Governmental Authority, whether federal, state, local

reasonably request, in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Company Ancillary
Agreement. The Company shall use diligent efforts to obtain, and to cooperate
with Acquiror to promptly obtain, all such authorizations, approvals and
consents and shall pay any associated filing fees payable by the Company with
respect to such authorizations, approvals and consents. The Company shall
promptly inform Acquiror of any material communication between the Company and
any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. If the Company or any affiliate of the Company receives any formal or
informal request for supplemental information or documentary material from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
then the Company shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as  



 

65  reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request. The
Company shall direct, in its sole discretion, the making of such response, but
shall consider in good faith the views of the Acquiror.

to promptly obtain such written consents and authorizations of third parties,

Corporation (or Acquiror) to carry on the Company Business immediately after

solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or take any other action that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) consider
or entertain any correspondence or communications received from any Person
concerning any Acquisition Proposal (other than to respond to such

communications concerning any Acquisition Proposal (other than to respond to
such correspondence or communications by indicating that Company is not
interested in or cannot freely discuss any Acquisition Proposal); (iv) enter
into, participate in, maintain or continue any discussions or negotiations

inquiries or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal; (v) cooperate with,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to effect any
Acquisition Proposal; (vi) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal; or (vii) execute, enter into or become bound by any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding or similar document or any Contract that
provides for, contemplates, concerns or otherwise relates to any Acquisition
Proposal. If any Company Representative, whether in his or her capacity
as such or in any other capacity, takes any action that the Company is
obligated pursuant to this _Section 7.7(a)_ to cause such Company
Representative not to take, then the Company shall be deemed for all purposes
of this Agreement to have breached this _Section 7.7(a)_ , and the Company
agrees, at its sole expense, to take all  



 

66  reasonable measures (including without limitation court proceedings) to
restrain the Company Representatives from taking any such prohibited
actions. 



(b) _Notification to Acquiror_. The Company shall (i) immediately notify
Acquiror after receipt by the Company (or, to the Companys knowledge, by any
of the Company Representatives) of any correspondence or communication that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, or any other notice that any Person is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company or for access to any of the properties, books or records of the
Company by any Person or Persons other than Acquiror (or its and its agents
and advisors), which notice shall identify the Person or Persons making, or
considering making, such Acquisition Proposal or request for information or
access, (ii) shall keep Acquiror fully informed as promptly as practicable of
the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal (including amendments
or proposed amendments) or request for information or access and any
correspondence or communications related thereto, and (iii) shall provide to
Acquiror a correct and complete copy of such Acquisition Proposal or request
for information or access and any amendments, correspondence and
communications related thereto (if in writing) or a written summary thereof
(if not in writing). The Company shall provide Acquiror with 48 hours prior
notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Board
of Directors of the Company) of any meeting of the Board of Directors of the
Company at which the Board of Directors of the Company is reasonably expected
to consider any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated (and
shall not resume or otherwise continue) any and all existing activities,
discussions and negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.



7.8 _Access to Information_. The Company, upon reasonable notice, shall allow
Acquiror and its agents and advisors access at reasonable times to the files,
books, records, technology, Contracts, personnel and offices of the Company,
including any and all information relating to the Companys taxes, Contracts,
Liabilities, financial condition and real, personal and intangible property,
subject to the terms of the Nondisclosure Letter Agreement between the Company
and Acquiror (the "Mutual NDA") and provided that such access shall not
unreasonably disrupt the Companys normal business activities. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants to cooperate
with Acquiror and Acquirors agents and advisors (provided that, prior to any
disclosure to such agents or advisors, such agents or advisors are bound by
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with substantially similar
restrictions as included in the Mutual NDA to restrict the use and disclosure
of the Companys confidential information) in making available all
financial information reasonably requested by Acquiror and its agents and
advisors, including the right to examine all working papers pertaining to all
financial statements prepared or audited by such accountants.



7.9 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article 10_ , and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. The Company will withhold for all income and employment-
related taxes imposed in connection with the exercises of Company Options
described in _Section 2.4(b)(ii)_. 



 

67 7.10 _Company Benefit Arrangements_. Upon Acquirors request, the Company
shall terminate any Company Benefit Arrangement and any employee leasing
arrangement or professional employee organization prior to the Closing Date.
All participants and former participants in any Company Benefit Arrangement
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) shall become fully vested in their account balances under such employee
pension benefit plan to the extent required by Applicable Law. The Company
shall terminate any and all group severance, separation, retention and salary
continuation plans, programs or arrangements (other than Contracts disclosed
in writing to Acquiror prior to the Agreement Date and listed on _Schedule
7.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) prior to the Closing Date.



7.11 _Approval of the Company Stockholders_.



(a) _Stockholder Meeting or Consent_. The Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with this Agreement, Delaware Law, and the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company to (i) call, notice, convene, hold
and conduct a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") for the purpose of voting upon approval of the Merger and adoption
of this Agreement or (ii) secure the written consent of the Company
Stockholders approving the Merger and adopting this Agreement (the "Company
Stockholders Consent"). The Company shall hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting or secure the Company Stockholders Consent as soon as practicable (and
in any event no later than 10 business days) after the date the California
Commissioner issues the Permit or, in the event that Acquiror proceeds with
the private placement pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ , as soon as practicable
after Acquiror notifies the Company of such fact. If the Company will call
the Company Stockholders Meeting, then the Company shall consult with Acquiror
regarding the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not postpone
or adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum and postponements and
adjournments not to exceed five business days in the aggregate necessary for
the sole purpose of obtaining additional votes in order to obtain the
requisite vote of the Company Stockholders necessary to approve the Merger and
adopt this Agreement) the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Acquiror. If the Company will call the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
Company Stockholders proxies to be voted on the approval of the Merger and
adoption of this Agreement. The Companys obligation to call, give notice of,
convene, hold and conduct the Company Stockholders Meeting or secure the
Company Stockholders Consent in accordance with this _Section 7.11(a)_ shall
not be limited to or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission to Company of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall exercise reasonable best efforts to take all other action necessary
to secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders required to effect
each of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) _Board Recommendation_. In the Informational Documents or Information
Statement, as applicable, the Companys Board of Directors shall make a
unanimous, unqualified recommendation that the Company Stockholders vote in
favor of adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or pursuant to the Company Stockholders Consent
and state that the Board of Directors has concluded that the terms and
conditions of the Merger and this Agreement are fair, just, reasonable,
equitable, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
securityholders. Neither the Companys Board of  



 

68  Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to
Acquiror, the unanimous recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors
that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger.



(c) _Parachute Payment Waivers_. The Company shall obtain and deliver to
Acquiror, prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval
procedure under _Section 7.11(d)_ , a Parachute Payment Waiver, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, from each Person who the Company or
Acquiror reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company and/or any ERISA
Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined
immediately prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval
procedure under _Section 7.11(d)_ , and who Acquiror believes might otherwise
receive, have received, or have the right or entitlement to receive a
parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code.



(d) _280G Stockholder Approval_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, at the Company Stockholders Meeting or, if the Company
Stockholders Meeting has not been and will not be held, concurrently with
securing the Company Stockholders Consent, the approval by such number
of stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all payments and/or benefits
provided pursuant to Contracts or arrangements that, in the absence of the
executed Parachute Payment Waivers by the affected Persons under _Section
7.11(c)_ , might otherwise result, separately or in the aggregate, in the
payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit that would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code, with such stockholder
approval to be obtained in a manner which satisfies all applicable
requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the
proposed Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1
of such proposed Treasury Regulations.



7.12 _Notices to Company Securityholders and Employees_.



(a) The Company shall timely provide to holders of Company Capital Stock and
Company Options all advance notices required to be given to such holders in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the Company Option Plan or other applicable Contracts.



(b) The Company shall give all notices and other information required to be
given to the employees of the Company and any applicable Governmental
Authority under the Code, COBRA and other Applicable Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other applicable Contracts.

ARTICLE 8

ACQUIROR COVENANTS



During the time period from the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of
(a) the Effective Time of the First Merger or (b) the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of _Article 11_ , Acquiror
covenants and agrees with the Company as follows:



8.1 _Advice of Changes_. Acquiror shall promptly advise the Company in writing
of (a) any event occurring subsequent to the Agreement Date that would render
any representation or warranty of Acquiror contained in _Article 5_ untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in _Section 9.1_ would not be
satisfied and (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Acquiror
pursuant to this Agreement or any Acquiror Ancillary Agreement such that the
condition set forth in _Section 9.2_ would not be satisfied.



8.2 _Regulatory Approvals_. Acquiror shall promptly execute and file, or join
in the execution and filing of, any application, notification or
other document that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization,
approval or consent of any Governmental Authority, whether foreign, federal,
state, local or municipal, which may be reasonably required in connection with
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any Acquiror Ancillary Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary
Agreement. Acquiror shall use diligent efforts to obtain all such
authorizations, approvals and consents and shall pay any associated filing
fees payable by Acquiror with respect to such authorizations, approvals and
consents. Acquiror shall promptly inform the Company of any material
communication between Acquiror and any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. If Acquiror or any affiliate of
Acquiror receives any formal or informal request for supplemental information
or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, then Acquiror shall make, or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such
request. Acquiror shall direct, in its sole discretion, the making of such
response, but shall consider in good faith the views of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
in writing to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Applicable Law, it is expressly understood
and agreed that neither Acquiror nor any of its  



 

70  Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be under any obligation to: (a) litigate or
contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent; or (b) make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit
to orders providing for (i) the sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Acquiror, any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or the
Company, or the holding separate of the shares of Company Capital Stock or
(ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability of Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries or affiliates to freely conduct their business or own such
assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the shares
of Company Capital Stock.



8.3 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Acquiror shall use its reasonable
best efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions
precedent that are set forth in _Article 9_ , and Acquiror shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.



Acquiror also covenants and agrees with the Company as follows:



8.4 _Employee Benefit Matters_.



(a) _Acquiror Plans_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time of the First Merger, Acquirer shall enroll those persons who
were employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
First Merger and who become employees of the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror
following the Effective Time of the First Merger ("Continuing Employees") in
Acquirors employee benefit plans for which such employees are eligible (the
"Acquiror Plans"), to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable
Acquiror Plans on substantially similar terms applicable to employees of
Acquiror who are similarly situated based on levels of responsibility.
Acquiror shall recognize the prior service with the Company of each of the
Continuing Employees in connection with Acquirors PTO plan, for purposes of
eligibility and levels of benefits, but only to the extent permitted by the
terms of such plan. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 8.4_ to the
contrary, this _Section 8.4_ shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or to fund any such benefit.



(b) _Company Employee Bonus Program_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing, Acquiror shall establish a bonus pool for Continuing
Employees and new hires (who are hired for the Company Business pursuant to
the Operating Plan) consisting of $10,000,000 in cash, to be awarded to such
employees (who remain employed by Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation at the
time of grant) during the period from Closing through March 31, 2009. The
amount and timing of awards to individual employees will be determined in
good faith by Acquiror and the Representative. Any awards made pursuant to the
bonus program which are forfeited due to termination of employment of a
recipient will be reallocated to the bonus program for future distribution on
the terms set forth above.



 

71 8.5 _Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers_.



(a) _Indemnification_. If the First Merger is consummated, then until the
fourth anniversary of the Effective Time of the First Merger, Acquiror will,
and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former directors and officers of the Company (the "Company
Indemnified Parties") in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date to the extent provided under written indemnification
agreements with such individuals and the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, in each case as in effect as of the date hereof
and Applicable Law, and shall not for a period of four years after the
Effective Time of the First Merger, take any action to change in a manner
adverse to the former directors and officers of the Company any exculpatory,
indemnification or reimbursement provisions now existing in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or written indemnification agreement
for the benefit of any individual who served as a director or officer of the
Company at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, except for any changes
which may be required to conform with changes in Applicable Law or any changes
which do not affect the application of such provisions to acts or omissions
of such individuals prior to the Closing Date. The provisions of this _Section
8.5(a)_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each such Company Indemnified Party. No payments by Acquiror of any amounts
in satisfaction of its indemnification obligations under this _Section 8.5(a)_
will be considered Damages for purposes of _Article 12_ (and shall not be
considered a Claim for indemnification under _Article 12_ ), unless
any Company Indemnified Party is finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (without right of appeal) not to have been entitled to such
indemnification, and then only to the extent that any such Company Indemnified
Party has not reimbursed Acquiror for the expenses of such indemnification
advanced on his behalf.



(b) _Defense Obligations_. From the Agreement Date until the fourth
anniversary of the Effective Time of the First Merger, Acquiror hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Companys current directors and officers
with respect to any defense costs, liabilities or judgments incurred by any of
them arising from any litigation or other proceeding initiated after the
execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing by any
stockholder, equity holder or potential third-party acquiror in which any
such party: (i) seeks to challenge, question, enjoin or otherwise delay the
Merger, this Agreement or the Voting Agreements executed in connection with
this Agreement (or seeks monetary damages in lieu thereof) or (ii) makes a
claim that approval of this Agreement by the Companys Board of Directors or
any other activity of the Companys officers and directors in connection
therewith was in any respect improper ("Merger Litigation"). Acquiror further
agrees to advance any reasonable expenses incurred by the Companys directors
and officers in connection with any Merger Litigation. No amounts incurred or
paid by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 8.5(b)_ shall be considered
Damages for purposes of _Article 12_ (and shall not be considered a Claim for
indemnification under _Article 12_ ). In the event of the commencement of any
Merger Litigation, Acquiror will work in good faith with Company and
Companys Board of Directors to attempt to defend, resolve or settle the
Merger Litigation, including without limitation by negotiating amendments to
this Agreement as may be mutually agreed upon, if and to the extent necessary
to resolve or settle the Merger Litigation. The provisions of this _Section
8.5(b)_ shall immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect upon
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 11_. 



 

72 (c) _Limitations_. The foregoing covenants under this _Section 8.5_ shall
not apply to (i) any claim or matter that relates to a willful material
breach of a covenant made by the Company in this Agreement (including without
limitation _Section 7.7_ (No Other Negotiations)) or made by a Company
Stockholder in connection with the Voting Agreement or (ii) any claim based
on a claim for indemnification made by an Acquiror Indemnified Person pursuant
to _Article 12_. In the event of breach of the representation set forth in
_Section 4.6(b)_ , this _Section 8.5_ shall be terminated with respect to any
claim required to be, but not, disclosed in _Schedule 4.6(b)_. The
effectiveness of the foregoing covenants under this _Section 8.5_ is
conditioned upon the receipt from Company Stockholders holding at least 95%
of the Company Common Stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger (including Company Common Stock issued upon
conversion of Company Series A Stock and exercise of Company Options
before the Effective Time of the First Merger) of the releases of liability
described in _Section 10.12_.



8.6 _NASDAQ Listing_. Acquiror shall authorize for listing on the NASDAQ
National Market the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued in connection with
the Merger (including the Initial Stock Consideration, the First Booking Stock
Earnout and all Subsequent Booking Stock Earnouts).



8.7 _Post-Closing Tax Matters_.



(a) Acquiror shall, at its own expense, prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, all Returns (including in Acquirors discretion any
amended Returns as need to be filed) of the Company for all taxable periods
ending on or prior to the Effective Time that have not been filed as of the
Effective Time and for all taxable periods that include the Effective Time
(the "Overlap Returns"). Thirty days prior to the due date for any Overlap
Return or the filing date of any amended Overlap Return, Acquiror will provide
to the Representative, for his review, a copy of such Overlap Return (which
shall be prepared by a national accounting firm), and Acquiror shall
incorporate thereon reasonable comments consistent with applicable tax laws
timely provided in writing by the Representative.



(b) Acquiror will own all outstanding stock of Auto Merger Sub immediately
after the Merger and Acquiror has no current plan or intention to and will not
cause or permit Auto Merger Sub to issue additional equity interests to any
person or entity (other than Acquiror) in connection with the
Merger. Immediately after the Merger, Auto Merger Sub will not have any
outstanding warrants, options, convertible securities or any other type of
right pursuant to which any person could acquire equity interests in Auto
Merger Sub and Acquiror will not cause or permit Auto Merger Sub to issue any
such rights in connection with the Merger.



(c) Assuming the current business carried on by the Company is the "historic
business," following the Merger, Auto Merger Sub will continue the Companys
historic business or use a significant portion of the Companys historic
business assets in a business within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.368-1(d).



(d) In connection with the Merger, Acquiror will not redeem or reacquire any
shares of the Acquiror Common Stock issued in the First Merger. In addition,
in connection with the Merger, no person related to Acquiror (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section  



 

73  1.368-1(e)(3)) and no person acting as an intermediary for Acquiror or such
a related person will acquire any of the Acquiror Common Stock issued in
the First Merger. Acquiror may repurchase Unvested Acquiror Shares upon the
termination of employment or services pursuant to repurchase options, vesting
schedules or other conditions assigned to Acquiror in connection with the
Merger.



(e) Acquiror will treat all of the consideration paid to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement as consideration paid to such holders
in exchange for Company Capital Stock and will not treat any portion of such
consideration as compensation for services; _provided_ , _however_ , for
any Unvested Company Shares for which a Company Stockholder has not timely
filed a valid §83(b) election under the Code, Acquiror may treat consideration
for Unvested Company Shares as paid in connection with services under §83 of
the Code when the Unvested Acquiror Shares received in exchange therefor
vest.



(f) At least 90% of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70%
of the fair market value of the gross assets held by the Company immediately
after the First Merger will be transferred to Auto Merger Sub in the Second
Merger. For purposes of this representation, the following assets will be
treated as property held by the Company immediately after the First Merger,
but not transferred to Auto Merger Sub in the Second Merger: (i) assets used
by the Company or Auto Merger Sub to pay stockholders in lieu of fractional
shares of Acquiror Common Stock or other expenses or liabilities incurred in
connection with the Merger; and (ii) assets used to make distributions,
redemptions or other payments in respect of Company Capital Stock or rights
to acquire such stock (including payments treated as such for tax purposes)
that are made after the First Merger and in contemplation of the Merger or
that are related thereto.



(g) Following the Merger, Acquiror will comply, and will cause Auto Merger
Sub to comply, with the record-keeping and information filing requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3. Acquiror, Car Merger Sub and Auto Merger
Sub will not take any position on any federal, state, or local income
or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is
inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or any of the foregoing representations,
unless otherwise required to do so by Applicable Law or if due to the
operation of _Section 3.3_ Acquiror distributes cash in connection with the
Merger that causes the Merger to fail to so qualify as a reorganization.

time prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written consent of Acquiror and
the Company.



 

79 11.2 _Unilateral Termination_.



(a) Either Acquiror or the Company, by giving written notice to the other, may
terminate this Agreement if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree
or ruling or taken any other action, in each case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or any
other material transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

terminate this Agreement if the First Merger shall not have been consummated
by midnight Pacific Time on April 30, 2004; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.2(b)_ shall
not be available to any party whose material breach of a representation or
warranty or covenant made under this Agreement by such party results in the
failure of any condition set forth in _Article 9_ or _Article 10_ to be
fulfilled or satisfied on or before such date; _provided_ _further_ , that in
the event that: (i) any such condition in _Article 10_ is not satisfied due
to the commencement after the Agreement Date of any litigation against the
Company or any of its employees that is brought by a third party that is
unaffiliated with the Company or the receipt by the Company after the
Agreement Date of written notice that such a third party intends to commence
(or that such third party believes it has a basis to commence) such
litigation; and (ii) the Company (x) promptly communicates to Acquiror in
writing such litigation or threat and the underlying facts and documentation
reasonably necessary for an evaluation of the alleged merits thereof and
defenses thereto (provided such communication does not violate or waive the
attorney client privilege), and (y) thereafter continuously works in good
faith with the Acquiror, and exercises reasonable efforts, to defend, resolve
or settle such litigation or threat (to the extent that the Company has
adequate resources to do so); but (iii) such litigation or threat cannot be
dismissed or resolved by April 30, 2004 and Acquiror has not waived each such
closing condition with respect to such litigation or threat on or prior to
that date, then the foregoing proviso shall not prohibit the Company from
terminating this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.2(b)_ following April
30, 2004.

prior to the Effective Time if (a) the other has committed a breach of (i) any
of its representations and warranties under _Article 4_  or _Article 5_ , as

cure period shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by its
nature cannot be cured) and (b) if not cured on or prior to the Closing Date,
such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Article 10_ or _Article 9_ , as applicable, to be fulfilled or satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 11.2(c)_ shall not be available to a party if the party is at that
time in material breach of this Agreement.



(d) Either Acquiror or the Company, by giving written notice to the other,
may terminate this Agreement if any required approval of the Company
Stockholders approving the Merger and adopting this Agreement shall not have
been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a vote
held at a duly noticed and held meeting of stockholders (or  



 

80  at any adjournment thereof) or by written consent of the stockholders within
10 business days following the date the California Commissioner issues
the Permit (or, in the event that Acquiror proceeds with the private
placement pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ , following the date Acquiror notifies
the Company of such fact); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.2(d)_ shall not be available
to the Company where the failure to obtain stockholder approval shall have
been caused by the action or failure to act of the Company and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach by the Company of this Agreement.

have resolved to do any of the foregoing, (ii) the Company shall have
breached or be deemed to have breached _Section 7.7_ (No Other Negotiations),

and adoption of this Agreement) or secure the Company Stockholders Consent
within 10 business days following the date the California Commissioner
issues the Permit (or, in the event that Acquiror elects to proceed with the

as provided in _Section 11.2_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror, Car Merger

12.1 _Survival_. If the First Merger is consummated, the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement and the

seek recovery of Damages arising out of a failure of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in _Section 4.13_ (Intellectual Property);
 



 

81   _provided_ _further_ , that no right to indemnification pursuant to
_Article 12_ in respect of any claim based upon any failure of
a representation or warranty that is set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered

expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. If the First Merger is
consummated, the representations and warranties of Acquiror contained in this

_however_ , that no right to indemnification pursuant to _Article 12_ in
respect of any claim based upon any breach of a covenant by the Company that
is set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered prior to the first anniversary of
the Effective Time of the First Merger shall be affected by the expiration of
such covenant.



12.2 _Agreement to Indemnify_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article 12_ , from and after the Effective Time of the First Merger, each
Effective Time Holder shall severally (based on each such holders Pro Rata
Share), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror and its
officers, directors, agents, representatives, stockholders and employees, and
each person, if any, who controls or may control Acquiror within the meaning
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each hereinafter referred to
individually as an "Acquiror Indemnified Person" and collectively as

damages, Liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
other professionals and experts fees, costs of investigation and court
costs), calculated net of actual recoveries under existing insurance policies
(net of any applicable collection costs and reserves, deductibles, premium
adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums) (in each case excluding lost
profits) (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Damages"), arising from
assessments, claims, demands, assertions of liability, or actual or threatened
actions, suits or proceedings (whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative)directly or indirectly arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with: (i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter (including all
schedules to such letter) or the Disclosure Letter Update (including all
schedules to such update) to be true and correct as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date (as though such representation
or warranty were made as of the Closing Date, except in the case of
representations and warranties which by their terms speak only as of a
specific date or dates); (ii) any failure of any certification made by the
Company in any certificate delivered to Acquiror pursuant _Article 10_ of
this Agreement (other than the Closing Expenses Certificate) to be true  



 

82  and correct as of the date such certificate is delivered to Acquiror; (iii)
any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or
agreements made by the Company in this Agreement; (iv) any inaccuracies in
the Closing Expenses Certificate or Spreadsheet; (v) any Indemnifiable Merger

representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.13_ (Intellectual
Property) to be true and correct as aforesaid, (iii) any inaccuracies in the
Closing Expenses Certificate or Spreadsheet, (iv) any Indemnifiable Merger

Acquiror has exhausted or made claims upon all amounts of IP Escrow Shares
and IP Escrow Cash (after taking into account all other claims for
indemnification from the IP Escrow Shares and IP Escrow Cash made by
Acquiror), recovery of first, earned but unpaid First Booking Earnout or
Subsequent Booking Earnouts (earned on or prior to, but not after, the third
anniversary of the Effective Time of the First Merger), and then, the amount
of any previously paid First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnouts
(earned and paid on or prior to, but not after, the third anniversary of the
Effective Time of the First Merger), up to the aggregate amount of $2,500,000
under this clause (z).



(b) _Earnout_. In the case of (i) fraud by the Company, (ii) any inaccuracies
in the Closing Expenses Certificate or Spreadsheet, (iii) any Indemnifiable
Merger Expenses, or (iv) any Dissenting Shares Excess Payments, after Acquiror
has exhausted or made claims upon all amounts of General Escrow Shares and
General Escrow Cash (after taking into account all other claims for
indemnification from the General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash) made
by Acquiror, each Effective Time Holder shall be liable for such holders Pro
Rata Share of the amount of any Damages resulting therefrom;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after Acquiror has exhausted or made claims upon all amounts
of General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash, the sole and exclusive
remedies under this Agreement for the matters listed in the
immediately preceding clauses (ii)-(iv) of this _Section 12.3(b)_ shall be
recovery of first, the amount of any earned but unpaid First Booking Earnout
or Subsequent Booking Earnouts (earned on or prior to, but not after, the
third anniversary of the Effective Time of the First Merger), and second,
after exhaustion of any earned but unpaid First Booking Earnout or Subsequent

First Merger); _provided_ _further_ , that in the case of fraud by the
Company, the maximum liability of an Effective Time Holder hereunder for any

83  resulting therefrom shall be such holders Pro Rata Share of the aggregate

thereof which constitute General Escrow Shares and IP Escrow Shares), Initial
Cash Consideration (including any amounts thereof which constitute General
Escrow Cash and IP Escrow Cash), First Booking Stock Earnout (including any

into escrow pursuant to this Agreement for the account of such Effective Time
Holder, or (iii) would have been distributed to such Effective Time Holder but
for exercise by Acquiror of its set off rights under this Agreement. Nothing
in this Agreement shall limit the liability of any Company Stockholder in
connection with any breach by such Person of any Voting Agreement to which it
is a party. For the avoidance of doubt, an Acquiror Indemnified Person
shall not be entitled under this _Article 12_ to recover for the exact same
Damages from more than one of the following clauses (i)-(iii): (i) the General
Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash, (ii) the IP Escrow Shares and IP Escrow
Cash, and (iii) the First Booking Earnout and/or Subsequent Booking Earnouts.
For any Claims for Damages arising under this Agreement, the Acquiror
Indemnified Persons shall have no right sue, claim, counterclaim, escrow or
offset against the Effective Time Holders or withhold distributions of
Acquiror Common Stock or cash distributable under this Agreement to the
Effective Time Holders, except (i) as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
(ii) as set forth in the Bookings Guidelines (with respect to recovery of de-
booked amounts on a Pro Rata Share basis), or (iii) for recovery of amounts
directly payable by Effective Time Holders on a Pro Rata Share basis under
_Section 12.3(a)-(b)_ which are not collectible by Acquiror after the exercise
of commercially reasonable efforts solely by way of offset against Subsequent
Booking Earnouts earned after the third anniversary of the Effective Time of
the First Merger to recover payments made to such Effective Time Holder prior
to such third anniversary.



(c) _Basket_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
Acquiror Indemnified Person may receive any recovery in respect of any claims
for indemnification that are made pursuant to clauses (i)-(ii) of _Section
12.2_ and do not involve fraud by the Company, unless and until Damages in an
aggregate amount greater than $250,000 (the "Basket") have been incurred, paid
or properly accrued, in which case the Acquiror Indemnified Persons may make
claims for indemnification for all Damages, including the amount of the
Basket. In determining the amount of any Damages in respect of the failure of
any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any particular
date, any materiality standard contained in such representation or warranty
shall be disregarded.



(d) _Satisfaction of Damages_. In making recovery for indemnification claims
for Damages against (i) the General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash,
(ii) IP Escrow Shares and IP Escrow Cash, or (iii) earned but unpaid First
Booking Earnout and Subsequent Booking Earnouts, Acquiror shall proceed
against shares of Acquiror Common Stock for 50% of the claimed Damages and
cash for 50% of the claimed Damages. For these purposes, (i) General Escrow
Shares (and any shares of Acquiror Common Stock tendered by an Effective Time
Holder in satisfaction of an indemnification claim) shall be deemed to have a
value equal to the Closing Stock Price, (ii) IP Escrow Shares shall be deemed
to have a value equal to the weighted average of the Closing Stock Price and
First Booking Stock Price, and (iii) shares of Acquiror Common Stock
attributable to earned but unpaid First Booking Stock Earnout and Subsequent
 



 

84  Booking Stock Earnout shall be deemed to have a per share value equal to the
First Booking Stock Price or the applicable Average Acquiror Stock Price for
the period ending on the trading day that is three trading days prior to the
Subsequent Booking Earnout Distribution Date, as applicable.



(e) _No Contribution_. The obligations of the Effective Time Holders under
this _Article 12_ shall not be reduced, offset, eliminated or subject to
contribution by reason of any action or inaction by the Company prior to the
Effective Time of the First Merger that contributed to any inaccuracy or
breach giving rise to such obligation, it being understood and agreed
that the Effective Time Holders, and not the Company, shall have the sole
obligation for the indemnity obligations under this _Article 12_.



12.4 _Appointment of Representative_.



(a) _Authority_. By voting in favor of the Merger or participating in the
conversion of Company Common Stock, each Effective Time Holder approves the
designation of and designates the Representative as the representative of the
Effective Time Holders and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf
of each Effective Time Holder with respect to claims for
indemnification under this _Article 12_ and the taking by the Representative
of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted
to be taken by the Representative under this Agreement, including the exercise
of the power to: (a) give and receive notices and communications to or from
Acquiror (on behalf of itself or any other Acquiror Indemnified Person)
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall be given or
received by such holders individually); (b) authorize the release or delivery
to Acquiror of General Escrow Shares, General Escrow Cash, IP Escrow Shares,
IP Escrow Cash, First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnouts in
satisfaction of indemnification claims by Acquiror or any other Acquiror
Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Article 12_ (including by not objecting
to such claims) or the forfeiture of cash otherwise issuable in lieu of
shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_ ; (c) agree to, object to, negotiate,
resolve, enter into settlements and compromises of, demand litigation of, and
comply with orders of courts with respect to, (i) indemnification claims by
Acquiror or any other Acquiror Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Article
12_ , (ii) any other claim by any Acquiror Indemnified Person, against any
such holder or by any such holder against any Acquiror Indemnified Person or
any dispute between any Acquiror Indemnified Person and any such holder (it
being understood that the Representative shall be entitled to commence
litigation on behalf of such holders to enforce Acquirors obligations
hereunder in accordance with their terms) or (iii) determination of
achievement of Technical Milestones or calculation of bookings credits, debits
or allocations, in each case relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby; and (d) take
all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. The Representative shall have authority
and power to act on behalf of each Effective Time Holder with respect to the
disposition, settlement or other handling of all claims under this _Article
12_ and all rights or obligations arising under this _Article 12_. The
Effective Time Holders shall be bound by all actions taken and documents
executed by the Representative in connection with this _Article 12_ , and
Acquiror and other Acquiror Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely on
any action or decision of the Representative. The individual serving as the
Representative may be  



 

85  replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the First Merger upon not less
than 10 days prior written notice to Acquiror. No bond shall be required of
the Representative, and the Representative shall receive no compensation for
his services. Notices or communications to or from the Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each of the Effective Time Holders.



(b) _Limitation on Liability_. In performing the functions specified in this
Agreement, the Representative shall not be liable to any Effective Time
Holder in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
the Representative. Each Effective Time Holder shall severally (based on each
such holders Pro Rata Share), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Representative from and against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder, including any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably incurred by the
Representative. If not paid directly to the Representative by the Effective
Time Holders, such losses, liabilities or expenses may be recovered by the
Representative from General Escrow Shares, General Escrow Cash, IP Escrow
Shares, IP Escrow Cash, First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnouts
(with shares valued in the manner set forth in _Section 12.3(d)_ ) otherwise
distributable to the Effective Time Holders (and not distributed or
distributable to any Acquiror Indemnified Person or subject to a pending
indemnification claim of any Acquiror Indemnified Person or consisting of
Unvested Acquiror Shares or Unvested Acquiror Cash) pursuant to the terms
hereof, at the time of distribution, and such recovery will be made from the
Effective Time Holders according to their respective Pro Rata Shares.



12.5 _Notice of Claim_. As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for
indemnification of Acquiror or any other Acquiror Indemnified Person for
Damages under this _Article 12_. Acquiror may give notice of a Claim under
this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any
other Acquiror Indemnified Person, and Acquiror shall give written notice of a
Claim executed by an officer of Acquiror (a "Notice of Claim") to the
Representative promptly after Acquiror becomes aware of the existence of any
potential claim by an Acquiror Indemnified Person for indemnification from the
Effective Time Holders under this _Article 12_ , arising from or relating to:



(a) Any matter specified in _Section 12.2_ ; or



(b) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against Acquiror or any
other Acquiror Indemnified Person of a claim, demand, suit, action,
arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party
against Acquiror or such other Acquiror Indemnified Person (in each such case,
a "Third-Party Claim") that is based on, arises out of or relates to any
matter specified in _Section 12.2_.



The period during which claims may be initiated (the "Claims Period") for
indemnification from the General Escrow Shares and General Escrow Cash
shall commence at the Effective Time of the First Merger and terminate at the
one-year anniversary of the Effective Time of the First Merger. The Claims
Period for indemnification from and against Damages arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with (i) any failure of any of the representations and
warranties  



 

86  contained in _Section 4.13_ (Intellectual Property) to be true and correct
as aforesaid, (ii) any inaccuracies in the Closing Expenses Certificate
or Spreadsheet, (iii) any Indemnifiable Merger Expenses and (iv) any
Dissenting Shares Excess Payments shall commence at the Effective Time of the
First Merger and terminate at the three-year anniversary of the Effective Time
of the First Merger. The Claims Period for indemnification from and against
Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with fraud by the
Company shall commence at the Effective Time of the First Merger and terminate
upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, any Claims for Damages specified in
any Notice of Claim delivered to the Representative prior to expiration of the
applicable Claims Period with respect to facts and circumstances existing
prior to expiration of the applicable Claims Period shall remain outstanding
until such Claims for Damages have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding
the expiration of such Claims Period. Until the expiration of the applicable
Claims Period, no delay on the part of Acquiror in giving the Representative a
Notice of Claim shall relieve the Representative or any Effective Time Holder
from any of its obligations under this _Article 12_ unless (and then only
to the extent that) the Representative or the Effective Time Holders are
materially prejudiced thereby.



12.6 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.



(a) Acquiror shall determine and conduct the defense or settlement of any
Third-Party Claim, and the costs and expenses incurred by Acquiror in
connection with such defense or settlement (including reasonable attorneys
fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs)
shall be included in the Damages for which Acquiror may seek indemnification
pursuant to a Claim made by any Acquiror Indemnified Person hereunder to the
extent provided in this _Article 12_. An Acquiror Indemnified Person shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages for which
the Effective Time Holders are obligated to provide indemnification for and
against pursuant to this _Article 12_.



(b) The Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim
to the extent that receipt of such documents by the Representative does not
affect any privilege relating to the Acquiror Indemnified Person and may
participate in, but not to determine or conduct, any defense of the Third-
Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the Third-Party Claim.



(c) No settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with any third party claimant
shall be made without the prior written consent of the Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which
shall be deemed to have been given unless the Representative shall have
objected within 15 calendar days after a written request for such consent by
Acquiror. In the event that the Representative has consented to any
such settlement, neither the Representative nor any Effective Time Holder
shall have any power or authority to object under any provision hereof to the
amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Acquiror Indemnified Person against
the General Escrow Shares, General Escrow Cash, IP Escrow Shares, IP Escrow
Cash, earned but unpaid First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnouts,
previously paid First Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnouts, or
Effective Time Holders for indemnity with respect to such settlement.

pursuant to _Section 12.5_ shall contain the following information:



(a) that Acquiror or another Acquiror Indemnified Person has directly or
indirectly incurred, paid or properly accrued (in accordance with GAAP) or, in
good faith, believes it shall have to directly or indirectly incur, pay or
accrue (in accordance with GAAP), Damages in an aggregate stated amount
arising from such Claim (which amount may be the amount of damages claimed by
a third party in an action brought against any Acquiror Indemnified Person
based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for
Damages to such Acquiror Indemnified Person under this _Article 12_ ); and



(b) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Acquiror), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to
the alleged Damages based on Acquirors good faith belief thereof, including
the identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent reasonably
available to Acquiror) and copies of any formal demand or complaint,
the amount of Damages, the date each such item was incurred, paid or properly
accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the specific nature
of the breach to which such item is related.



12.8 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given by Acquiror
shall be resolved as follows:



(a)  _Uncontested Claims_. If, within 15 business days after a Notice of
Claim is received by the Representative, the Representative does not contest
such Notice of Claim in writing to Acquiror as provided in _Section 12.8(b)_ ,
the Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf
of all Effective Time Holders, to the recovery by the Acquiror Indemnified
Person of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim in
accordance with this  _Article 12_ , including the forfeiture of General
Escrow Shares, General Escrow Cash, IP Escrow Shares, IP Escrow Cash, First
Booking Earnout or Subsequent Booking Earnouts, as applicable, and, without
further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment for
damages against the Effective Time Holders for such amount in any court having
jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.



(b) _Contested Claims_. If the Representative gives Acquiror written notice
contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a "Contested Claim")
within the 15 business day period specified in _Section 12.8(a)_ , then such
Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement
executed by Acquiror and the Representative or (ii) in the absence of such a
written settlement agreement within 30 business days following receipt by
Acquiror of the written notice from the Representative, by binding litigation
between Acquiror and the Representative in accordance with the terms and
provisions of _Section 12.8(c)_.



(c) _Litigation of Contested Claims_. Either Acquiror or the Representative
may bring suit in the courts of the State of California and the Federal courts
of the United States of America located within the County of Santa Clara in
the State of California to resolve the Contested Claim. The case will be tried
to the court sitting without a jury. Regardless of which party brings suit to
resolve a matter, Acquiror shall bear the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence that Acquiror or other Acquiror Indemnified Persons are
entitled to  



 

88  indemnification pursuant to this _Article 12_. The decision of the trial
court as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Notice of Claim
shall be nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement and Acquiror shall be entitled to act in accordance with such
decision and make or withhold payments of General Escrow Shares, General
Escrow Cash, IP Escrow Shares, IP Escrow Cash, First Booking Earnout or
Subsequent Booking Earnouts in accordance therewith and herewith. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. For purposes of this _Section 12.8(c)_ , in any suit hereunder
in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Notice of Claim is at
issue, Acquiror shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless the
trial court awards Acquiror more than one-half of the amount in
dispute; otherwise, the Representative and Effective Time Holders shall be
deemed to be the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to a suit
shall pay its own expenses and the expenses, including attorneys fees and
costs, reasonably incurred by the other party to the suit.



12.9 _Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments_. All payments (if any)
made to an Acquiror Indemnified Person pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this _Article 12_ will be treated as adjustments to the
purchase price for tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for
purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.



ARTICLE 13

MISCELLANEOUS



13.1 _Governing Law_. The internal laws of the State of
California, irrespective of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern the
validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the
interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that issues involving the consummation and effects
of the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the State of California and the Federal courts of the United States
of America located within the County of Santa Clara in the State of California
solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including
resolution of disputes under _Section 12.8(c)_ ), and hereby waive, and agree
not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for
the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a
California State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant
any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the
manner provided in _Section_ _13.9_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie
solely in Santa Clara County, California.



 

89 13.2 _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns_.



(a) _Generally_. Except as set forth in the following  _Section 13.2(b)_ , no
party hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of
this provision shall be void.



(b) _Assignment by Acquiror_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the
successors and assigns of Acquiror. In the event of (i) the consummation of
any tender offer or exchange offer resulting in any person or "group" (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) beneficially owning more than 50% of the voting interest in the
total outstanding voting securities of Acquiror, (ii) any merger,
consolidation, or business combination involving Acquiror pursuant to which
the stockholders of Acquiror immediately preceding such transaction hold less
than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction or the parent entity of the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction, (iii) any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
Acquiror, or (iv) any sale by Acquiror of all or substantially all of the
Company Business or assets of the Company Business, then (x) the successor,
assignee or controlling person shall agree in writing to be bound by
Acquirors obligations hereunder, (y) _Section 3.3(b)_ (Milestone Limitation)
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, and (z) the Non-
Competition Agreements shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if
the successor or assignee cancels the Company Products and Product Roadmap or
ceases to actively market and sell Company Products.



13.3 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to
effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.



13.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party
whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or
more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.



13.5 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any State having jurisdiction.



 

90 13.6 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The
waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof
shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto as provided in this _Section 13.6_ at any time before or after
adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Applicable Law requires the
further approval of the Company Stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and
Acquiror, by action taken by its Board of Directors, may, to the extent
legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to it contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions for its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or extension
shall be effective unless signed in writing by the party against whom such
waiver or extension is asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of
the provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of
such party thereafter to enforce such provisions.



13.7 _Expenses_. Each party shall bear its respective legal, auditors,
investment bankers and financial advisors fees and other expenses incurred
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. If the First Merger is consummated, Acquiror will pay the reasonable
Merger Expenses incurred by Company, up to $300,000, at Closing (subject to
the prior receipt of itemized bills for services rendered, including time
entries and billing rates for counsel to the Company).



13.8 _Attorneys  Fees_. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any
part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as
an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys fees
to be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal).
The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit,
regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.



 

91 13.9 _Notices_. All notices and other communications required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered
in person, sent by facsimile, sent by certified or registered first-class
mail, postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier
service. Such notices and other communications shall be effective upon
receipt if hand delivered or sent by facsimile, three days after mailing if
sent by mail, and one day after dispatch if sent by express courier, to the
following addresses, or such other addresses as any party may notify
the other parties in accordance with this _Section 13.9_ :

or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of the
parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an

the Company shall issue a press release approved by both parties announcing
the Merger. Thereafter, Acquiror may issue such press releases, and make such
other disclosures regarding the Merger, as it determines are required under
applicable securities laws or regulatory rules. Prior to the publication of
such initial and mutually agreed press release, neither party shall make any
general public announcement relating to this Agreement or the transactions
