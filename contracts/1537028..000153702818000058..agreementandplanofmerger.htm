(a)   As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has received the executed New   Term Loan Commitment Letter from the financial institutions party thereto, pursuant to which   such financial institutions have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein,   to provide to Parent the Financing. A true and complete copy of the New Term Loan   Commitment Letter, which has been redacted in the manner required by the terms thereof to   remove the amounts, percentages and basis points of compensation set forth therein, has been   made available to the Company.                (b)   Parent has fully paid, or caused to be paid, any and all commitment fees or   other fees required by such New Term Loan Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date   of this Agreement.  The New Term Loan Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding   obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party   thereto, in each case, in accordance with its terms except as may be limited by the Enforceability   Exceptions. As of the date of this Agreement, each New Term Loan Commitment Letter is in full   force and effect, has not been amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any   respect, and no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would   reasonably be expected to constitute a breach thereunder on the part of Parent. No amendment or   modification to, or withdrawal, termination or rescission of, any New Term Loan Commitment   Letter is contemplated other than amendment or modifications permitted by Section 7.21.    Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement (including   Section 8.1(d)), the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the New Term Loan Commitment   Letter, together with available cash of Parent, will be sufficient for Parent to complete the   transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to satisfy all of the obligations of Parent and   Merger Sub under this Agreement, including to pay the Closing payments as set forth in Section   4.1. Parent has not incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or liability of any kind, and   is not contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction or liability of any kind,   in either case which would reasonably be expected to impair or adversely affect such resources.   As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other Contracts, arrangements or   understandings related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of obligations under this   Agreement that could reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or substantially delay the availability   of the full amount such funds contemplated by the New Term Loan Commitment Letter at the   Closing or (ii) affect the enforceability of the New Term Loan Commitment Letter.
