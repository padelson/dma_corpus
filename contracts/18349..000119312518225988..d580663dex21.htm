and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a direct, wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as
the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Company shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under
the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will occur by electronic exchange
of documents at 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on a date which shall be no
later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in
_Article_ __ _ VII_ hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature
can be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement
of the parties hereto (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 1.3 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in
the certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the " _Delaware Secretary_ ") on the Closing Date. The term " _Effective
Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set
forth in the Certificate of Merger.

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.5 _Conversion of Company Class_ __ _ A Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
the Company, Merger Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, each share of Class A common stock,
par value $0.001 per share (the " _Company Class_ __ _ A Common Stock_"), of
the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except for shares of Company Class A Common Stock owned by the Company as
treasury stock or owned by the Company or Parent (in each case other than in a
fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted),
shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, 1.055 shares
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and such shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ ") of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common
Stock_ ").

 



- 2 \- (b) All of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock converted into the
right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ I_ shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "
_Certificate_ ," it being understood that any reference herein to "
_Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Class A Common
Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Class A Common Stock
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a certificate

for exchange in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_, certificates or, at
Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form (collectively,
referred to herein as " _certificates_ "), representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued to holders of Company Class A Common Stock, and cash
in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent

issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and paid

Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one
or more Certificates representing shares of Company Class A Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Article_ __ _ I_, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in

Company Class A Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Company Class A Common
Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article_ __ _
I_ and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ II_, and (B) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, and
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares

the right to receive, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect
of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this _Article_ __ _ II_. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance
with this _Article_ __ _ II_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole
shares of Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Class A Common Stock

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange

 



- 8 \-  shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares
of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares as provided in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average
of the closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading
days ending on the trading day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Parent
Common Stock Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock

__ _ 1.5_.

stockholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to Parent. Any former stockholder of the Company that has not
theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Class A
Common Stock such former stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

 

(g) Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made.

 



- 9 \- (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of
Parent Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends
or distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of _Article_ __ _
III_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of _Article_ __ _ III_

Company after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding
risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or
disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer
or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and is a bank holding company duly registered with the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the " _Federal Reserve Board_ ")
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ ").
The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted in all material respects. The Company is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i)
the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations
or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect

hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting

Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public
disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
any effect on a partys relationships with its customers or employees) or
actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (E) a decline in the trading price of a
partys common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet
earnings projections or internal financial forecasts (it being understood
that the underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account
in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred); except, with
respect to subclauses (A), (B) and (C), to the extent that the effects of
such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business,
properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition
of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other
companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or
(ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ "

the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this

organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is

properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, except
with respect to each of clause (ii) and (iii) as has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. There are no restrictions on
the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or
distributions except, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity,
for restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of each Subsidiary of the
Company that is an insured depository institution are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit Insurance
Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments
required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due, and no
proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or threatened.

omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or

deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. Since January 1, 2015, as
of their respective dates, all Company Reports filed under the Securities Act

Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders

indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all

LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company that it intends to resign) or

or in connection with any disagreements with the Company on a matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure.

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by
GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, except
for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (including any notes
thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since December 31, 2017, or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known
to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board
of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

summarize and report financial information, and (B) to the knowledge of the
Company, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to
believe that the Companys outside auditors and its chief executive officer
and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-

respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no

Plan or the related trust.

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. During the immediately preceding six
(6) years, no Controlled Group Liability has been incurred by the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk to
the Company or its ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability, except
as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected

to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

(f) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any plan that is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors,
at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of
Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ ").

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors any employee
benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health
or medical or life insurance benefits for retired or former employees or their
beneficiaries or dependents, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 

(h) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document, and all premiums due or payable with
respect to insurance policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period
through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have
been fully reflected on the books and records of the Company, except as,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted or instituted, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim
or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of
the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans, except as, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result in, cause the vesting,
exercisability or delivery of, cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
transfer or set aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iii) result in any limitation on the right of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion
of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. No amount paid or
payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a

 



- 20 \-  result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code (or any
corresponding provisions of state or local law relating to Tax).

material labor grievances or material unfair labor practice claims or charges
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any strikes or other
material labor disputes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any

all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments

pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state,
any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and

such Parent Report as of the date thereof (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information

31, 2015, as of their respective dates, all Parent Reports filed under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or

Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders equity and

indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of
Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all
material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. KPMG LLP has not
resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by GAAP to
be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent, except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Parent included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2017 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities

of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parents
outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents Board of Directors (A)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (B) to the knowledge of Parent, any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge
of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents outside auditors and
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.

practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of

Agencies and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the

information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party
may reasonably request. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their

information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of Parents or the Companys, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control
of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any
common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty

the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Parent Vote required
in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and
mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before an
annual or special meeting of shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) to
adopt a merger agreement or approve the issuance of Shares contemplated
thereby (as applicable). The Board of Directors of each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders
of Parent and the stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, the
Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, and the Requisite Company Vote,
in the case of the Company, including by communicating to its respective
shareholders or stockholders (as applicable) its recommendation
(and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they
approve the Parent Stock Issuance or adopt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (as applicable). However, subject to _Sections 8.1_ and
_8.2_ , if the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent, after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and, with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be more likely than
not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to
continue to recommend this Agreement or the Parent Stock Issuance (as
applicable), then in submitting this Agreement or the Parent Stock Issuance
(as applicable), such Board of Directors may (but shall not be required to)
submit this Agreement or the Parent Stock Issuance (as applicable) to its
stockholders or shareholders (as applicable) without recommendation (although
the resolutions approving this Agreement or the Parent Stock Issuance
(as applicable) as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its stockholders or shareholders (as applicable) in the
Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to
the extent required by law; _provided_ that neither Board of Directors may
take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the other party at
least three (3) business days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving
rise to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such
action is taken by the Board of Directors of the Company in

 



- 49 \-  response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe
in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of
such notice period, the applicable Board of Directors takes into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and
after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and, with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it
would nevertheless be more likely than not to result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this
Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed
to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and
will require a new notice period as referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.
Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the
Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting
is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
or the Company Class A Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company or
Parent, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the
Requisite Parent Vote, and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall continue to use
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from its stockholders or
shareholders (as applicable) in order to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or
Requisite Parent Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, each
of the Parent Meeting and Company Meeting shall be convened and the Parent
Stock Issuance shall be submitted to the shareholders of Parent and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Parent
Meeting and the Company Meeting, respectively, for the purpose of voting on
the approval or adoption (as applicable) of such proposals and the other
matters contemplated hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve either Parent or the Company of such obligation. Parent and the
Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate to hold the
Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting on the same day and at the same time
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, and to set
the same record date for each such meeting.

 

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to  _Section_
__ _ 6.1_ of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on
such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger
and, subject to the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_,
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to
obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental
Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the New
York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

 



- 50 \- 6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_. (a) During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
immediately following the Effective Time for so long as such employee is
employed following the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary or base wage rate, as
applicable, that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage rate,
as applicable, provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) annual or
short-term cash incentive compensation target opportunities that, in each
case, are no less favorable than the annual or short- term cash incentive
compensation target opportunities provided by Parent to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) other compensation and
employee benefits that are no less favorable than the other compensation and
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that Parent may satisfy its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)(iii)_ for a transitional period by providing such
compensation and employee benefits on terms that are substantially similar in
the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing Employee whose
employment terminates during the 12-month period following the Closing Date
with severance benefits as set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and
their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous the Company Benefit Plan, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with credit for
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the
Effective Time under a Company Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-
pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any
New Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for
benefit accrual purposes under any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of
its affiliates that is a defined benefit pension or post-retirement welfare
plan, or (C) where such service is with respect to a benefit plan of Parent
newly-established after the Effective Time and for which similarly-
situated employees of Parent do not receive past service credit.

(c) If requested by Parent in writing no later than ten (10) days prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary
to cause the Companys 401(k) Plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be
terminated (and all account balances thereunder to be 

 



- 51 \-  fully vested) effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time and applicable law. To the
extent that the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to the previous
sentence, each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time who is a Continuing Employee shall be immediately
eligible as of the Effective Time to commence participation in a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan of Parent or one of its Affiliates (the " _Parent
401(k) Plan_ ") and be given the opportunity to elect to "roll over" the
account balance (including any outstanding loans) under the Company 401(k)
Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan. All resolutions to be adopted and notices or
other documents to be issued to the Company 401(k) Plan participants in
connection with the implementation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_ shall be
subject to Parents reasonable prior review and approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and in any event shall be
delivered to Parent not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the
Effective Time.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with
or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the
services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter
or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit
Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person, including, without limitation,
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Insurance_. (a)
From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or
after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person
and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law; _provided_ that the
Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses

 



- 52 \-  are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably
cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party, and the Company Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and the Surviving Corporation, in
the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company ( _provided_ that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ that Parent shall not be obligated
to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current
annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any
time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in Parents good faith determination,
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the
Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent may (and with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company may use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain
at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed
the Premium Cap. If Parent or the Company purchases such a "tail policy,"
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail policy" in full
force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Company
under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall not be terminated or modified after
the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_ without the prior written consent of the affected Company
Indemnified Party or affected person.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns will consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or substantially all of
its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar
transaction, then in each case to the extent the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ are not otherwise transferred and assumed by such
successors and assigns by operation of law or otherwise, the Surviving
Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _  6.7_.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and 

 



- 53 \-  franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries
shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by
Parent.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company (in such capacity, the "
_Notifying Party_ ") shall each promptly advise the other party of any change
or event (i) that has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Notifying Party or (ii) which the Notifying Party believes
would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach
of any of the Notifying Partys representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, either
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition set forth in,
if Parent is the Notifying Party, _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _7.3_ , or if the
Company is the Notifying Party,  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ or _7.2_ ; _provided_
that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect
to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company agrees that it will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate
in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have
or participate in any discussions with, any person relating to any Acquisition
Proposal, except to notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of the
Company, is making any inquiries with respect to, or is considering making,
an Acquisition Proposal of the existence of the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.10(a)_; _provided_ that, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company by the Requisite Company Vote, in the event
the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement and its Board of Directors concludes in good
faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is more likely than not to result in a Superior Proposal, it
may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the
extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving
the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its
financial advisor) that failure to take such actions would be more likely than
not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall
have provided such information to Parent and entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company. The Company will, and will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Parent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



- 54 \-  The Company will promptly (within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance
thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of
the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent
reasonably apprised (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry
or Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall (A) withdraw and terminate access
that was granted to any person (other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective affiliates and Representatives) to any "data room" (virtual
or physical) that was established in connection with a transaction involving
the Company and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing
confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. During the
term of this Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to on its behalf, enter
into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive
transaction agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).
As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or
inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, (i) any
acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-
tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in
such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or
voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to, within ten (10)
business days after the date hereof, request and confirm the return or
destruction of any confidential information provided to any person (other than
Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to any such confidentiality, standstill or
similar agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ "
shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith to be more favorable to its
stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a
nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account
the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth
therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of
outside counsel) financial (including the financing terms of any such
proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal (including any
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any other
relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ , that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the reference to "25%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority."

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or
its Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or from making any legally required

 



- 55 \-  disclosure to the Companys stockholders; _provided_ that such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.11 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall each use their
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan to ensure that
all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law, or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 6.12 _Change of Method_. Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to
the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the
combination of the Company and Parent (including the provisions of  _Article_
__ _ I_), if and to the extent they both deem such change to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable; _provided_ that no such change shall (a) alter or
change the Exchange Ratio or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
received by the Companys stockholders in exchange for each share of Company
Class A Common Stock, (b) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Companys
stockholders or Parents shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, (c)
adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Company or Parent pursuant to this
Agreement or (d) materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner. The
parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.2_.

 

6.13 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either the Company or Parent shall have
failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote at
the duly convened Company Meeting or Parent Meeting, as applicable, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the parties shall in good faith
use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that neither
party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms,
including the Exchange Ratio, the amount or kind of the consideration to be
issued to holders of the capital stock of the Company as provided for in this
Agreement, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or
stockholders (as applicable)) and/or resubmit this Agreement and/or
the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_) to its respective shareholders or stockholders (as
applicable) for approval or adoption (as applicable).

 

6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective
Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover
Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated

 



- 56 \-  hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability
of any such Takeover Statute.

6.15 _Exemption from Liability under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. The Company
and Parent agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
those officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_
"), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company
Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of Company Class A Common Stock and Company
Equity Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose
agree to the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.15_. The Board of
Directors of Parent and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall prior to the Effective Time take all such steps as
may be required to cause (in the case of the Company) any dispositions of
Company Class A Common Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company
Insiders, and (in the case of Parent) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be
officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

6.16 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any action, arbitration, audit,
hearing, investigation, litigation, suit, subpoena or summons issued,
commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or before, or otherwise involving,
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of Parent
or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby or thereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent,
the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto,
or (b) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors or affiliates relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld). 

6.17 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Parent agrees to execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to the
Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of the Companys obligations in
respect of its outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements
to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and
other agreements.

 

6.18 _Data Conversion_. From and after the date hereof, the parties shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of
the Company with the business of Parent following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet on a

 



- 57 \-  regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the data processing
and related electronic information technology system (the " _Data Conversion_
") to those used by Parent. The parties agree to use all commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly commence preparations for implementation of the
Data Conversion, with the goal of effecting the Data Conversion after the
Effective Time and at such later time as mutually agreed upon by the parties.
The parties agree to cooperate in preparing for the Data Conversion, including
by providing reasonable access to data, information systems, and personnel
having expertise with their and their respective Subsidiaries information
and data systems; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither party shall be
required to terminate any third-party service provider arrangements prior to
the Effective Time. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company on request
for reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses or charges that the Company may
incur as a result of taking, at the request of Parent, any action prior to the
Effective Time to facilitate the Data Conversion.

true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except
to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier
date) as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date,

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Parent Stock
Issuance or adoption of this Agreement (as applicable) by the shareholders of
Parent or the stockholders of the Company (as applicable):

 

(a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if
the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the
members of its entire Board;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or the
Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure
to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before July 23, 2019 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; _provided_ that if
on the Termination Date, the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_
shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions to Closing shall have
been satisfied or capable of being satisfied, then the Termination Date may
be extended for a period of three months at the option of either the Company
or Parent by written notice to the other on or prior to the Termination Date;

 

(d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of
the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or
any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, in the case of
a termination by Parent, or _7.3_ , in the case of a termination by the
Company, and which is not cured within forty-five (45) days following written
notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or 

 



- 61 \-  Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or
timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior
to the Termination Date);

 

(e) by the Company prior to such time as the Requisite Parent Vote is
obtained, if (i) the Board of Directors of Parent shall have failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the shareholders of Parent approve
the Parent Stock Issuance, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such
recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company, or publicly disclosed that
it has resolved to do so, or (ii) Parent or its Board of Directors has
breached its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ in any material respect;
or

 

(f) by Parent prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained,
if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (A) failed to
recommend in the Joint Proxy Statement that the stockholders of the Company
adopt this Agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly disclosed that it has resolved to
do so, or failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange
offer constituting an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly disclosed
within ten (10) business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, in any such case whether or not permitted by the terms hereof
or (B) recommended or endorsed an Acquisition Proposal or failed to issue a
press release announcing its opposition to such Acquisition Proposal within
ten (10) business days after an Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, or
(ii) the Company or its Board of Directors has breached its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or _6.10_ in any material respect.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. (a) In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of
Parent, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature
whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that

 

(i) _Sections 6.2(b)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and  _Article_ __ _
IX_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and

 

(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its Willful Breach of any provision of
this Agreement occurring prior to termination (which, in the case of the
Company, shall include the loss to the holders of Company Class A Common
Stock and Company Equity Awards of the economic benefits of the Merger,
including the loss of the premium offered to the holders of Company Class A
Common Stock and Company Equity Awards, it being understood that the Company
shall be entitled to pursue damages for such losses and to enforce the right
to recover such losses on behalf of its shareholders and the holders of
Company Equity Awards in its sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts
received by the Company in connection therewith may be retained by the
Company). " _Willful Breach_ " shall mean a material breach of, or material
failure to perform any of the covenants or other agreements contained in, this
Agreement, that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching
or non-performing party with actual knowledge that such partys

 



- 62 \-  act or failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in
or constitute a breach of or failure of performance under this Agreement.

 

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to senior management or the board of directors of the
Company or has been made directly to its stockholders generally or any person
shall have publicly announced (whether or not withdrawn) an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company and (A) thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_
without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained or (B) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ and
(C) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a
transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same
Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company shall, on
the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date
of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day
funds, a fee equal to $93,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ that
for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%".

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer
of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, then Parent shall pay the Company, by wire
transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting
the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages arising out of the
other partys fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of this Agreement, in
the event that this Agreement is terminated as provided in _Section_ __ _
8.1_ under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable and paid in
full, the maximum aggregate amount of monetary fees, liabilities or damages
payable by a single party under this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be equal to
the Termination Fee, and neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(e) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if Parent or the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying party for
the Termination Fee, such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of
the other party (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. In addition, if Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.2_, then such party shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the
period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in

 



- 63 \-  full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by
JPMorgan Chase and Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which
such payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts
payable by Parent and the Company, as applicable, pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)_ constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the
case of fraud or Willful Breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary
remedy of the Company and Parent, as applicable, in the event of a termination
of this Agreement specified in such section under circumstances where the
Termination Fee is payable and is paid in full.

irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached.
Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the
Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)

obtaining equitable relief.

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such
that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall
be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or
email delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this
Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement
or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or email delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
