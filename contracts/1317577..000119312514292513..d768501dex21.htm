ARTICLE II __

 

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the Excluded Shares, the
Company Restricted Shares and the Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive $12.00 in cash without interest (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1(a)
shall be automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or Shares in book-entry form)
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes)
subject to compliance with Section 2.2.

(b)  _Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (i) any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent or (iii) Merger Sub, including the Rollover Shares
(such Shares in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by holders of such Shares who have (i)
not voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement or consented thereto in
writing and (ii) properly exercised (and not lost or properly withdrawn)
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and otherwise
complied with, Section 55-13-21 of the NCBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "),
shall not be

  



3  converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a). Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to receive
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of such Section 55-13-21, unless and until any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment
under the NCBCA. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such rights, such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon cease to be Dissenting Shares, including for purposes of
Section 2.1(a), and shall be deemed to have been converted into, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender,
in the manner provided for in Section 2.1(a), of the Certificate or
Certificates (or effective affidavits in lieu of loss thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares that formerly evidenced such Shares, and the Surviving Corporation
shall become liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares.
At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist and any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section
55-13-21 of the NCBCA and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company
shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any demands received prior to the
Effective Time by the Company for appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of any
demands received and any other communications received by the Company in
respect of the demand, withdrawal or perfection of the appraisal rights and
(y) the opportunity to conduct jointly all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such notices and demands. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle any such demands or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed by Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as
a paying agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration, if any, in exchange for all of the Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded
Shares, the Company Restricted Shares and the Dissenting Shares), payable (i)
upon due surrender of the certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or (ii) automatically in the case of non-
certificated Shares represented by book-entry that are not Dissenting Shares
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (such
cash in the aggregate being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). In the event any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent in the Exchange
Fund, an amount equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration and (y)
the number of such formerly Dissenting Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement,
Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to,
promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount
sufficient to make such payments. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and (2) no such 

 



4  investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the former
holders of Shares pursuant to this Article II.

 

(b) Payment Procedures.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1 (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily and
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor a check in
an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares represented by
such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (B) the Merger Consideration
(less any applicable withholding Taxes). No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to
such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer and other applicable Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The
Merger Consideration, paid in full (less any applicable withholding Taxes)
with respect to any Share in accordance with the terms hereof, shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Share. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares.

(iii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "),
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be (A) remitted by the applicable entity to the appropriate
Governmental Entity and (B) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

 

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further

Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
Option Consideration, RSU Award Consideration or Restricted Shares
Consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so

to such representation and warranty is reasonably apparent from the text of
the disclosure made and, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter as an

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it

Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer by
others in the Company or its Subsidiaries to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Except as would not

Effect, the Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior
to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the
Company Board, (a) any material weaknesses in its internal controls over
financial

 



12  reporting and (b) any allegation of fraud that involves management of the
Company or any other employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting

of the Company, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has received any
written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or

consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, other than those which would not reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since March 31, 2014,

Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets and to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted, except where the

time, or both) has occurred under any such Company Permit, and none of the
Company or its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw or modify any

impair, prevent or materially delay the ability of each of Parent and Merger
Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Parent has made available

Agreement.

 

(b) Assuming receipt of the Parent Approvals, the execution, delivery and

acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any loan,
guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,

would, individually or in the aggregate, impair, prevent or materially delay
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, and there are no actions, suits, inquiries, investigations or
proceedings pending (or, to Parents Knowledge, threatened) against or
affecting Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties
at law or in equity before, and there are no orders, judgments or decrees of,
or before, any Governmental Entity, in each case which would, individually or
in the aggregate, impair, prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

supplied in writing by Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to be included
in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 will, assuming the Companys
compliance with its obligations under Section 5.4, at the time the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 is filed with the SEC, or at the time
the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company or at
the time of the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No representation is
made by Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to any other
statements made in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3.

Section 4.6 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has received and accepted an executed commitment letter dated as of
the date hereof (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from the lenders party
thereto (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which the Lenders have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend amounts set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "). The Debt Financing
Commitments pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter are collectively referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Debt Financing_."

 

(b) Parent has received and accepted (i) the Equity Commitment Letter from the
Equity Investor pursuant to which the Equity Investor has agreed, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent the amounts set forth
therein (the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ ") and (ii) an executed Rollover
Contribution Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the " _Rollover
Contribution Agreement_ " and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") from the Rollover
Investors pursuant to which the Rollover Investors have committed, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, to transfer, contribute and deliver to
Parent the Rollover Shares (the " _Rollover Investment_ " and, together with
the Debt Financing Commitments and the Equity Financing Commitment, the "
_Financing Commitments_ "). The equity committed pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Equity Financing_." The Equity Financing, the Debt Financing and the
Rollover Investment are collectively referred to as the " _Financing_." Parent
has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the executed
Commitment Letters and the fee letter referenced in the Debt Commitment
Letter (the " _Fee Letter_ ") (except that the fee amounts and other economic
provisions (none of which would adversely affect the amount or availability of
the Debt Financing) set forth therein have been redacted). There are no
agreements, side letters or arrangements, other than the Commitment Letters
and the Fee Letter, to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
is a party relating to any of the Financing Commitments that would adversely
affect the availability of the Financing.

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters and the Fee
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders,
the Equity Investor or the

 



25  Rollover Investors to provide the Financing or any contingencies that would
permit the Lenders, the Equity Investor or the Rollover Investors to reduce
the total amount of the Financing. Assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.3 and the completion of the
Marketing Period, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that
the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the Closing
Date.

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a)
and Section 6.3(b), the Financing, when funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, will provide Parent with cash proceeds on the Closing Date
(after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and
similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the maximum amount of
flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter) sufficient for the satisfaction
of Parents and Merger Subs obligations to pay (i) the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration, the RSU Award Consideration and the
Restricted Shares Consideration, (ii) any fees and expenses of or payable
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation and (iii) all other
amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub hereunder or incurred by
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(e) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are (i) valid and binding
obligations of Parent and any Parent Affiliates party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, of each of the other parties thereto (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
and (ii) in full force and effect. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
Parent, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both, would reasonably be expected to result in a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms
and conditions of the Commitment Letters. Parent has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of
the Commitment Letters on or before the date of this Agreement, and will pay
in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. None of the
Commitment Letters has been modified, amended or altered as of the date
hereof, none of the Commitment Letters will be amended, modified or altered at
any time through the Closing, except as permitted by Section 5.12(b), and as
of the date hereof, none of the respective commitments under any of the
Commitment Letters have been reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.

(f) Without limiting Section 8.5(b), in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing) by or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing
transaction be a condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations
hereunder.

(g) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates, is
a party to any contracts, or has made or entered into any formal or informal
arrangement or other understanding (whether or not binding), with any other
Person that prohibits such Person from providing any other Person with
financing or other potential sources of capital (whether equity, debt,
rollover or a hybrid thereof) in connection with the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.7 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly by
Parent.

 



26  Merger Sub has outstanding no option, warrant, right, or any other agreement
pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may, directly or indirectly,
acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has been formed solely
for the purpose of the Merger Agreement and has not conducted any business
prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time will have,
no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident
to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Financing and the Merger

commitments, agreements, obligations, arrangements or understandings, whether
written or oral, between Parent, Merger Sub, the Equity Investor or any
of their respective Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Rollover
Investors or any of their respective Affiliates on the one hand, and any
beneficial owner of outstanding Shares or any member of the Companys
management or the Company Board, on the other hand, relating in any way to
(i) the Shares, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or employment
or (ii) the ownership or operations of the Company after the Effective Time
that would require disclosure in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3.

Section 4.9 _Ownership of Common Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates beneficially owns (as such term
is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly
(including pursuant to a derivatives contract), any shares of Common Stock or
other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for shares
of Common Stock or any securities of any Subsidiary of the Company and none of
Parent, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates has any rights to acquire, directly or
indirectly, any shares of Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement or
agreements to which the Company is a party.

Section 4.10 _Solvency_. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger and the Financing) and assuming (a) the accuracy in all
material respects of the representations and warranties contained in Article
III (without giving effect to any materiality, "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or Knowledge qualification), (b) the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.1 and 6.3 and (c) that all estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans of the Company provided to Parent were prepared in
good faith by the Company using all material information reasonably available
to the Company for such purpose at the time of such preparation and based
upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable:

(x) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
assets of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
will be greater than the total amount of their liabilities, taken as a whole,
(including all liabilities, whether or not reflected in a balance sheet
prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether direct or indirect, fixed or
contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed);

 

(y) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay their
debts and obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become due;
and

(z) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the businesses in which they are
engaged.

Section 4.11 _Finders or Brokers_. None of Parent, the Equity Investor, the
Rollover Investors or any of their respective Subsidiaries has employed any
investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any 

 



27  commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be responsible to pay in the event
the Merger is not consummated.

 

Section 4.12 _No Competing Businesses_. None of Parents Affiliates (including
the Equity Investor and its Affiliates) or other Entity within the same
Person as Parent are engaged in, and none of Parent nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Equity Investor and its Affiliates) or other Entity within the
same Person as Parent beneficially owns any equity interests or
voting securities (including any equity interests or voting securities that
may be acquired through the conversion or exchange of securities or the
exercise of options, warrants or other rights) in excess of 4.9% of the
outstanding capital stock of any Person engaged in any business that derives
a substantial portion of its revenue from a line of business within the
Company principal lines of business. As used in this Section 4.12, the terms "
_Entity_ " and " _Person_ " have the respective meanings given to such terms
in the rules promulgated under the HSR Act.

 

Section 4.13 _Investigation; No Other Representations and Warranties_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its own independent review and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent and Merger Sub has been
provided access for such purposes. In entering into this Agreement, each of

representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or orally. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their
respective Affiliates, shareholders, controlling persons or Representatives,
shall have no liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Affiliates, shareholders, controlling persons or
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information (including any
statement, document or agreement delivered in connection with this Agreement
and any financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-
looking information) provided or made available (including in any data room,
management presentation, information or descriptive memorandum or
supplemental information), or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to
Parent, Merger Sub, or their respective Affiliates, shareholders, controlling
persons or Representatives, except (i) with respect to the Company, for the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in Article
III (subject to the qualifications set forth therein) and any certificates
delivered by or on behalf of the Company at the Closing in connection
with the Merger and any disclosures related thereto set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Documents and (ii) with respect to the
Companys shareholders, any letter of transmittal delivered in connection with
the Merger and any agreements listed on Section 4.13(a) of the Parent

Agreement, (ii) no Person has been authorized by the Company to make any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in

financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or
information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
representatives by or on behalf of the Company, oral or written, are not and

of the Equity Investor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general

respect. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or

Section 5.2 _Access; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, the Company shall afford to
Parent, Merger Sub and the Lenders and to its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial
advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Parent
Representatives_ "), upon written request, reasonable access during normal
business hours, during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
and the Termination Date, to the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers,
employees, properties, assets, liabilities, contracts, commitments, books and
records, including for the purpose of conducting any non-invasive "Phase I"
type environment assessment or audit (which shall not include the taking of
soil, groundwater, surface water, air or building material samples or
other invasive testing), other than, subject to Section 5.3, any such matters
that relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, or to
transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or proposals from other parties relating to
any competing or alternative transactions. The foregoing notwithstanding, the
Company shall not be required to afford such access if and to the extent it
would (i) unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) violate any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
obligations with respect to confidentiality, so long as the Company shall have
used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
party to afford such access, (iii) on the advice of counsel, be reasonably
likely to result in the loss of privilege or trade secret protection to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) reasonably be expected to result
in a violation of any applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each
case, the Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effects
of such restriction or to provide a reasonable alternative to such access. In
the event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance
on the preceding sentence, the Company shall provide notice to Parent that
such access or information is being withheld and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible,
the applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable
obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to it, Merger Sub, any
Lender or any Parent Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein shall be deemed to be
Confidential Information, as such term is used in, and shall be treated in
accordance with the confidentiality agreement, dated as of April 4, 2014,
between the Company and Court Square Capital Partners (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 

Section 5.3 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on September 4, 2014 (the " _No-Shop Period
Start Date_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, Affiliates, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") shall have the right to (i) initiate, solicit and
encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide access to non-public information to any
Person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement entered into by

 



33  such Person containing terms that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
the Company or more favorable to such Person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (any such confidentiality agreement, an "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall
promptly make available (and in any event within 48 hours) to Parent and
Merger Sub any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries or access that is provided to any Person given such access that
was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub and (iii) subject to
the preceding clause (ii), engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal and cooperate with or assist or participate in or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations or any
effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall take any actions that would have the
effect of limiting in any way Parents rights under Sections 5.3(e) and
5.3(f). No later than two (2) Business Days after the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each
Person or group of Persons from whom the Company received an Acquisition
Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the No-Shop
Period Start Date, and provide to Parent (x) a copy of any Acquisition
Proposal made in writing and any other written terms or proposals provided
(including financing commitments) to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and (y) a written summary of the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal
not made in writing (including any terms proposed orally or supplementally).

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, immediately following
the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective Representatives to, cease and cause
to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation
with any Persons with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and use reasonable
best efforts to require the immediate return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished.

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, from the No-Shop Period
Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to direct and
cause its Representatives not to, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly
encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations with any Person with respect to, or provide any non-public
information or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person
relating to, an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition
Proposal or (iii) enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
similar definitive agreement, or any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or agreement in principle, or any other agreement (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) relating to an Acquisition Proposal
or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, breach or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at any time
following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the time the Shareholder
Approval is obtained, if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal from any
Person that did not result from a breach of Sections 5.3(b) or (c), the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide
information (including any non-public information) regarding, and afford
access to, the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of,
the Company and its

 



34  Subsidiaries to such Person if the Company receives from such Person (or has
received from such Person) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , that the Company shall promptly (and in any event with 24 hours)
make available to Parent and Merger Sub any non-public information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such
access that was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub and
(ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that
prior to taking any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company
Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, until 11:59
p.m. on September 17, 2014, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities described
in Section 5.3(a) (subject to the limitations and obligations set forth
therein) with, and the restrictions in Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(c) shall
not apply to, any Excluded Party, including with respect to any amended or
modified Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following the
No-Shop Period Start Date.

 

(e) Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 48 hours after receipt), notify Parent both orally and in
writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiries that would
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, or any request
for information from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or resumed
with, either the Company or its Representatives concerning an Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall include (i) a copy of any Acquisition Proposal
(including any financing commitments) made in writing and other written terms
or proposals provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) a
written summary of the material terms of any Acquisition Proposal not made in
writing or any such inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48 hours) of
any material developments, material discussions or material negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, inquiry that would reasonably be expected
to result in an Acquisition Proposal, or request for non-public information
and, upon the reasonable request of Parent, shall apprise Parent of the status
of any discussions or negotiations with respect to any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
agreement that would prohibit them from providing such information or the
information contemplated by the last sentence of Section 5.3(a) to Parent.

(f) Except as set forth in this Section 5.3(f), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) shall (i) change,
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (ii) fail to include the
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company, an
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) authorize, adopt, approve or propose to authorize,
adopt or approve, an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or
(v) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the
Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
Company shareholders (including, for these purposes, by disclosing that it
is taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such

 



35  tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders, which shall constitute a
failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
offer, _provided_ that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall not be
prohibited), within ten (10) Business Days after commencement (any of the
foregoing, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Shareholder
Approval is obtained (but not after), the Company Board may effect a Change of
Recommendation if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and upon recommendation thereof by the
Special Committee) constitutes a Superior Proposal and/or authorize, adopt,
approve, propose to authorize, adopt or approve, or cause or permit the
Company to enter into, the Alternative Acquisition Agreement associated with
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
only take the actions described in the foregoing clause if the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) concurrently with
entering into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pays the applicable
Company Termination Payment and Company Expense Payment in compliance with
Section 7.3 and if:

(w) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent of the
Company Boards intention to take such actions at least four (4) Business Days
in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify the material
terms of the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, including a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with, and the identity of, the party making the Acquisition
Proposal and other material documents (including any financing commitments
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal) and any arrangements with the
Rollover Investors or any of their Affiliates;

 

(x) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such
four (4) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Financing as would permit the Company
Board not to take such actions;

(y) the Special Committee and the Company Board shall have considered in good
faith any changes to this Agreement and the Financing or other arrangements
that may be offered in writing by Parent by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the fourth
(4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have
determined in good faith (1) after consultation with outside counsel, that it
would continue to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law not to effect the Change of Recommendation and (2) after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that the
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were given effect; and

(z) the Acquisition Proposal to which this provision applies is
thereafter modified in any material respect by the party making such
Acquisition Proposal, the Company provides written notice of such modified
Acquisition Proposal to Parent and shall again comply with clauses (w), (x)
and (y) above and provides Parent with an additional two (2) Business Days
notice prior to effecting any Change of Recommendation or effecting a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) (and shall do so for each
subsequent modification).

 



36 (g) Subject to the proviso in this Section 5.3(g), nothing contained in
this Section 5.3 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Company Board,
the Special Committee or any other committee of the Company Board from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the
making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer); _provided_ , that
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall effect a Change of
Recommendation unless the applicable requirements of Section 5.3(f) shall have
been satisfied. Actions permitted under this Section 5.3(g) shall not be a
basis for Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii).

 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide inquiry, proposal or offer made by any Person for (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
the Company (in each case where the owners of at least 20% of the voting
power of the Common Stock prior to such transaction cease to own at least 20%
of the voting power of common stock of the surviving entity in such
transaction), (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated
revenues or net income (including, in each case, securities of the Companys
Subsidiaries), or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock, including any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning Shares with twenty
percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock.

 

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person, group of
Persons or group of Persons that includes any Person or group of Persons,
from whom the Company or any of its Representatives has received prior to the
No-Shop Period Start Date a written Acquisition Proposal that the Special
Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisors, is or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal; provided that if the Company provides notice to Parent that
it is no longer engaged in negotiations with any Excluded Party then there
shall no longer be any Person or group of Persons considered to be an Excluded
Party.

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term
changed from 20% to 50%) that the Company Board has determined in its good
faith judgment (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) is more favorable to the Companys shareholders (other than
the Rollover Investors) than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account, among other things, all
of the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the
financing, likelihood and timing of consummation thereof) and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent
to the Company in writing in response to such Acquisition Proposal under the
provisions of Section 5.3(f) or otherwise).

 



37 Section 5.4 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, subject
to the receipt from Parent and Merger Sub of the information described in the
second sentence of this clause (a), the Company shall prepare the Proxy
Statement, which shall, subject to Section 5.3, include the Recommendation,
and the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, shall jointly prepare a Rule 13E-3 transaction statement on Schedule
13E-3 (the " _Schedule 13E-3_"). Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all
information concerning themselves and their Affiliates that is required to be
included in the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide such other
assistance in the preparation of the Proxy Statement as may be reasonably
requested by the Company from time to time. As promptly as practicable (and in
any event within the earlier of (i) twenty (20) calendar days after the No-
Shop Period Start Date, or if the twentieth calendar day is not a Business
Day, then the next Business Day thereafter or (ii) if the Company provides
notice to Parent that it is no longer engaged in negotiations with any
Excluded Party, five (5) Business Days after providing such notice) after the
No-Shop Period Start Date (or such earlier date as the Company determines in
its sole discretion), subject to the receipt from Parent and Merger Sub of
the information described in the second sentence of this clause (a), the
Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC, and the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall jointly file
the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy
Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the transaction contemplated hereby. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance
of, and after consultation with, Parent as provided by this Section 5.4(b))
as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement, and each of the Company and Parent shall thereafter use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond (with the assistance of, and
after consultation with, each other as provided by this Section 5.4(b)) as
promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Schedule 13E-3. If, at any time prior to the Company Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3, so that the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 or the other filings
related thereto shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties thereof, and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to
filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or making the other filings (or, in
each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and shall consider in good faith including in such document or
response comments reasonably proposed by Parent in good faith. The Company
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed or made available to holders of
Common Stock as of the record date established for the Company Meeting as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has
no further comments on the Proxy Statement, or 10 days after filing if no
comment from the SEC;  _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to
mail or make available the Proxy Statement prior to the No-Shop Period Start
Date.

 



38 Section 5.5 _Shareholders Meeting_. Subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the
NCBCA and its articles of incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the
Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ "); _provided_ that the Company
may postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting (a) with the consent of Parent,
(b) for the absence of a quorum or to solicit more proxies or (c) to allow
reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which
the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys
shareholders prior to the Company Meeting. The Company shall, through the
Company Board and the Special Committee, but subject to the right of the
Company Board or the Special Committee to make a Change of Recommendation
pursuant to Section 5.3, provide the Recommendation and shall include the
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and, unless there has been a Change
of Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.3, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the Shareholder Approval.
Parent and its Representatives shall have the right to solicit proxies in
favor of the Shareholder Approval.

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time (but not beyond
the date on which the applicable individuals employment with the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries terminates), Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current (as of the
Effective Time) employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the " _Company Employees_ "), other than Company Employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement (i) base salary or hourly wage (as applicable)
and target cash bonus opportunities that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those that were provided to the Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and benefits
(excluding equity-based compensation, change in control benefits and any
defined benefit pension plans) that are substantially similar in the aggregate
to the compensation and benefits that were provided to the Company Employee
immediately before the Effective Time (excluding equity-based compensation,
change in control benefits and any defined benefit pension plans).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if providing such benefits would result in a
violation of applicable law or adverse tax consequences, then such benefits
will not be required to be provided and will not be taken into account in
determining whether post-closing compensation and benefits are substantially
similar in the aggregate to compensation and benefits immediately before the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, (x) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to, provide to each Company Employee (other than those who are
entitled to severance benefits under a collective bargaining agreement) whose
employment terminates involuntarily during the one-year period following the
Effective Time severance benefits (other than relating to equity awards) equal
to (and on the same terms as) the severance benefits provided for under the
Company Benefit Plans covering such Company Employee that are severance
arrangements (disregarding the vesting, settlement, exercisability or other
features regarding equity awards), as in effect on the date of this Agreement
and (y) during such one-year period following the Effective Time, severance
benefits offered to each Company Employee shall be determined without taking
into account any reduction after the Effective Time in base salary paid to
such Company Employee.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits, but not for benefit accrual purposes)
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective

 



39  Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any equity-
based compensation, with respect to benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in
a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or
vision, disability and/or life benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall
(or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to) cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such employee and his or her covered dependents (but only to the extent
that such pre-existing condition restrictions or actively at work requirements
did not apply to such Person under the comparable Company Benefit Plan that
he or she was participating in prior to being covered under such New Plan),
and Parent shall cause (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to cause) any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the plan year in which such
Company Employee commences participation in such New Plan as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. This Section 5.6(b) shall not
apply to individuals receiving benefits covered hereunder under a collective
bargaining agreement.

 

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the applicable Company Benefit Plans, will occur at or
prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

(d) Parent and the Company agree that prior to the Closing the Company may
adopt a retention program for non-executive officer employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on
Section 5.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and any
successors thereto to assume, honor, fulfill and discharge the Companys and
its Subsidiaries obligations under such program in accordance with the terms
and conditions of any agreements or arrangements entered into thereunder (but
only to the extent such agreements and arrangements are consistent with
Section 5.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) nothing in
this Agreement shall obligate Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to employ (or continue to employ) any
employee for any period of time and (ii) the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries shall not be required to

party beneficiary or other rights or remedies in any current or former
employee, director, officer, consultant, independent contractor

 



40  or other service provider (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any other Person other than the parties to this Agreement and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, (y) constitute or create an
employment contract or rights to continued employment with Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries,

Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(f) The Company shall take all actions necessary to (i) suspend all
outstanding purchase rights and all participant contributions to the ESPP for
the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the earlier of the
Effective Time or the Termination Date, if any, and (ii) refund all
participant contributions held under the ESPP immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 5.7 _Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts
with respect to (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, including the Company Approvals and the
Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, including, in connection with any
Regulatory Law (all of the foregoing, collectively, the " _Governmental
Consents_ "), (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , that no party shall be required to pay (and
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall not pay or agree to pay without
the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) any fee, penalty or other
consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
contract or agreement.

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in (i)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or Governmental
Consents are required to be obtained from, any Governmental Entities
(including in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries are operating any business) and (ii) to the extent not made prior
to the date hereof, timely making or causing to be made all such applications
and filings as reasonably determined by Parent and the Company as promptly
as practicable or as required by the Law of the jurisdiction of the
Governmental Entity. Each party shall supply as promptly as practicable such
information, documentation, other material or testimony that may be requested
by any Governmental Entity, including by complying at the earliest reasonably
practicable date with any request under or with respect to the HSR Act, any
other Governmental Consent and any

 



41  such other applicable Laws for additional information, documents or other
materials received by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Entity in connection with such applications or
filings or the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the Equity Investor to supply, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, such reasonable information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may be requested by any such Governmental Entity
with respect to the Equity Investor in connection with such Governmental
Consents.

 

(c) Without limiting any of its other obligations hereunder, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such further action as may be necessary
to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice,
state antitrust enforcement authorities, or competition authorities of any
other nation or other jurisdiction (including multinational or supranational),
or any other Person, may assert under any Regulatory Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated herein, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Regulatory Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger, in each case so as to enable the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur as soon as possible
(taking into account the other conditions to Closing set forth in Sections
6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 and the Marketing Period) (and in any event no later than
the Outside Date) by proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
agreement, consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, (i) the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets, businesses, services,
products or product lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries) or behavioral limitations, conduct restrictions or commitments
with respect to any such assets, businesses, services, products or product
lines of Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries), (ii)
the creation or termination of relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries and
(iii) any other actions that would limit the freedom of action of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
(including the Companys or the Surviving Corporations) assets, businesses,
services, products or product lines, in each case as may be required in
order to obtain all required Governmental Consents as promptly as practicable
(including expirations or terminations of waiting periods whether imposed by
Law or agreement) and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or delaying any of the foregoing beyond the Outside Date (each of (i), (ii)
and (iii), a " _Divestiture Action_ "). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without Parents prior written consent, and neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without the Companys prior written
consent, discuss or commit to any extension of any waiting period under any
Regulatory Law or any agreement not to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company shall be required to take any action pursuant to this Section
5.7 unless it is expressly conditioned on the effectiveness of the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (x) neither
Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates or portfolio
companies in which the Equity Investor or any of its investment fund
Affiliates have made a debt or equity investment (other than such portfolio
companies engaged in the same line of business as the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) shall be obligated to agree to take any action, or accept any
conditions, restrictions, obligations or requirements, including any
Divestiture Action, with respect to any Affiliates or portfolio companies of
Parent or Merger Sub (as constituted and without giving effect to the Merger),
pursuant to this Section 5.7, and (y) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries 

 



42  shall agree without Parents prior written consent, to take any action, or
accept any conditions, restrictions, obligations or requirements, including
any Divestiture Action, with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
pursuant to this Section 5.7.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, each of the
Company and Parent agrees (i) to cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all registrations, filings,
notifications, communications, submissions and any other material actions
pursuant to this Section 5.7, (ii) to furnish to the other such necessary
information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of any notifications or filings, (iii) to keep each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated therein, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other communications received by such party from,
or given by such party to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger, (iv) to permit the other party to review and to
incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any communication to be
given by it to any Governmental Entity with respect to obtaining the necessary
approvals for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (v) not to participate in any meeting or discussion in person
or by telephone expected to address matters related to the transactions
contemplated herein with any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
unless, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, it gives the
other party reasonable notice thereof and the opportunity to attend and
observe and participate. The parties shall take reasonable efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege
pursuant to this Section 5.7 in a manner so as to preserve any applicable
privilege. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 5.7(d) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.7, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a Governmental Entity or any other
Person is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory
Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, without limiting the foregoing, taking the
actions set forth in Section 5.7(c) (subject to the limitations set forth
therein).

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman
Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq., the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 12, et
seq. and 29 U.S.C. §§ 52, et seq., the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 41, et seq., as amended, and all other federal, state,
foreign, multinational or supranational statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws, including,
without limitation, any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Laws, that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition and including any Laws that relate
to foreign investments.

 



43 Section 5.8 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "interested shareholder," "business combination" or other
form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall or may become applicable to
the transactions contemplated herein, each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated herein may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to
eliminate or, if not possible to eliminate, minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated herein.

 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the
issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not
issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to
such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or as may be requested by a Governmental Entity in which event such
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide a meaningful
opportunity to the other party to review and comment upon such press release
or other announcement prior to making any such press release or other
announcement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the restrictions in this
Section 5.9 shall not apply to the receipt and existence of an Acquisition
Proposal or a Change of Recommendation and (b) each party hereto and their
respective Affiliates may make statements that are substantially similar to
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent and the Company in compliance with this Section 5.9. Parent and the
Company agree to issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement and
agree that neither party shall issue such press release without the prior
consent of the other party. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent and Merger Sub may disclose the terms of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective current and
prospective Affiliates, lenders, investors and limited partners who have
confidentiality obligations to Parent or Merger Sub.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of
the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates
of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in
any agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, subject to compliance with applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and
any Company Subsidiarys certificates of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors or officers as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective Time, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at
the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the Indemnified Parties)

 



44  each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each Person who served at the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries request or direction, or for their benefit, as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(each, together with such Persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ") in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective
Time in connection with such Indemnified Partys service as a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or acts or omissions in
connection with such Indemnified Partys service as officer,
director, member, trustee or other fiduciary in any other entity if such
services were at the request, at the direction or for the benefit of the
Company); _provided_ , that any Person to whom any funds are advanced pursuant
to the foregoing must, if required by Law, provide an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification. In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , that if the aggregate
annual premium for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual
premium for such insurance (which is identified on Section 5.10(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter), then Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided, a policy for the applicable individuals with as much coverage as can
reasonably be obtained in its good faith judgment at a cost up to but not
exceeding 300% of such current annual premium. At the Companys option (or,
if requested by Parent, the Company shall), the Company may purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated herein; _provided_ , that the aggregate premium for such
insurance policy shall not exceed 300 % of the current annual premium for such
insurance. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party
shall have any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, Parent shall or shall cause to be paid all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity, advancement and other
obligations provided in this Section 5.10.

(e) Solely with respect to actions or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred before or at the Effective Time in connection with an Indemnified
Partys service as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such

 



45  Indemnified Party may have under the certificates of incorporation or bylaws
or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement, the NCBCA
or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

 

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.10.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors or officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their officers or directors, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 5.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

 

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its operations. Notwithstanding the fact that the Company Chairman and CEO is
a Rollover Investor, this Section 5.11 shall not apply to limit the Company
Chairman and CEO in his capacity as a director of the Company, Chairman of the
Company Board or Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

Section 5.12 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be
obtained, the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Commitment Letters, including using its reasonable best efforts with
respect to, (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiating
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive
Agreements_ ") consistent in all material respects with the terms and
conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter) or, if available, on other terms that are
acceptable to Parent and would not adversely affect (including with respect to
timing, taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated herein
and (iii) satisfying all conditions applicable to Parent and its Subsidiaries
to obtaining the Financing that are within Parent or Merger Subs control. In
the event that all conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and
Definitive Agreements have been satisfied (or upon funding will be
satisfied), Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
timely cause the Lenders to fund the Debt Financing, as applicable.

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, (i) terminate any Commitment Letter, unless such Commitment Letter
is replaced in a manner consistent with the following clause (ii), or (ii)
permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, or replace, the Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification, waiver, or replacement (A) would (1) add any new (or
adversely modify any existing) condition to the Financing Commitments or
otherwise adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated

 



46  by this Agreement or the likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub doing so or (2)
make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the
conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur, (B) reduces the
amount of the Debt Financing unless the Equity Financing and/or the Rollover
Investment is increased by a corresponding amount, (C) adversely affects the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, or (D) could reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Upon any such
amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Financing Commitments or the
Equity Financing Commitment or the Rollover Contribution Agreement in
accordance with this Section 5.12(b), the terms "Debt Financing Commitments"
and "Equity Financing Commitment" and "Rollover Contribution Agreement" shall
mean the Debt Financing Commitments, the Equity Financing Commitment and
Rollover Contribution Agreement, respectively, as so amended, supplemented or
modified or replaced.

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub,
the reason therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative
financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with other sources of
funds available to Parent, to replace such unavailable portion) from the same
or other sources and on terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent than
such unavailable Debt Financing and which would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Financing or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of and not in
limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, but the
bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (or alternative
bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 5.12(c)) are
available on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
(or replacements thereof), then Parent shall cause the proceeds of such
bridge financing to be used in lieu of such contemplated Debt Financing. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter" "Fee
Letter" and "Debt Financing Commitments" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment or any fee letter
referred to in such commitment letter with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter and
Debt Financing Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question). For
the purposes of this Agreement, the terms "Equity Commitment Letter" and
"Equity Financing Commitment" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) or commitment with respect to any
alternative financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Equity
Commitment Letter and Equity Financing Commitment remaining in effect at the
time in question).

 

(d) Parent shall provide the Company with prompt oral and written notice (i)
of (A) any material breach or default by any party to any Commitment Letters
or the Definitive Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub has Knowledge or
any termination of any of the Commitment Letters, (B) the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication to Parent or Merger Sub from
any Lender, Equity Investor, Rollover Investor or other financing source with
respect to any actual or threatened breach, default (or any accusation of
breach or default), termination or repudiation by any party to any
Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements or any provision thereof or
(C) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
of the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements with respect 

 



47  to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at Closing, and (ii) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under
any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (A) or (B) that
is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent and Merger Sub
shall have used their reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in
a way that would not waive such privilege. In the event that Parent or Merger
Sub do not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding
sentence, Parent or Merger Sub shall provide notice to the Company that such
access or information is being withheld and Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible,
the applicable information in a way that would not violate the applicable
obligation or risk waiver of such privilege. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 8.5(b), compliance by
Parent with this Section 5.12 shall not relieve Parent of its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Financing is available.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, provide and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing (including any offering or private placement of
debt securities) as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including using
reasonable best efforts to:

(i) furnish Parent and the Lenders as promptly as practicable with financial
information and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, monthly consolidated statements
of income and monthly balance sheets, as may be reasonably requested by Parent
to consummate the Financing as is customary to be included in (A) marketing
materials for senior secured or unsecured indebtedness (or any documentation
or deliverables in connection therewith) and (B) all other information and
data necessary for the Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy the conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (all such information described in this
clause (i), the " _Required Information_ "; _provided_ , that with respect to
any pro forma and summary financial data provided pursuant to clauses (A) and
(B) above, such pro forma and summary financial data shall not be considered a
part of the Required Information unless Parent has provided the Company with
notice reasonably in advance of when the Marketing Period otherwise would
begin if the Required Information did not include such pro forma and summary
financial data any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization, ownership or other post-Closing pro forma adjustments desired
to be incorporated into any information used in connection with the Debt
Financing);

(ii) participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, meetings with prospective lenders, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing,
and assisting with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations, roadshow presentations, offering memoranda, bank
information memoranda (including, to the extent necessary, an additional bank
information memorandum that does not include material non-public information)
and similar documents required in connection with the Debt Financing

 



48  ( _provided_ , _however_ , that any such bank information memoranda,
offering documents, or similar documents are not required to be distributed by
the Company or its Subsidiaries) and otherwise reasonably cooperate in the
marketing efforts related to the Debt Financing, including, as reasonably
requested, prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date;

 

(iii) obtain consents and customary comfort letters of independent accountants
(including "negative assurance" comfort), legal opinions, surveys and title
insurance as reasonably requested by Parent as necessary and customary for
financings similar to the Financing (including any offering or private
placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act);

(iv) assist in the preparation of a customary confidential information
memorandum, rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents for the facilities and other customary marketing materials to be
used in connection with the syndications reasonably deemed necessary by the
lead arranger of the Debt Financing to complete a successful syndication
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter;

 

(v) assist Parent in procuring a public corporate credit rating and a public
corporate family rating in respect of the relevant borrower under the
facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and public ratings for
any of the facilities or notes issued in connection with the Debt Financing;

 

(vi) assist in the preparation of (and execute and deliver) one or more
credit, indenture, purchase or other agreements, as well as any pledge,
security, guaranty and mortgage documents, and other definitive financing
documents, collateral filings or other certificates or documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise reasonably facilitating
the pledging of collateral and taking all necessary corporate or other entity
actions to facilitate all of the foregoing ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
none of such indentures, agreements, documents or certificates will be
executed and delivered except in connection with the Closing, (B) the
effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become effective after,
the occurrence of the Closing and (C) no personal liability will be imposed on
the officers or employees involved);

(vii) furnish Parent, Merger Sub and the Lenders with (A) such pertinent and
customary information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than

Section 8.5 _Remedies; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Each party agrees that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether
in law or equity, including monetary damages) to (i) a decree or order
of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to the granting of a decree or order of specific performance or
other equitable relief of Parents obligation to cause the full funding of (i)
the Equity Financing under the Equity Commitment Letter and (ii) the Rollover
Investment and to consummate the Merger if and only in the event each of the
following conditions has been satisfied: (w) all of the conditions in Sections
6.1 and 6.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but each of which at such time is capable of being
satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, (x) each of the Debt Financing or
any alternative financing obtained in accordance with Section 5.12, has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing and
Rollover Investment are funded at the Closing, (y) the Marketing Period has
ended and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the Outside
Date and (z) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to
Parent and the Lenders that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing and that if decree or order of specific performance or other equitable
relief is granted and the Equity Financing, the Rollover Investment and the
Debt Financing are funded, the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of a decree or order of
specific performance or other equitable relief as and only to the extent
expressly permitted by this Section 8.5(b) with respect to the matters
identified in clauses (i) and (ii) above and to consummate the Merger and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted
by Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.3(c), respectively), under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both (A) such grant of a
decree or order of specific performance or other equitable relief to cause the
funding of the

 



59  financing described in clauses (i) and (ii) above and to consummate the
Merger and (B) payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

(c) Each party further agrees that (i) it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein (including the limitations set forth in Section 8.5(b)) on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and
(ii) no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5, and each
party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be 

 



61  only so broad as is enforceable; _provided_ , that the parties intend that

of Merger Sub, as applicable, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver
shall be subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company or the
sole shareholder of Merger Sub, as applicable; _provided_ ,  _further_ that
the failure of any party to assert any rights or remedies shall not constitute
a waiver of such rights or remedies.
