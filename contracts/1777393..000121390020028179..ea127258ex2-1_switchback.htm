such claims are collectively referred to in this <U>Section&nbsp;6.03</U> as the &ldquo;<B><U>Claims</U></B>&rdquo;). Notwithstanding
any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Company hereby irrevocably waives any Claim it may have, now or in the future
and will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in respect thereof; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>,

person (a)&nbsp;for legal relief against monies or other assets of Switchback or Merger Sub held outside of the Trust Account or
for specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with the Transactions or (b)&nbsp;for damages for breach of this
Agreement against Switchback (or any successor entity) or Merger Sub in the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason and
Switchback consummates a business combination transaction with another party. In the event that the Company commences any action
or proceeding against or involving the Trust Fund in violation of the foregoing, Switchback shall be entitled to recover from the
Company the associated reasonable legal fees and costs in connection with any such action, in the event Switchback prevails in
such action or proceeding.</P>
