Article III 
  
  _Effects of the Merger_

  



  

3.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to receipt of the
Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall cause each share of
Company Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be automatically converted into a number of shares of
Company Common Stock at the then-effective conversion rate as calculated
pursuant to Article IV(C)4(a)(i) of the Company Certificate of Incorporation
(the " _Conversion_ "). After the Conversion, all of the shares of Company
Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such securities.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Switchback, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:

  



  

(i) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including shares of Company Common Stock
resulting from the Conversion, but excluding shares of Company Restricted
Stock) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive (A) the
number of shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio and (B) the contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares in
accordance with _Section 3.03_ , in each case without interest (collectively,
the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ");

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(ii) all shares of Company Stock held in the treasury of the Company shall be
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto; and

  



  

(iii) each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Warrant, to the extent
then outstanding and unexercised, shall automatically, without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into (i) a warrant to acquire a
number of shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock at an adjusted exercise
price per share, in each case, as determined under this _Section 3.01(c)_
(each such resulting warrant, an " _Assumed Warrant_ ") and (ii) the
contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares in accordance with _Section
3.03_. Each Assumed Warrant shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding
former Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the
extent such terms or conditions are rendered inoperative by the Transactions.
Accordingly, effective as of the Effective Time: (a) each Assumed Warrant
shall be exercisable solely for shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock; (b)
the number of shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock subject to each
Assumed Warrant shall be equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the applicable Company Warrant _multiplied_ by (2) the
Exchange Ratio, rounding the resulting number down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock; and (c) the per
share exercise price for the Switchback Class A Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Warrant shall be equal to (x) the per share exercise
price for the shares of Company Common Stock subject to the applicable
Company Warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_divided_ by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounding the resulting exercise price up
to the nearest whole cent. Switchback shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such
reservation for so long as any of the Assumed Warrants remain outstanding, a
sufficient number of shares Switchback Class A Common Stock for delivery upon
the exercise of such Assumed Warrants.

  



  

(d) Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into (i) in the case of Company
Options that are vested or unvested, an option to purchase a number of shares
of Switchback Class A Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
(such option, an " _Exchanged Option_ ") equal to (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the exercise
price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, _divided by_ (2) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to the Exchanged Options shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the case of any Exchanged Option to which Section 422 of
the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Switchback
Class A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined
in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are
necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code
(including that share amounts will be rounded down to the nearest whole
number and exercise prices will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
and (ii) solely in the case of Company Options that are vested, the
contingent right to receive the Earnout Shares in accordance with  _Section
3.03_. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each Exchanged Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions (including vesting and exercisability terms) as were applicable to
the corresponding former Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except to the extent such terms or conditions are rendered
inoperative by the Merger or any related transactions; _provided_ , that
Exchanged Options resulting from the conversion of Company Options issued
under the 2017 Company Stock Plan shall be exercisable only to the extent
vested.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(e) Each award of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an award with respect to
a number of restricted shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock (rounded up
or down to the nearest whole number, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up) (such
award of restricted shares, " _Exchanged Restricted Stock_ ") equal to (A)
the number of shares of Company Restricted Stock subject to such award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the Exchange
Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each award of Exchanged Restricted Stock shall continue to be governed by the
same terms and conditions (including vesting and repurchase terms) as were
applicable to the corresponding former Company Restricted Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such terms or conditions
are rendered inoperative by the Merger and any related transactions.

  



  

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, the parties and their boards, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.01(b)_ , the treatment of the Company Warrants pursuant to
_Section 3.01(c)_ and the treatment of the Company Options pursuant to
_Section 3.01(d)_ , the treatment of the Company Restricted Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.01(e)_ or to cause any disposition or acquisition of equity
securities of Switchback pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ , _Section 3.01(c)_,
_Section 3.01(d)_ or _Section 3.01(e)_ , by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, with
respect to Switchback or who will (or is reasonably expected to) become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Switchback to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Effective as of the Effective
Time or as soon thereafter as permitted under applicable Law, Switchback
shall file an appropriate registration statement or registration statements
with respect to the shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock subject to the
Assumed Warrants and Exchanged Options and shall maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such awards remain outstanding.

  



  

(g) Pursuant to the terms of the Switchback Certificate of Incorporation, the
Switchback Founders Stock will convert into Switchback Class A Common Stock
at the Closing. All of the shares of Switchback Founders Stock converted into
shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Switchback Founders Stock shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Switchback shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be
designated by Switchback and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of the Company Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ , the number of shares of
Switchback Class A Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such shares of
Switchback Class A Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Switchback shall cause the Exchange
Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay the Per Share Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement.
Except as contemplated by _Section 3.02(c)_ hereof, the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
Switchback shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of Company Stock evidenced by certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") entitled to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_: a letter of transmittal, which
shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Switchback and the Company (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and shall specify (1) that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and (2)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to the Letter of Transmittal. Within two (2) Business Days (but in no event
prior to the Effective Time) after the surrender to the Exchange Agent of all
Certificates held by such holder for cancellation, together with a Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefore, and Switchback shall cause the Exchange Agent
to deliver the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration (other than any
Earnout Shares) in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.01_, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.02_, each Certificate entitled to receive the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.01_
shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 3.01_.

  



  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Switchback Class A
Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Switchback Class A Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Switchback Class A
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with _Section 3.02(b)_. Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, Switchback shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder
of the shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock issued in exchange therefore,
without interest, (i) promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business
Days of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such shares of Switchback
Class A Common Stock.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration payable upon conversion of the Company Stock (including shares
of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion of Company Preferred
Stock described in _Section 3.01(a)_) or pursuant to _Section 3.03_ in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock.

  



  

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Switchback Class A Common Stock or the Company
Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that this _Section 3.01(e)_ shall not be construed to
permit Switchback or the Company to take any actions with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by this Agreement.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Switchback, upon demand, and any holders
of Company Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 3.02_
shall thereafter look only to Switchback for the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration, other than as provided in _Section 3.03_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Company Stock as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any government entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Switchback free and clear
of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Switchback or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Stock (including shares
of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion of Company Preferred
Stock described in _Section 3.01(a)_) for any Switchback Class A Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law in accordance with this _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub,
Switchback and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from amounts (including shares, warrants, options or other property)
otherwise payable, issuable or transferable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of a Company Warrant, a Company Option, Company Restricted Stock or
Company Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the
conversion of Company Preferred Stock described in _Section 3.01(a)_), such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment, issuance or transfer under the United States Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law.
As soon as reasonably practicable prior to making any deduction or
withholding pursuant to this _Section 3.02(h)_ , the Surviving Corporation,
Merger Sub, Switchback or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) provide written notice to the Company of any
anticipated deduction or withholding (together with the legal basis
therefor), (ii) cooperate in good faith and (iii) reduce or eliminate any
amounts that would otherwise be deducted or withheld. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and timely paid to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid, issued or transferred
to the holder of the Company Warrant, the Company Option, the Company
Restricted Stock or the Company Stock (or intended recipients of compensatory
payments) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent

other laws of general application affecting enforcement of creditors' rights
generally, by general equitable principles (the " _Remedies Exceptions_ ").

rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result
in the creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Material
Contract, except, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or
other occurrences which, individually or in the aggregate, (x) with respect
to _clause (ii)_, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and (y) with respect to _clause (iii)_ , have
not been, and would not reasonably be expected to be, material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties in all
respects and to carry on its business in all respects as it is now being
conducted (each, a " _Company Permit_ "), except where the failure to do so,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, no suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default,
breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to the Company or any Company

Switchback's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the

with the terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or
default thereunder and there does not exist any event which, with the giving

Switchback or the Trustee. There are no separate contracts, agreements, side

released except: (1) to pay income and franchise Taxes from any
interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (2) upon the exercise of

with respect to the Trust Account. Upon consummation of the Merger and notice
thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, Switchback shall
cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release
to Switchback as promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with
the Trust Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the liabilities and obligations of Switchback
due and owing or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid

Switchback who shall have exercised their Redemption Rights, (ii) with

full and complete access to the Representatives, properties, offices, plants
and other facilities, books and records of the Company and any Company
Subsidiary and other information that they have requested in connection with
their investigation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the
Transactions. Neither Switchback nor Merger Sub is relying on any statement,
representation or warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
Representatives, except as expressly set forth in _Article IV_ (as modified
by the Company Disclosure Schedule) or in the corresponding
representations and warranties contained in the certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 8.02(c)_. Neither the Company nor any of its
respective stockholders, affiliates or Representatives shall have any
liability to Switchback, Merger Sub or any of their respective
stockholders, affiliates or Representatives resulting from the use of any
information, documents or materials made available to Switchback or Merger
Sub or any of their Representatives, whether orally or in writing, in any
confidential information memoranda, "data rooms," management presentations,
due diligence discussions or in any other form in expectation of the
Transactions, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (as modified by
the Company Disclosure Schedule) or in any certificate delivered by
the Company pursuant to this Agreement. Switchback and Merger Sub acknowledge

5.20 _Founders Stock Letter_. Switchback has delivered to the Company a true,
correct and complete copy of the Founders Stock Letter. No withdrawal,
termination, amendment or modification of the Founders Stock Letter is
contemplated by Switchback and, to the knowledge of Switchback, the Founders
Stock Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or
terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, in any material respect. The
Founders Stock Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Switchback
and, to the knowledge of Switchback, the other Founder Stockholders. To the
knowledge of Switchback, neither the execution nor delivery by the Founder
Stockholders of, nor the performance of any of the Founder Stockholders'
obligations under, the Founders Stock Letter violates any provision of, or
results in the breach of or default under, or requires any filing,
registration or qualification under, any applicable Law (other than as
required under applicable securities laws and as otherwise contemplated herein
or in the other Transaction Documents). No event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Switchback under any material term or condition of the Founders
Stock Letter.

any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Company does not now
have, and shall not at any time prior to the Effective Time have, any claim
to, or make any claim against, the Trust Fund, regardless of whether such
claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, the
business relationship between the Company on the one hand, and Switchback on
the other hand, this Agreement, or any other agreement or any other
matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort,
equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are
collectively referred to in this _Section 6.03_ as the " _Claims_ ").
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Company
hereby irrevocably waives any Claim it may have, now or in the future and
will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in
respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing waiver will not

Sub or any other person (a) for legal relief against monies or other assets
of Switchback or Merger Sub held outside of the Trust Account or for specific
performance or other equitable relief in connection with the Transactions or
(b) for damages for breach of this Agreement against Switchback (or any

Switchback shall be entitled to recover from the Company the associated
reasonable legal fees and costs in connection with any such action, in the

as of the date of this Agreement, shall be reasonably acceptable to
Switchback), (E) approval and adoption of a customary equity incentive plan
(the " _Omnibus Incentive Plan_ ") in form and substance reasonably acceptable

(G) collectively, the " _Required Switchback Proposals_ ," and together with
clauses (D), (E) and (F), the " _Switchback Proposals_ "). Each of the Company
and Switchback shall furnish all information concerning such party as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with such actions and

the Company each shall use their reasonable best efforts to (w) cause the

promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments received from
the SEC concerning the Merger Materials, (y) cause the Registration Statement

(c) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Merger Materials will be
made by Switchback without the approval of the Company (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Switchback will advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, of the issuance of any stop order, or of the suspension of the
qualification of the Switchback Class A Common Stock to be issued or issuable
to the stockholders of the Company in connection with this Agreement for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Switchback will advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for

written correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, or, if not in
writing, a description of such communication, with respect to the Merger

of the SEC relating to the Merger Materials will be made by Switchback
without the prior consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon unless pursuant to a
telephone call initiated by the SEC.

inclusion in the Merger Materials shall not, at (i) the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the Merger Materials are mailed
to their respective stockholders and (iii) the time of the Switchback
Stockholders' Meeting, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
relating to Switchback or Merger Sub, or their respective officers or
directors, should be discovered by Switchback which should be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the Merger Materials, Switchback shall promptly
inform the Company.

inclusion in the Merger Materials shall not, at (i) the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time Merger Materials are mailed to
their respective stockholders and (iii) the time of the Switchback
Stockholders' Meeting, include any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements

misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or
circumstance relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or its
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Merger Materials, the Company
shall promptly inform Switchback.

  



  

7.03 _Consent Solicitation; Written Consent; Company Change in
Recommendation_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Registration
Statement becomes effective, the Company shall solicit the Requisite Company
Stockholder Approval via written consent in accordance with Section 228 of the
DGCL. In connection therewith, prior to the date upon which the Registration
Statement becomes effective, the Company Board shall set a record date for
determining the stockholders of the Company entitled to provide such written
consent. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Key
Company Stockholder to duly execute and deliver a stockholder written consent
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (the " _Written
Consent_ ") in respect of the shares of Company Stock beneficially owned by
such Key Company Stockholder (which Key Company Stockholders hold shares of
Company Stock sufficient constitute Company Stockholder Approval) in
accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL within forty-eight (48) hours of the
Registration Statement becoming effective. As promptly as practicable
following the execution and delivery of the Written Consent by the Key Company
Stockholders to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Switchback a copy
of such Written Consent in accordance with _Section 10.01_. Promptly
following the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval via the
Written Consent and delivery to Switchback of a copy of such Written Consent
in accordance with _Section 10.01_ , the Company will prepare (subject to the
reasonable approval of Switchback) and deliver to the stockholders of the
Company who have not executed and delivered the Written Consent the notice
required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and include a description of the
appraisal rights of the stockholders of the Company available under
Section 262 of the DGCL along with such other information as is required
thereunder and pursuant to applicable Law. If the Key Company Stockholders
fail to deliver the Written Consent to the Company within forty-eight (48)
hours of the Registration Statement becoming effective (a " _Written Consent
Failure_ "), Switchback shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as
set forth in _Section 9.01_.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(b) The Consent Solicitation Statement shall include the Company
Recommendation. Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall: (i) withdraw, modify, amend or qualify (or propose to withdraw,
modify, amend or qualify publicly) the Company Recommendation, or fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Consent Solicitation Statement; (ii)
approve, recommend or declare advisable (or publicly propose to do so) any
Alternative Transaction; (iii) fail to publicly announce, within ten (10)
Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to the equity
securities of the Company shall have been commenced by any third party other
than Switchback and its affiliates, a statement disclosing that the Company
Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer (for the
avoidance of doubt, the taking of no position or a neutral position by the
Company Board in respect of the acceptance of any such tender offer or
exchange offer as of the end of such period shall constitute a failure to
publicly announce that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender
or exchange offer); or (iv) if requested by Switchback, fail to issue, within
ten (10) Business Days after an Alternative Transaction (other than any tender
offer or exchange offer) is publicly announced, a press release reaffirming
the Company Recommendation (any action described in clauses (i) through (iv)
being referred to as a " _Company Change in Recommendation_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that failure to effect a
Company Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, then the Company Board may effect a Company Change in
Recommendation so long as the Company (to the extent lawful and reasonably
practicable) first provides Switchback with at least 48 hours advance written
notice of such withdrawal or modification.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding (i) any Company Change in Recommendation, (ii) the making
of any inquiry or proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction or
(iii) anything to the contrary contained herein, unless this Agreement has
been earlier validly terminated in accordance with  _Section 9.01_ , (A) in
no event shall the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries execute or enter
into any agreement in principle, confidentiality agreement, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, term sheet, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other written arrangement relating to any
Alternative Transaction or terminate this Agreement in connection therewith
and (B) the Company shall otherwise remain subject to the terms of this
Agreement, including the Company's obligation to use reasonable best efforts
to cause each Key Company Stockholder to duly execute and deliver the Written
Consent and to otherwise solicit the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval in
accordance with _Section 7.03(a)_.

  



  

7.04 _Switchback Stockholders ' Meeting; and Merger Sub Stockholder's
Approval_.

  



  

(a) Switchback shall call and hold the Switchback Stockholders' Meeting as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement
becomes effective for the purpose of voting solely upon the Switchback
Proposals, and Switchback shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the
Switchback Stockholders' Meeting as soon as practicable after the date on
which the Registration Statement becomes effective; _provided_ , that
Switchback may (or, upon the receipt of a request to do so from the
Company, shall) postpone or adjourn the Switchback Stockholders' Meeting on
one or more occasions for up to 45 days in the aggregate to the extent that
such postponement or adjournment is reasonably necessary to solicit additional
proxies to obtain approval of the Switchback Proposals or otherwise take
actions consistent with Switchback's obligations pursuant to _Section
7.09_. Switchback shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
approval of the Switchback Proposals at the Switchback Stockholders' Meeting,
including by soliciting from its stockholders proxies as promptly as possible
in favor of the Switchback Proposals, and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the required vote or consent of its
stockholders. The Switchback Board shall recommend to its stockholders that
they approve the Switchback Proposals (the " _Switchback Recommendation_
") and shall include the Switchback Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
Neither the Switchback Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) withdraw,
modify, amend or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify, amend or qualify
publicly) the Switchback Recommendation, or fail to include the Switchback
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable (or publicly propose to do so) any Switchback Alternative
Transaction (any action described in clauses (i) through (ii) being referred
to as a " _Switchback Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Switchback Board, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that failure to effect a Switchback Change
in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Switchback under applicable Law, then
the Switchback Board may effect a Switchback Change in Recommendation so long
as Switchback (to the extent lawful and reasonably practicable) first
provides the Company with at least 48 hours advance written notice of such
withdrawal or modification.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding (i) any Switchback Change in Recommendation, (ii) the
making of any inquiry or proposal with respect to a Switchback
Alternative Transaction or (iii) anything to the contrary contained herein,
unless this Agreement has been earlier validly terminated in accordance with
_Section 9.01_ , (A) in no event shall Switchback or Merger Sub execute or
enter into any agreement in principle, confidentiality agreement, letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other written arrangement relating to any Switchback Alternative
Transaction or terminate this Agreement in connection therewith and (B)
Switchback and Merger Sub shall otherwise remain subject to the terms of this
Agreement, including Switchback's obligation to use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the approval of the Switchback Proposals at the Switchback
Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with _Section 7.04(a)_.

  



  

(c) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Switchback shall
approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub.

  



  

7.05 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and
Switchback shall (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to): (i)
provide to the other party (and the other party's officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access
at reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of such party and its Subsidiaries
and to the books and records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly to the other
party such information concerning the business, properties, contracts,
assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such party and its
Subsidiaries as the other party or its Representatives may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Switchback
shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where the
access or disclosure would jeopardize the protection of attorney-
client privilege or contravene applicable Law (it being agreed that the
parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to
be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy or
contravention).

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(b) All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this _Section 7.05_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement,
dated August 3, 2020 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between
Switchback and the Company.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party
(and its respective Representatives) may consult any Tax advisor as is
reasonably necessary regarding the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Transactions and may disclose to such advisor as if reasonably necessary, the
intended Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Transactions and all materials
(including any Tax analysis) that are provided relating to such treatment or
structure, in each case in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

7.06 _Incentive Equity Plan; ESPP_. The Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal shall
provide that a number of shares of Switchback Class A Common Stock, which
number shall be mutually agreed upon between Switchback and the Company, shall
be reserved for issuance pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The ESPP
Proposal shall provide that a number of shares of Switchback Class A Common
Stock, which number shall be mutually agreed upon between Switchback and the
Company, shall be reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. Subject to
approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal and/or the ESPP Proposal,
following the Effective Time Switchback shall cause the issuance of shares of
Switchback Class A Common Stock under the Omnibus Incentive Plan and/or the
ESPP, as applicable, to be registered with the SEC on a Form S-8 Registration
Statement.

  



  

7.07 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
exculpation, advancement or expense reimbursement than are set forth in the
charter or bylaws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such modification
shall be required by applicable Law. Switchback further agrees that with
respect to the provisions of the charter, bylaws or limited liability company
agreements of the Company Subsidiaries relating to indemnification,
exculpation, advancement or expense reimbursement, such provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of such Company
Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law. For
a period of six years from the Effective Time, Switchback agrees that it
shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have
been permitted under applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation
or the bylaws of the Company, the charter, bylaws or limited
liability company agreements of the Company Subsidiary, or any
indemnification agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify or exculpate such person (including the advancing of expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Switchback shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, exculpation,
advancement or expense reimbursement than are set forth as of the date hereof
in the charter or bylaws of Switchback and the Merger Sub, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights
thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of Switchback,
unless such modification shall be required by applicable Law. Switchback
further agrees that with respect to the provisions of the charter or bylaws of
Switchback as of the date hereof relating to indemnification, exculpation,
advancement or expense reimbursement, such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries or agents of Switchback, unless such
modification shall be required by applicable Law. For a period of six years
from the Effective Time, Switchback agrees that it shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of Switchback against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that Switchback would have been permitted under applicable Law, the
Switchback certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of Switchback or the
Merger Sub, or any indemnification agreement in effect on the date of this
Agreement to indemnify or exculpate such person (including the advancing of
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).

  



  

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Switchback shall
maintain in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance (" _D andO
Insurance_") covering those persons who are currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (true, correct
and complete copies of which have been heretofore made available to
Switchback or its agents or Representatives) (the " _Company D andO Insurance_")
on terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage, except that in no event shall Switchback be required to pay an
annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual
premium payable by the Company for such insurance policy for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "). If the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then Switchback
will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the Company DandO
Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier so
long as the aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior
to the Effective Time, Switchback will maintain such "tail" policy in full
force and effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective
Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder. If the Company is
unable to obtain the "tail" policy and Switchback is unable to obtain the
insurance described in this _Section 7.07(b)_ for an amount less than or
equal to the Maximum Annual Premium, Switchback will instead obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Annual Premium.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Switchback may purchase a prepaid "tail"
policy (a " _Switchback Tail Policy_ ") with respect to the DandO Insurance
covering those persons who are currently covered by Switchback's directors'
and officers' liability insurance policies (the " _Switchback D andO
Insurance_"). If Switchback elects to purchase such a Switchback Tail Policy
prior to the Effective Time, Switchback will maintain such Switchback Tail
Policy in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after
the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

  



  

(e) With respect to any claims that may be made under the Company DandO
Insurance or the Switchback DandO Insurance or any applicable "tail" policies,
(i) prior to the Effective Time, Switchback and the Company shall cooperate
with the other party as reasonably requested by such other Party, and (ii)
after the Effective Time, Switchback shall cooperate with any person
insured by such policies as reasonably requested by such Person. For the
avoidance of doubt, any DandO Insurance intended to cover claims arising out of
or pertaining to matters existing or occurring after the Effective Time (the "
_Go-forward D andO Insurance_") shall be a post-Closing expense of Switchback.

  



  

(f) On the Closing Date, Switchback shall enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and
Switchback with the post-Closing directors and officers of Switchback, which
indemnification agreements shall continue to be effective following the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification agreements with the
pre-Closing directors and officers of Switchback in effect as of the date
hereof and listed on _Section 7.07(f) of the Switchback Disclosure Schedule_
 shall continue to be effective following the Closing, and Switchback shall
continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, any costs incurred by Switchback pursuant to
this _Section 7.07_ shall not constitute a Switchback Transaction Cost.

  



  

7.08 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Switchback, and Switchback shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any
event which a party becomes aware of between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ ), the occurrence, or non-occurrence of which causes or would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Article
VIII_ to fail. For clarity, unintentional failure to give notice under this
_Section 7.08_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this
_Section 7.08_ and shall constitute only a breach of the underlying
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition, as the case may
be.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

7.09 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, such things as
are necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise, and
each shall cooperate with the other, to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of,
and the expiration or termination of waiting periods by, Governmental
Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as set forth in _Section 4.05_ necessary for the consummation of
the Transactions and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger. In case, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party shall use their reasonable best efforts to take
all such action.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other
parties of any communication it or any of its affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement and permitting the other parties to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable consult about, any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. No party
to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting, or video or
telephone conference, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other
parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting or conference. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other parties
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will provide each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications, including
any documents, information and data contained therewith, between them or
any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions contemplated hereby. No party shall take or cause to be taken any
action before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with or
intended to delay its action on requests for a consent or the consummation of
the Transactions.

  



  

(c) Except to the extent provided in writing by the Company, Switchback shall
not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, permit any waiver (in
whole or in part) of or provide consent to (including consent to termination),
any provision or remedy under any of the Subscription Agreements in a manner
adverse to the Company. Switchback shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable to (i) consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Subscription Agreements on the terms and conditions described therein,
including maintaining in effect the Subscription Agreements and enforcing the
terms thereof, (ii) satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis all
conditions and covenants applicable to Switchback in the Subscription
Agreements and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) in the
event that all conditions in the Subscription Agreements (other than
conditions that Switchback or any of its affiliates control the
satisfaction of and other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied, consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Subscription Agreements at or prior to Closing; (iv)
confer with the Company regarding timing of the Closing (as defined in the
Subscription Agreements); and (v) deliver notices to counterparties to the
Subscription Agreements sufficiently in advance of the Closing to cause them
to fund their obligations as far in advance of the Closing as permitted
by the Subscription Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Switchback shall give the Company, prompt written notice: (A) of
any amendment to any Subscription Agreement; (B) of any breach or default (or
any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, could give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any
Subscription Agreement known to Switchback; (C) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication from any party to any
Subscription Agreement with respect to any actual, potential, threatened or
claimed expiration, lapse, withdrawal, breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any Subscription Agreement or any provisions of
any Subscription Agreement; and (D) if Switchback does not expect to receive
all or any portion of the PIPE Investment Amount on the terms, in the manner
or from the PIPE Investors as contemplated by the Subscription Agreements.

7.10 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been agreed to
by each of Switchback and the Company. Thereafter, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article IX_ ) unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
Law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, each of Switchback
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements (including through social media platforms) with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement (including through
social media platforms) without the prior written consent of the other party.
Furthermore, nothing contained in this _Section 7.10_ shall prevent
Switchback or the Company and/or its respective affiliates from furnishing
customary or other reasonable information concerning the Transactions to their
investors and prospective investors that is substantively consistent with
public statements previously consented to by the other party in accordance
with this _Section 7.10_.

  



  

7.11 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Switchback will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Switchback Class A Common Stock issued in connection
with the Transactions (including the Earnout Shares) to be approved for
listing on the New York Stock Exchange at Closing. During the period from the
date hereof until the Closing, Switchback shall use its reasonable best
efforts to keep the Switchback Units, Switchback Class A Common Stock and
Switchback Warrants listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

  



  

7.12 _Antitrust_.

  



  

(a) To the extent required under any Laws that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization
or restraint of trade, including the HSR Act (" _Antitrust Laws_ "), each

7.14 _Tax Matters_. This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties
hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of
Switchback, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to: (a)(i) cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (including,
if the Company and Switchback jointly determine it is advisable after
consultation with their respective tax advisors, considering a merger of the
Company with and into Switchback, or an entity disregarded as separate from
Switchback for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, promptly after Closing to
qualify such merger and the Merger, taken together, as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code in accordance with IRS
Rev. Rul. 2001-46), and (ii) not (and not permit or cause any of their
affiliates, subsidiaries or Representatives to) take any action which to its
knowledge could reasonably be expected to materially prevent or impede the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, (b) report the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code unless otherwise required pursuant to a
change in applicable law, including attaching the statement described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3(a) on or with its Tax Return for the
taxable year of the Merger, and (c) cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue the Company's historic business or use a significant portion of the
Company's historic business assets in a business, in each case, to the extent
required pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d). For the avoidance
of doubt, except as otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, no party
(or its respective affiliates and owners) shall be required to satisfy its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ by altering the consideration
payable pursuant to _Article III_. To the extent the parties reasonably
determine the Transactions qualify as a tax-free incorporation pursuant to
Section 351 of the Code, either in addition to or in lieu of the

similar obligations as set forth in this _Section 7.14_ in respect of such

not later than 30 days from the date of this Agreement.

  



  

7.19 _Side Letter and Investor Agreements_. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to use reasonable

10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that State. All legal actions and
proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery Court; _provided_ , that if
jurisdiction is not then available in the Delaware Chancery Court, then any
such legal Action may be brought in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The parties hereto hereby (a)
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
themselves and with respect to their respective properties for the purpose of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party
hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any Action relating thereto except in
the courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the Transactions, (c) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described
herein for any reason, (d) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (e) that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

10.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial
by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the
parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.07_.

  



  

10.08 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

10.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including
by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

10.10 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof, and,
accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties'
obligation to consummate the Merger) in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, County of Newcastle, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction,
any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware without proof
of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity as expressly permitted in this Agreement.
Each of the parties hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for
specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement under any Law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Outside Date any party initiates an Action to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, then the Outside Date will be automatically
extended by: (1) the amount of time during which such Action is pending plus
20 Business Days; or (2) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action.

10.11 _No Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise, or
granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any
other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or
relate in any manner to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance or non-performance of this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement
or the other Transaction Documents), may be made only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the persons that are
expressly identified as parties to this Agreement or the applicable
Transaction Document (the " _Contracting Parties_ ") except as set forth in
this _Section 10.11_. In no event shall any Contracting Party have any shared
or vicarious liability for the actions or omissions of any other person. No
person who is not a Contracting Party, including any current, former or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, affiliate, agent, financing source, attorney or Representative
or assignee of any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, affiliate, agent, financing source, attorney or Representative or
assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_
"), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in
equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil or any other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or
otherwise) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or their negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach, except with respect to willful misconduct
or common law fraud against the person who committed such willful misconduct
or common law fraud, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law;
and each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims,
causes of action and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the Nonparty Affiliates are intended third-
party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.11_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, none of the Contracting Parties or any Nonparty Affiliate
shall be responsible or liable for any multiple, consequential, indirect,
special, statutory, exemplary or punitive damages which may be alleged as a
result of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or any other agreement
referenced herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereunder or
thereunder, or the termination or abandonment of any of the foregoing.
