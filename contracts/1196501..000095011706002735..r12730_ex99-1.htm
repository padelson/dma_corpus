In order, however, that the full value of every contract or claim of the
character described 

--- 
  

in clauses (i) and (ii) above (the "Non-Assignable Contracts") may be realized
by the Buyer and

  

its Designated Subsidiaries, and with the understanding and agreement of the

the economic benefits and risks of the Business from and after the Closing
Date shall, be solely

  

for the account of the Buyer then the Seller and the Buyer shall cooperate to
establish an

  

arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller under which
the Buyer would

  

obtain, to the extent practicable, the claims, rights and benefits and assume
the corresponding

  

liabilities and obligations under the Non-Assignable Contracts (including by
means of any

  

subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) or under which the
Seller would enforce

  

for the benefit of the Buyer, with the Buyer assuming and agreeing to pay the

obligations, any and all claims, rights and benefits of the Seller against a
third party thereto. In

  

such event (i) subject to the following sentence, the Seller will promptly pay

liabilities arising

  

thereunder. Any services to be performed by the Seller pursuant to any Non-
Assignable

  

Contract shall be charged to the Buyer at the SellerÂ’s then prevailing
standard rates or, if less, the

  

rates that have been billed to the client pursuant to such Non-Assignable
Contract at any time

  

during the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof.

possession and

  

operating control of the Business Assets.

ARTICLE II. CLOSING, CONSIDERATION, ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES, ETC.

  



        

Section 2.01. Closing; Certain Matters Relating to Pre-Closing Transactions.

  |  


---|--- 
     

   |  

(a)

  |  

The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the 

       |    |    | 
  

"Closing") shall take place at the offices of WilmerHale, 399 Park Avenue, New
York, New

  

York, on (i) August 31, 2006, provided, that if the Closing occurs after
August 31, 2006 but prior

  

to September 30, 2006, the Closing shall be deemed to occur as of August 31,
2006 solely for

  

purposes of Section 2.06 or (ii) at such other place or at such other date and
time described in

  

Section 8.01(b) as the parties may mutually agree (such date and time of
closing being herein

  

called the "Closing Date").

        

(b)

  |  

From and after the Closing Date the economic benefits and risks of the 

---|--- 
  

Business shall be solely for the account of the Buyer.

        

(c)

  |  

Other than as expressly set forth in Section 2.04, all liabilities and 

---|--- 
  

obligations of the Seller prior to the Closing Date (collectively referred to
herein as the "Pre-

  

Closing Liabilities") shall be for the account of, and shall be the
responsibility of, the Seller.

  



        

Section 2.02. Consideration.

  |  


---|--- 
     

   |  

(a)

  |  

The aggregate consideration to be paid or delivered by the Buyer pursuant 

       |    |    | 
  

to this Agreement shall consist of (i) $80,000,000 in cash (subject to
adjustment pursuant to

  

Section 2.02(c)) (the "Closing Cash Consideration"), (ii) the assumption of
liabilities provided

  

for herein, (iii) the Common Stock Consideration (as defined in Section
2.02(b)), and (iv) the

  

contingent consideration to be paid by the Buyer pursuant to Section 2.07 (if
any).

        

(b)

  |  

The "Common Stock Consideration" shall mean 2,015,621 shares of 

---|--- 
  

common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Holdings ("Holdings Common Stock"),
subject to

  

adjustment as set forth in this Section 2.02(b). If the average per share
closing price of the

  

Holdings Common Stock on the NASDAQ National Market for the twenty (20)
trading days

  

ending as of the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (such
average, the "Closing

  

Trading Average") is greater than $9.9225 (such price, the "Initial Trading
Average"), the

  

number of shares of Holdings Common Stock to be issued at Closing shall be
decreased to an

  

amount equal to the quotient of (i) 2,015,621 multiplied by the Mean Trading
Average (as

  

defined herein), divided by (ii) the Closing Trading Average. The "Mean
Trading Average"

  

shall be equal to the quotient of the (A) sum of the Initial Trading Average
and the Closing

  

Trading Average, divided by (B) two. The number of shares of Holdings Common
Stock to be

  

issued to the Seller at Closing, the Initial Trading Average, the Mean Trading
Average and the

  
   

Closing Trading Average shall be proportionally adjusted following any stock
split, reverse stock

  

split, stock dividend or similar event affecting the Holdings Common Stock
after the date hereof.

        

(c)

  |  

If the total revenue attributable to the Business for the twelve months 

---|--- 
  

ending June 30, 2006 (as reflected in the financial statements prepared
pursuant to Section

  

5.01(j) and as may be adjusted under the terms of Section 2.08 (the "2006
Total Revenue")) is

  

less than $44,000,000, the Closing Cash Consideration payable at Closing shall
be reduced by an

  

amount equal to (i) $46,000,000 minus the 2006 Total Revenue, multiplied by
(ii) two (2).

        

(d)

  |  

The value of the intangible assets purchased pursuant to this Agreement 

---|--- 
  

shall be determined in a report (the "Valuation Report") to be prepared by the
independent

  

valuation firm (which firm shall be reasonably acceptable to the Seller) at
the BuyerÂ’s expense, a

  

copy of which shall be delivered to the Seller no later than November 15,
2006. The parties

  

hereto agree to allocate the consideration for Tax purposes consistent with
the manner

  

reasonably determined in the Valuation Report. Each of the Buyer and the
Seller shall timely

  

complete a Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060)
consistent with the

  

Valuation Report, shall provide a copy of such form to the other parties
hereto and shall file a

  

copy of such form with its federal income tax return for the period that
includes the Closing

  

Date. Each of the Buyer and the Seller further agrees not to take any position
inconsistent with

  

such allocations for any Tax or financial accounting purpose.

  



        

Section 2.03. Payment and Delivery to the Seller on the Closing Date. On the
Closing 

--- 
  

Date, in full consideration for (i) the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment
and delivery to the

  

Buyer on the Closing Date of the Business Assets, (ii) the assumption of
liabilities provided for

  

in Section 2.04 and (iii) the execution and delivery by the Seller of the
Ancillary Agreements as

  

contemplated by Section 5.01(g), (A) the Buyer or its Designated Subsidiary
shall pay to the

  

Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of
$80,000,000 (subject to

  

adjustment pursuant to Section 2.02(c), if any), and (B) Holdings shall issue
to the Seller the

  

Common Stock Consideration.

  



        

Section 2.04. Assumption of Liabilities. On the Closing Date, and as
additional 

--- 
  

consideration for the purchase of the Assets and the execution and delivery of
the Ancillary

  

Agreements, the Buyer shall execute and deliver to the Seller an assumption
agreement, in the

  

form included in the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
pursuant to which,

  

subject to Section 2.05, the Buyer shall assume, and agree to pay, perform and
discharge when

  

due, all liabilities and obligations (i) relating to or arising out of the
operation or conduct of the

  

Business or the operation, ownership, or use of the Business Assets from and
after the Closing

  

Date and (ii) of the Seller arising from and after July 1, 2006 with respect
to the Business that

under the terms of the

  

Client Contracts, the Vendor Agreements, the Real Property Leases, the Other
Agreements, the

  

Licenses, or under the terms of any other contract, agreement, license, lease,
sales order,

  

purchase order or other commitment that is entered into after the date hereof
and not prohibited

  

under Section 4.01(a) (other than any of the foregoing that shall not be
assigned or subject to a

  

reasonably satisfactory arrangement as contemplated by Section 1.03 of this
Agreement)

  

(collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities").

  



        

Section 2.05. Non-Assumption of Certain Liabilities. The Buyer is not
assuming, and 

--- 
  

shall not be deemed to have assumed, any liabilities or obligations of the
Seller of any kind or

  
   

nature whatsoever other than the Assumed Liabilities. Without limiting the
generality of the

  

foregoing, it is hereby agreed that, other than the Assumed Liabilities, the
Buyer is not assuming

  

any liability and shall not have any obligation for or with respect to:

        

(i)

  |  

any liabilities of the Seller or its stockholders or affiliates relating 

---|--- 
  

to the Business Assets or the Business that are incurred prior to the Closing
Date

  

(except as expressly provided in Section 2.04);

        

(ii)

  |  

any liability for Taxes (A) relating to the Business Assets or the 

---|---

affiliates that arise under the terms of a contract, agreement, license,
lease, sales

  

order, purchase order, or other commitment not included in the Business
Assets;

        

(iv)

  |  

any liabilities or obligations of the Seller or its stockholders or 

---|--- 
  

affiliates under any Plan (as defined in Section 3.01(k));

        

(v)

  |  

any intercompany accounts payable of the Seller;

  |  


---|---|--- 
     

(vi)

  |  

any liability or obligation of the Seller or its stockholders or 

  

affiliates arising out of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding to the
extent

  

based upon an event occurring or a claim arising (A) with respect to any
matter

  

arising under a Client Contract, prior to July 1, 2006 (subject to the

  

representations and warranties of the Seller contained herein) or (B) with
respect

  

to any matter not involving a Client Contract (i) prior to the Closing Date,
or

  

(ii) after the Closing Date in the case of claims attributable to acts
performed or

  

omitted by the Seller or its stockholders or affiliates prior to the Closing
Date; and

        

(vii)

  |  

any obligation of the Seller or its stockholders or affiliates under 

---|--- 
  

any employment or consulting relationships or arrangements.

  



        

Section 2.06. Post-Closing Adjustment. In addition to any adjustment made
pursuant to 

--- 
  

Section 2.02(c) above, the Closing Cash Consideration shall be subject to
post-closing

  

adjustment as follows:

        

(i)

  |  

Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall 

---|--- 
  

prepare and deliver to the Seller a calculation of the Closing Net Tangible
Asset

  

Value (as defined herein) of the Business. The Buyer shall prepare such

  

calculation using generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis

  

consistent with the financial statements prepared pursuant to Section 4.01(e)
and

  

the categories of assets and liabilities listed on Schedule 3.01(e). The
"Closing

  

Net Tangible Asset Value" shall mean the aggregate value of the fixed assets,

  

accounts receivable (net of reserves for uncollectable amounts or anticipated

  

adjustments, which reserves shall be consistent with the past experience of
the

  

Business, regardless of the SellerÂ’s past practice with respect to
establishing such

  

reserves), supplies and prepaid expenses, advances and deposits of the
Business

  

(the "Tangible Assets") as of the Closing Date less (A) any accounts
receivable

  

related to periods ending on or before June 30, 2006 and retained by the
Seller as

  

set forth on Schedule 2.08, and (B) the liabilities and operating expenses of
the

  

Business arising on or after June 30, 2006 and assumed by the Buyer pursuant
to

  

clause (i) under Section 2.04.

  
         

(ii)

  |  

The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer, within thirty (30) days of the 

---|--- 
  

delivery of such calculation (the "Asset Objection Deadline Date"), either a
notice

  

indicating that the Seller accepts such calculation or a detailed statement

  

describing its objections (if any) to such calculation. If the Seller delivers
to the

  

Buyer a notice accepting such calculation, or the Seller does not deliver a
written

  

objection to such calculation by the Asset Objection Deadline Date, then,

  

effective as of either the date of delivery of such notice of acceptance or as
of the

  

close of business on the Asset Objection Deadline Date, such calculation shall
be

  

deemed to be final. If the Seller timely objects to such calculation, the
Buyer and

  

Seller shall submit the issues in dispute to a mutually-agreed upon
independent

  

accounting firm. In such event, Buyer and Seller shall furnish to such firm
such

  

workpapers and other documents and information relating to the dispute as may

  

be requested by the accounting firm and the determination by such firm of the

  

Closing Net Tangible Asset Value shall be binding and conclusive. The Buyer

  

and Seller shall share equally the fees of the independent accountants
incurred

  

pursuant to this Section 2.06(ii).

        

(iii)

  |  

If the Closing occurs after August 31, 2006 and the Closing Net 

---|--- 
  

Tangible Asset Value of the Business is less than $8,000,000, the Seller shall
be

  

required to pay to the Buyer a cash amount equal to $8,000,000 minus the
Closing

  

Net Tangible Asset Value. If the Closing occurs on or prior to August 31, 2006

  

and the Closing Net Tangible Asset Value of the Business is less than
$5,330,000,

  

the Seller shall be required to pay to the Buyer a cash amount equal to
$5,330,000

  

minus the Closing Net Tangible Asset Value. The Seller shall pay to the Buyer

  

any such amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account

  

specified by the Buyer within three (3) business days after the Closing Net

  

Tangible Asset Value becomes binding and conclusive on the parties pursuant to

  

Section 2.06(ii).

  



        

Section 2.07. Contingent Consideration. In addition to the consideration set
forth in 

--- 
  

Section 2.02, on September 30, 2007, the Buyer shall pay to the Seller
additional cash

  

consideration as follows:

        

(a)

  |  

if the total revenue of the Business for the twelve (12) months ending 

---|--- 
  

June 30, 2007 (the "2007 Total Revenue") is less than the greater of (i) the
2006 Total Revenue

  

and (ii) $44,000,000 (the greater of (i) and (ii) being referred to herein as
the "2006 Revenue

  

Base"), no additional consideration shall be paid to the Seller; and

        

(b)

  |  

if the 2007 Total Revenue is at least equal to the 2006 Revenue Base, 

---|--- 
  

$5,000,000 in cash shall be paid to the Seller; and

        

(c)

  |  

if the 2007 Total Revenue is greater than the 2006 Revenue Base, an 

---|--- 
  

additional amount of cash equal to $10,000,000 multiplied by the Earn-out
Ratio (as defined

  

herein) shall be paid to the Seller. The "Earn-out Ratio" shall mean the
quotient of (i) the 2007

  

Total Revenue minus the 2006 Revenue Base, divided by (ii) $52,000,000 minus
the 2006

  

Revenue Base (provided that in no event shall the Earn-out Ratio be greater
than 1.0).

        

(d)

  |  

From and after the Closing Date until July 1, 2007, the Buyer shall operate 

---|--- 
  

the Business in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Schedule 2.07. On
or prior to August

  

15, 2007, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a calculation of
the 2007 Total

  

Revenue of the Business. The Buyer shall prepare such calculation using the
principles set forth

  
   

on Schedule 2.08. The Seller shall deliver to the Buyer, within thirty (30)
days of the delivery of

  

such calculation (the "Revenue Objection Deadline Date"), either a notice
indicating that the

  

Seller accepts such calculation or a detailed statement describing its
objections (if any) to such

  

calculation. If the Seller delivers to the Buyer a notice accepting such
calculation, or the Seller

  

does not deliver a written objection to such calculation by the Revenue
Objection Deadline Date,

  

then, effective as of either the date of delivery of such notice of acceptance
or as of the close of

  

business on the Revenue Objection Deadline Date, such calculation shall be
deemed to be final.

  

If the Seller timely objects to such calculation, the Buyer and Seller shall
submit the issues in

  

dispute to a mutually-agreed upon independent accounting firm. In such event,
Buyer and Seller

  

shall furnish to such firm such workpapers and other documents and information
relating to the

  

dispute as may be requested by the accounting firm and the determination by
such firm of the

  

2007 Total Revenue shall be binding and conclusive. The Buyer and Seller shall
share equally

  

the fees of the independent accountants incurred pursuant to this Section
2.07(d).

        

(e)

  |  

The Buyer shall pay to the Seller any amounts due pursuant to Sections 

---|--- 
  

2.07(b) and 2.07(c) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by

Calculation becomes

  

binding and conclusive on the parties pursuant to Section 2.07(d).

  



        

Section 2.08. Revenue Calculation. In determining the revenue of the Business

collect any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series
of Form W-8, as

  

applicable, or any similar information, from the Seller. To the extent that

Agreement as having

  

been delivered and paid to the recipient of payments in respect of which such
deduction and

  

withholding was made.

employees) primarily attributable to the announcement or pendency of the
transactions

  

contemplated by this Agreement; or (v) any action required to be taken

Agreement or by or at the request of Holdings or the Buyer.

        

(b)

than any state and federal antitrust laws and similar laws of general
application), any order of

  

any court or other agency of government, the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws of the

  

Seller, or any judgment, award or decree or any indenture, agreement or other
instrument to

  

which the Seller is a party, or by which the Seller or any of the Business

(xi)

  |  

entered into any agreement to take any action described in this 

---|--- 
  

Section 3.01(f).

        

(g)

  |  

Title to Properties, Absence of Liens and Encumbrances. Except as set 

---|--- 
  

forth in Schedule 3.01(g) or as may arise after the Closing Date as a result
of actions of the

  

Buyer, the Seller has good title to all the Assets, free and clear of all
liens, charges, pledges,

  

security interests or other encumbrances (each an "Encumbrance") of any nature
whatsoever,

  

except Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below). Except as set forth on said
Schedule, there

  

are not any liens securing Business Assets to be purchased by the Buyer
hereunder except such

  

as may have arisen in the ordinary course of business and which, individually
or in the aggregate,

  

would not have a Business Material Adverse Effect from and after the Closing
Date. Except as

  

set forth in Schedule 3.01(g), all leases of real or personal property of the
Seller to be assigned to

  

the Buyer hereunder are valid and binding in accordance with their respective
terms and there is

  

not under any of such leases any existing default, or any condition, event or
act that with notice

  

or lapse of time or both would constitute such a default, nor would
consummation of the

  

transactions contemplated hereby result in such a default or any such
condition, event or act that,

  

in any such case, would have a Business Material Adverse Effect from and after
the Closing

  

Date. The Business Assets constitute all of the assets or properties of the
Seller used by the

  

Seller exclusively or primarily in the Business (other than any such assets or
properties made

  

available to the Buyer pursuant to the agreements and arrangements described
in Sections

  

1.05(a)(i)-(v)) and this Agreement (including the Annexes hereto) and the
Ancillary Agreements

  

provide the Buyer with the right to use, on a nonexclusive basis, all assets
or properties of the

  

Seller used in the Business, but not exclusively or primarily. As used in this
Agreement, the

  

term "Permitted Encumbrance" means (A) any Encumbrance for taxes not yet due
or delinquent

  

or being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for which adequate
reserves have

  

been established, (B) any statutory Encumbrance arising in the ordinary course
of business by

  

operation of law with respect to a liability that is not yet due or
delinquent, (C) any minor

  

imperfection of title or similar Encumbrance that individually or in the
aggregate with other such

  

Encumbrances do not materially impair the value of the property subject to
such Encumbrance or

  
   

the use of such property in the conduct of the Business, and (D) any
Encumbrance created by the

  

Buyer on any of the Business Assets pursuant to the Financing.

        

   |  

(h)

  |  

Contracts; No Defaults.

  |  


---|---|---|--- 
     

(i)

  |  

Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.01(h)(i), there is no claim that 

       |    |    | 
  

any Client Contract, Vendor Agreement, Real Property Lease, License, or Other

  

Agreement (collectively, the "Transferred Agreements") is not valid and

  

enforceable in accordance with its terms for the periods stated therein; and
the

  

Seller is not in material default under any such Transferred Agreement nor is

  

there an event of default or event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would

  

constitute such a material default by the Seller and, to the SellerÂ’s
knowledge, (i)

  

no other party to any Transferred Agreement is in material default under such

  

Transferred Agreement, and (ii) there is no event of default or event that
with

  

notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a material default by
such

  

other party. Each Transferred Agreement is valid and enforceable in accordance

  

with its respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited
by

  

bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, reorganization or

  

other similar laws relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally, and,
to the

  

SellerÂ’s knowledge, there are no circumstances existing on the date hereof
that

  

would result in any such Transferred Agreement becoming invalid or

  

unenforceable. The pricing provisions contained in the Client Contracts and

  

Vendor Agreements that will be in effect for those periods from the date
hereof

  

until the end of the term for such Client Contracts or Vendor Agreements are

  

consistent with pricing provisions contained in similar agreements that are

  

included in the operating results reflected in the Annual Operating Statements
or

  

reflect current competitive conditions in the market and none of such Client

  

Contracts or Vendor Agreements provide for material reductions in pricing

  

subsequent to the date hereof from the price levels established in such
contracts

  

for periods prior to the date hereof.

        

(ii)

  |  

Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.01(h)(ii), there are no contracts, 

---|--- 
  

agreements, options, leases, licenses, sales and purchase orders, commitments,

  

and other obligations and undertakings of any kind, whether written or oral,
by

  

the Seller with any stockholder, director or officer thereof relating to the
Business

  

Assets or necessary for the operation of the Business.

        

(i)

  |  

Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.01(i) and except for claims 

---|--- 
  

involving, individually, amounts less than $100,000 and, in the aggregate, an
amount less than

  

$500,000, there are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings with
respect to the Business

  

involving claims by or against the Seller pending or, to the knowledge of the
Seller, threatened

  

against the Seller relating to any of the operations of the Business, at law
or in equity, or before

  

or by any federal, state, municipal or other governmental department,
commission, board,

  

bureau, agency or instrumentality. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.01(i),
there are no orders,

  

judgments or decrees of any court or governmental agency with respect to which
the Seller or

  

any stockholder or affiliate of the Seller has been named or is a party that
apply, in whole or in

  

part, to the Business or any of the Business Assets.

        

(j)

  |  

Collective Bargaining Agreements; Labor Controversies; Etc. Neither the 

---|--- 
  

Seller nor any stockholder or affiliate thereof is a party to any collective
bargaining agreement

  

with respect to any employees engaged in the operations of the Business. The
Seller is in

  
   

compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws respecting health
and occupational

  

safety, employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages

  

and hours with respect to employees engaged in the operations of the Business.
There are no

  

controversies between the Seller and any of its employees engaged in the
operations of the

  

Business that might reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse
Effect from and

  

after the Closing Date, or any unresolved labor union grievances or unfair
labor practice or labor

  

arbitration proceedings pending, or, to the knowledge of the Seller,
threatened against the Seller

  

relating to any of the operations of the Business, and, to the SellerÂ’s
knowledge, there are no

  

organizational efforts currently being made or threatened involving any of
such employees. The

  

Seller has not received notice of any claim that the Seller has not complied
with any laws

  

relating to the employment of labor, including any provisions thereof relating
to wages, hours,

  

collective bargaining, the payment of social security and similar taxes, equal
employment

  

opportunity, employment discrimination and employment safety with respect to
employees

  

engaged in the operations of the Business, or that the Seller is liable for
any arrears of wages or

  

any penalties for failure to comply with any of the foregoing. Schedule
3.01(j) sets forth the

  

names and current compensation rates of all employees (excluding temporary
employees) of the

  

Seller who were engaged exclusively in the day-to-day operations and support
of the Business as

  

of June 9, 2006 (the "Employees") and the number of temporary employees
engaged exclusively

  

in the day-to-day operations and support of the Business as of such date.

        

(k)

  |  

Employee Benefit Plans. The Seller has been and currently is in 

---|--- 
  

compliance in all material respects, both as to form and operation, with the
applicable provisions

  

of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
and the

  

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), respectively, with
respect to each

  

employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (a "Plan")
maintained for

  

the benefit of employees engaged in the operations of the Business by the
Seller or to which the

  

Seller contributes or is required to contribute. No event has occurred, and
there exists no

  

condition or set of circumstances that has resulted in, or that may be
reasonably expected to

  

result in, the imposition of any material liability on the Seller or Holdings
or the Buyer under

  

ERISA, the Code or other applicable law with respect to any Plan maintained
for the benefit of

  

employees engaged in the operations of the Business.

        

   |

below).

  

The Seller has taken reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature of
each

owned by the Seller (other than licenses granted to end users in the ordinary

  

course of business), and, to the knowledge of the Seller, no other person or
entity

  

is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of the Seller Intellectual
Property.

        

(ii)

  |  

None of the Customer Deliverables, or the marketing, distribution, 

---|--- 
  

provision or use thereof, infringes or violates in any material respect, or

  

constitutes a material misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property rights
of any

  

person or entity, and, neither the marketing, distribution, provision or use
of any

  

Customer Deliverables currently under development by Seller will, when such

  
   

Customer Deliverables are commercially released, infringe or violate in any

  

material respect, or constitute a material misappropriation of, any
Intellectual

  

Property rights of any person or entity. None of the Internal Systems, or the
use

  

thereof, infringes or violates, or constitutes a misappropriation of, any
Intellectual

  

Property rights of any person or entity. There are no current, unresolved

  

complaints, claims or notices, or written threats thereof, received by the
Seller

  

alleging any such infringement, violation or misappropriation.

        

(iii)

  |  

The Seller has not agreed to indemnify any person or entity against 

---|--- 
  

any infringement, violation or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property
rights

  

with respect to any Seller Intellectual Property.

        

(iv)

  |  

The Seller has not disclosed the source code for any software used 

---|--- 
  

in the Business, or other confidential information constituting, embodied in
or

  

pertaining to such software, to any person or entity, except pursuant to an

  

agreement requiring such person or entity to maintain the confidentiality of
such

  

source code or confidential information, and the Seller has taken reasonable

  

measures to prevent disclosure of such source code.

        

(v)

  |  

All of the copyrightable materials incorporated in or bundled with 

---|---

Seller

  

within the scope of their employment or engagement by the Seller or by

  

independent contractors of the Seller who have executed agreements expressly

  

assigning all right, title and interest in such copyrightable materials to the
Seller.

  

No portion of such copyrightable materials was jointly developed with any
third

  

party that has not been assigned to the Seller.

        

(vi)

  |  

Schedule 3.01(l)(vi) lists all Open Source Materials (as defined 

---|--- 
  

below) that the Seller has used in any way in connection with the Business and

  

describes the manner in which such Open Source Materials have been used by the

  

Seller, including, without limitation, whether and how the Open Source
Materials

  

have been modified and/or distributed by the Seller. Except as set forth in
the

  

Schedule 3.01(i)(vi), the Seller has not (i) incorporated any Open Source

  

Materials into, or combined Open Source Materials with, any Customer

  

Deliverables, (ii) distributed Open Source Materials in connection with any

  

Customer Deliverables, or (iii) used Open Source Materials that (with respect
to

  

either clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above) (A) create, or purport to create,

grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights or immunities under

  

intellectual property rights. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the

  

Seller has not used any Open Source Materials that require, as a condition of
use,

  

modification and/or distribution of such Open Source Materials, that other

  

software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such Open Source

programs, software and databases owned, leased or licensed by the Seller
(except

  

those "off-the-shelf" programs generally available to the public and used by
the

  

Seller primarily outside the operations of the Business) and used to carry on
the

  
   

operations of the Business.

        

(viii)

  |

(d)

  |  

The Buyer has previously delivered to the Seller a copy of a proposed 

---|--- 
  

bank commitment letter providing for a term loan and revolving credit facility

transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to

on terms comparable to those proposed in the commitment letter, (B) to satisfy

has become

  

unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, to obtain alternative

other sources on and subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as
that portion that

  

has become unavailable and (E) to satisfy at or prior to the Closing all
requirements of any

  

agreements under the Financing is to be provided and conditions to the
drawdown of proceeds

  

thereunder. The Buyer agrees that it will use commercially reasonable efforts
to exercise all of

  

its rights to enforce performance of any agreements under that the Buyer is
entitled to receive the

  

Financing with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
will not waive,

  

modify or amend any of its rights under such agreements in any material
respect.

        

(e)

  |  

The Buyer agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, it will offer to 

---|--- 
  

continue the employment of all Employees, whether such Employees are active,
on leave or on

  

short-term disability, it being understood that, to the maximum extent
permitted or allowed by

  

applicable law, such employment shall be employment at will. Any such offer of
employment to

  

an Employee shall be for substantially comparable rates of pay (including,
without limitation

  

annual base salary and bonus) as in effect immediately prior to the Closing.
The Buyer also

  

agrees to recognize all vacation and sick days for which Retained Employees
(as defined in

  

Section 4.02(f)) would qualify during the balance of the calendar year based
on (A) with respect

  

to vacation days, the duration of their employment by the Seller in accordance
with the policies

  

of the Seller prior to the Closing Date and (B) with respect to sick days, the
duration of their

  
   

employment by the Seller in accordance with the policies of the Seller prior
to the Closing Date.

  

For purposes of this Section 4.02(e), the term "continued employment" shall
mean with respect

  

to position, "substantially the same duties in the same functional area", it
being understood and

  

agreed, however, that nothing in this Section 4.02(d) shall require the Buyer
(A) to provide or

  

continue for the benefit of any employees any bonus or other compensation plan
or arrangement

  

or any other employee benefit plan currently maintained by the Seller or any
affiliate thereof, or

  

(B) to maintain the organizational structure of the Business in effect on the
date hereof. The

  

foregoing notwithstanding, this Section 4.02(e) shall not apply to the
employees of the Seller

  

listed on Schedule 4.02(e) that are entering into employment agreements with
the Buyer on or

  

about the Closing Date.

        

(f)

  |  

Employees who accept the BuyerÂ’s offer of employment ("Retained 

---|--- 
  

Employees") shall be entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans
maintained by Holdings

  

or the Buyer for their employees generally, on the same terms and conditions;
provided that

  

employment service of Retained Employees as recognized by the Seller under its
Plans shall be

  

recognized under the BuyerÂ’s employee benefit plans and arrangements. Holdings
and the Buyer

  

shall make available to Retained Employees medical, hospitalization and
similar fringe benefits

  

reasonably comparable to those offered to comparable employees of Holdings and
the Buyer;

  

provided, that Holdings and the Buyer shall waive all actively-at-work
provisions of such benefit

  

plans, shall waive all waiting periods for such benefit plans and give prior
service credit for any

  

plans that have such a requirement, and shall waive any previously satisfied
deductibles and out-

  

of-pocket maximums for medical and dental plans, subject to proof of payment
by the Retained

  

Employee. To the extent permitted by law and the provisions of BuyerÂ’s
employee benefit plans,

  

Retained Employees may elect to roll their 401(k) retirement plan account
balances over to a

  

qualified plan sponsored by the Buyer, and may include in such rollovers loan
balances, which

  

shall be then administered under the BuyerÂ’s qualified retirement plan in
accordance with the

  

terms and conditions of the original loan notes. To the extent permitted by
law and the

  

provisions of the BuyerÂ’s flexible spending account plan, Retained Employees
participating in a

  

flexible spending account plan sponsored by the Seller shall have their
account balances rolled

  

into a similar plan sponsored by the Buyer and shall participate in such plan
in accordance with

  

its terms.

be true and correct in all material respects on and as of such date) with only
such failures to so be

  

true as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

certificate to that effect.

        

(b)

favorable opinion of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart Nicholson Graham LLP, counsel
for the Seller,

The Seller is a corporation validly existing and in good standing 

---|--- 
  

under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is licensed or

  

qualified as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction set forth on a

terms of any agreement or instrument listed on a schedule to such opinion to

claims resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties shall be
subject to the following

  

terms and conditions:

        

(a)

  |  

within 20 days after receipt of notice of commencement of any action or

by a third party, the

  

party to be indemnified shall give the indemnifying party written notice
thereof together with a

  

copy of such claim, process or other legal pleading, and the indemnifying
party shall have the

  

right to respond to such action, claim, audit or inquiry and to undertake the
defense thereof with

  

counsel reasonably satisfactory to the party to be indemnified; provided that
(i) the indemnifying

  

party may only assume control of such defense if (A) it acknowledges in
writing to the party to

  

be indemnified that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be
assessed against the

  

party to be indemnified in connection with such action constitute Damages for
which the party to

than or equal to the amount of damages for which the indemnifying party is
liable under this

notice of any such claim, audit or inquiry (or, if earlier, by the tenth day
preceding the day on

  

which an answer or other pleading must be served in order to prevent judgment
by default in

  

favor of the person asserting such claim), does not elect to defend against
such claim, the party to

  

be indemnified will (upon further notice to the indemnifying party) have the
right to respond to

  

such action, claim, audit or inquiry and to undertake the defense, compromise
or settlement of

  

such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the indemnifying
party, provided that the

  

indemnifying party shall be given at least 15 daysÂ’ prior written notice to
the effectiveness of any

  

such proposed settlement or compromise and provided that such settlement or
compromise shall

  

not be effected without the consent of the indemnifying party, which consent
shall not be

  

unreasonably withheld or delayed;

have the right, at its own cost and expense, to compromise or settle such
claim, but (ii) the

  

indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the party
to be indemnified,

  

settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment that
does not include as

reasonable times and at

  

the expense of the party requesting such information) upon request as promptly
as practicable

  

such information (including access to books and records pertinent to the
Business) and assistance

  

relating to the Business as is reasonably necessary for the preparation,
review and audit of

defense of any claim, suit

  

or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment, provided that access shall
be limited to items

application for a Tax

  

Clearance Certificate made pursuant to this Section 7.06, any Governmental
Authority asserts

  

that the Seller is liable for any Tax, the Seller shall promptly pay any and

Schedule 2.07 Â– Operating Guidelines

  



        

1.

  |  

The parties agree that the guidelines set forth in this Schedule shall be used
in 

---|--- 
  

conducting the Business after the Closing and until July 1, 2007 (the "Earn-
Out Period"). The

  

parties acknowledge that meeting or exceeding the 2006 Revenue Base will be
required in order

  

for all or a portion of contingent consideration contemplated by Section 2.07
of the Agreement to

  

be payable.

        

2.

  |  

Holdings and the Buyer agree with the Seller that, during the Earn-Out Period:

  |  


---|---|--- 
     

   |  

(a)

  |  

Holdings and the Buyer shall maintain separate records of the Business so 

       |    |    | 
  

as to render a determination of the 2007 Total Revenue practicable and shall
keep accurate and

  

complete records, files and account books containing all of the data
reasonably required for the

  

computation and verification of revenues during the Earn-Out Period. Upon
written request from

  

the Seller, Holdings and the Buyer agree to permit the Seller or its designee
to examine such

  

records, files and account books upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours.

        

(b)

  |  

Holdings and the Buyer shall provide Seller with reasonably detailed 

---|--- 
  

reports setting forth the revenues for the Business for each fiscal quarter

category within thirty (30) days following the end of each fiscal quarter
during the Earn-Out

  

Period.

        

(c)

  |  

Holdings and the Buyer shall comply in all material respects with all laws,

regulations and administrative orders of any federal, state or local

(d)

  |  

Holdings and the Buyer shall, subject to the other provisions of this 

---|--- 
  

Schedule, take all steps that are reasonably necessary to continue to operate

manner that affords the Seller the opportunity to earn the maximum potential
contingent

  

consideration contemplated under Section 2.07 of the Agreement.

        

3.

  |  

It is the intention of Holdings and the Buyer to have the day-to-day
operations of 

---|--- 
  

the Business managed by Mr. Curtin and Ms. Glenn, who will report directly to
HoldingsÂ’ Chief

  

Operating Officer, and by Messrs. Frey and Singh, who will report to Ms.
Glenn. It is also the

  

intention of Holdings and the Buyer to maintain the current organizational
structure of the

  

Business (except that personnel responsible for managed care contracts will
report to Ms.

  

Dragonetti) and its current headcount and to provide sales and marketing
support to the Business

  

consistent with the levels reflected in the Financial Information provided to
Holdings and the

  

Buyer pursuant to the Agreement.

        

4.

  |  

Holdings and the Buyer agree with the Seller that they will not modify or
change 

---|--- 
  

any of the business plans outlined in the preceding paragraph in any manner or
take any other

  

action that would in any material respect adversely affect the prospects for
the Business meeting

  

the maximum revenue target of Section 2.07, unless such modification, change
or action is made

  

by Holdings and the Buyer in good faith (i) to respond to changes in
circumstances affecting the

  

Business that are unanticipated as of the date hereof (including the
unprofitability of any services

  

or projects), (ii) to further a legitimate business purpose that it is the
best interests of the overall

  

business of Holdings and the Buyer, or (iii) to comply with any laws,
ordinances, governmental

  

rules or regulations applicable to Holdings, the Buyer or the Business.

        

5.

  |  

In the event Holdings or the Buyer shall at any time prior to the end of the
Earn- 

---|--- 
  

Out Period (i) discontinue the offering of any of the types of services
currently offered by the

  

Business, or (subject to paragraph 6) sell or otherwise dispose of a material
portion of the

  

Business Assets acquired pursuant to the Agreement, in each case under
circumstances not

  

contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of paragraph 4, or (ii)
unilaterally terminate any Client

  

Contract prior to the end of its term, whether or not the circumstances
contemplated by clauses

  

(i), (ii) or (iii) of paragraph 4 apply, Holdings and the Buyer agree to
negotiate with the Seller in

  

good faith to make such adjustments of the definitions of the terms 2006

which may include

  

(i) annualizing the revenue recognized during the Earn-out Period for the
discontinued service or

  

contract or for any services associated with the disposed assets through the
date of such

  

discontinuance or disposition and/or (ii) proportionately reducing the 2006
Revenue Base and the

  

2007 Total Revenue target to reflect the reduced level of services offered by
the Business.

        

6.

  |  

In the event Holdings or the Buyer shall at any time prior to the end of the
Earn- 

---|--- 
  

Out Period sell or other dispose of all or substantially all the Business
Assets acquired pursuant

  

to the Agreement, or discontinue all or substantially all the services
currently offered by the

  

Business, in each case whether or not under the circumstances contemplated by
clauses (i), (ii) or

  

(iii) of paragraph 4, the Buyer shall, subject to the following sentence, pay
to the Seller the

  

maximum contingent consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.07 within five
business days of

  

such disposition or discontinuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
paragraph 6 shall not

  
   

apply to any transaction or series of related transactions involving the sale
or other disposition of

  

all or substantially all the consolidated assets of Holdings, or a merger,
consolidation or other

  

transaction involving the acquisition of a majority of the outstanding common
stock of Holdings.

  



  



  

Schedule 2.08 Â– Revenue Calculation Guidelines

        

In determining the revenue of the Business for purposes of Sections 2.02(c)
and 2.07, 

--- 
  

revenue shall be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles

  

consistently applied and as modified in accordance with the principles set
forth below:

        

1.

  |  

Revenue for recovery work will be recognized for purposes of Section 2.02(c) 

---|--- 
  

only if (i) the Seller has performed all required work during the year ending
June 30, 2006, (ii)

  

payment from the responsible third party is received by the client by June 30,
2006 and (iii) the

  

payment is reconciled and the relevant invoice issued by the Seller by August
15, 2006.

        

For purposes of recognizing revenue from recovery work during the year ending
June 30, 

--- 
  

2007 pursuant to Section 2.07, the same principles shall apply to the conduct
of the Business by

  

the Buyer, except that the payment must be reconciled and the relevant invoice
must be issued by

  

July 31, 2007.

        

2.

  |  

For projects involving the addition of names to insurance rolls, it has been
the 

---|--- 
  

practice of the Seller to invoice clients when they have uploaded the data
delivered by the Seller

  

to their own systems. Revenue associated with such projects will be recognized
for purposes of

  

Section 2.02(c) only if (i) the Seller has performed all required work and
delivered the data to the

  

client during the year ending June 30, 2006 and (ii) the client has uploaded
the data and the

  

Seller has issued the relevant invoice by August 15, 2006.

        

For purposes of recognizing revenue from similar projects during the year
ending June 

--- 
  

30, 2007 pursuant to Section 2.07, the same principles shall apply to the
conduct of the Business

  

by the Buyer, except that the client must upload the data and the relevant
invoice must be issued

  

by July 31, 2007.

        

3.

  |  

For recoupment projects for State Medicaid agencies involving the
identification 

---|--- 
  

of healthcare claims that are not the responsibility of such agencies, it has
been the practice of

  

the Seller to invoice the agencies when they notify the Seller that they have
retained amounts

  

identified by the Seller that are otherwise payable to healthcare providers.
Revenue associated

  

with such projects will be recognized for purposes of Section 2.02(c) only if
(i) the Seller has

  

performed all required work and delivered the data to the client during the
year ending June 30,

  

2006 and (ii) the client has notified the Seller of its retention of claimed
amounts and the Seller

  

has issued the relevant invoice by August 15, 2006.

        

For purposes of recognizing revenue from similar projects during the year
ended June 30, 

--- 
  

2007 pursuant to Section 2.07, the same principles shall apply to the conduct
of the Business by

  

the Buyer, except that the client must notify the Buyer of the retention of
claims and the relevant

  

invoice must be issued by July 31, 2007.

        

4.

  |  

All accounts receivable (and all collections thereof) arising from revenue 

---|--- 
  

recognized for purposes of Section 2.02(c) in accordance with the principles
outlined above shall

  

be included within the term "Excluded Assets" and shall be retained by the
Seller as provided in

  

Section 1.02.

        

5.

  |  

Revenue generated under any Non-Assignable Contract will be included in the 

---|--- 
  

calculation of 2007 Total Revenue if (i) arrangements have been established
pursuant to Section

  
   

1.04 for the Buyer to obtain, to the extent practicable, the claims, rights
and benefits and to

  

assume the corresponding liabilities and obligations under such contract (by
means of any

  

subcontracting or similar arrangement) and (ii) such revenue would otherwise
be recognized in

  

accordance with the principles set forth in this Schedule 2.08.

        

6.

  |  

All revenue recognized pursuant to this Schedule 2.08 will be subject to such 

---|--- 
  

reserves for uncollectable amounts or anticipated adjustments as are required
by generally

  

accepted accounting principles and as are consistent with the past experience
of the Business,

  

regardless of past practice with respect to establishing such reserves.

        

7.

  |  

For purposes of calculating 2007 Total Revenue, the revenue of the Business
will 

---|--- 
  

be based on revenues from:

        

(a)

  |  

any clients of the Business having a contractual relationship with the 

---|--- 
  

Seller as of the date of this Agreement (including (i) any client that is a
party to a Non-

  

Assignable Contracts referred to in paragraph 5 above, and (ii) clients that
are joint clients of the

  

Buyer and the Seller, to the extent of the services provided by the Business)
and will include

  

additional projects provided to such clients, as well as any expansion of the
scope of services so

  

provided;

        

(b)

  |  

work performed for clients of the Business under contracts in effect at any 

---|--- 
  

time within twelve (12) months of date of this Agreement attributable to the
completion of such

  

contracts;

        

(c)

  |  

new clients that are secured by the Business between the date of the 

---|--- 
  

Agreement and the Closing Date that are not currently clients of either the
Seller or the Buyer;

        

(d)

  |  

clients of the Business and/or the Buyer after the date of this Agreement 

---|--- 
  

for those services offered by the Business that are not offered by the Buyer
to any material extent

  

as of the date of this Agreement ("Unique BSPA Services"), whether such
clients are sourced by

  

former employees of the Business, the Buyer or a combination thereof; and

        

(e)

  |  

clients for services or products other than Unique BSPA Services that 

---|--- 
  

result from joint sales and marketing activities involving material
participation from both

  

personnel of the Buyer and former employees of the Business after the Closing
Date with a

  

portion of such revenue to be included in 2007 Total Revenue based on the
relative contributions

  

of such persons to securing such revenue, as determined in good faith by the
Buyer.
